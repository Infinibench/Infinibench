            "Only Potter knew what happened to the $8000. The only thing that the people at Bailey's Building & Loan knew, is, Uncle Billy lost the $8000 and could not find it. Potter then set the bank examiner on George Bailey after George admitted that his company misplaced $8000.If Potter was caught with the money, and the Bailey family could prove it belonged to their Building and Loan, Potter would be arrested. Unfortunately the only way to prove it would be either Uncle Billy regaining his scattered memory, or Potter reporting himself.",
            "Put simply, \"boys will be boys\": i.e., will act recklessly, and make mistakes. In this case, George and Harry did not expect the ice to break under them, but misjudged it to be strong enough for their weight; or, alternatively, did not expect to land on the ice at all, but to stop before the pond began.",
            "The absence of George, meant the absence of his honest financial practices, which kept his neighbors prosperous. As a result, the only financial and economic force in the town, was his miserly rival, Mr. Potter.The town has been renamed \"Pottersville\", and it's a garish place of night clubs, bars, strip joints, pawnbrokers, girlie shows, etc.. Bailey's Park, the building project instituted by the B&L, is an old cemetery. Instead of going to New York, Violet Bick (Gloria Grahame) became a stripper/prostitute. Mr. Gower the druggist (H.B. Warner) is a drunkard and panhandler after spending 20 years in prison for an accidental poisoning. Ernie Bishop the taxi driver (Frank Faylen), instead of parachuting into France during the war, lives in a shack, his wife and kid having run away three years ago. Uncle Billy is in an insane asylum. George's brother Harry (Todd Karns), instead of earning the Congressional Medal of Honor for shooting down 15 airplanes, died at the age of eight. Mary never married and has turned into a spinster librarian.",
            "Many viewers have noticed, in George's reality, Mary does not wear glasses. In the alternate reality, however, she is shown wearing glasses: apparently, merely as a dramatic device, to symbolize her profession of librarian.The most common in-universe explanation is that Mary spends so much time reading (possibly in dim light), she ended up straining her eyes. Alternatively, in George's reality, Mary did not read a lot, so she didn't need glasses. Both explanations are based on the idea that reading too much causes one to need glasses: an idea prevalent in the 1940s but since disproven.Others speculate, Mary needs glasses in both realities, but doesn't wear them in George's reality, because it was a popular belief in the 1940s that \"boys don't make passes at girls who wear glasses.\" This does not consist with her more accurate aim, earlier in the film, when throwing stones to make a wish; but the combination of these images, suggests she is farsighted (i.e., better able to see at a distance than nearby). It is also speculated, Mary in the alternate reality suffered an illness that might not have happened, had George been there (presumably to look after her, or to recommend her to a doctor in time).The most likely explanation is, the screenwriters were exploiting a common stereotype of older, unmarried woman dressed in glasses and dowdy clothes, with their hair in buns, who serve as librarians, teachers, or nurses. They also gave her a rather ungainly way of walking in this scene, as to suggest she had neglected her posture.",
            "Although French chemist Louis Pasteur (1822-1895) discovered germs in 1860, the common cold virus was not known until the 1950s. Until then, it was believed that colds were caused by becoming chilled, such as not wearing a hat or shoes or not buttoning one's coat. If Zuzu were real, her \"cold\" would have been contracted a few days before (cold viruses usually take about three days to manifest symptoms), and was only noticed at the moment it is, when she showed signs of it. \"Keeping warm\" is a common folk-remedy or household treatment for a virus of any sort, and would have been recommended by George in any case."

Now it became obvious that Colbert had visited Endicott in his greenhouse, the plant stuck to his shoes, and he drove back to town where he met his killer.

Delores panics and races back outside into the arms of Ralph Henshaw (Anthony James), just as her brother Lloyd (James Patterson) drives up with a half dozen or so good old boys. As they advance toward Virgil with their guns, pipes, brass knuckles, and bottles of booze, Virgil stops them by telling Lloyd to look into Delores' purse where he'll find the $100 she got from Ralph for the abortion. \"He got her to tell you that Sam Wood did it,\" Virgil explains. \"He made a fool out of you, Purdy.\" Against Delores' screams that Virgil is a \"stinking liar\", Lloyd does as Virgil says and finds the money. As Lloyd turns his gun on Ralph, Ralph shoots him. In the chaos that follows, Virgil grabs Ralph's gun and holds the group at bay. Later, in Gillespie's office, Ralph confesses to accidentally killing Colbert when he attempted to rob him to get the money for Delores' abortion.

            "It's not explained in the film but they likely, out of respect for his years of loyal service (The Godfather Part II (1974) reveals that he has been working with Vito and Clemenza since the late 1910s or early 1920s) to the family and Vito, took him somewhere they could kill him quietly and dispose of his body in a non-messy fashion. They might also have given him a more merciful death, one that was quicker and more painless than what they did to Carlo.",
            "The film is mainly a representation of how Michael, the only honest son of Vito and Carmela, who at first does not want to enter \"the family business\", becomes a ruthless Mafia Don, a murderer and a liar, who even betrays his own family in this way in order to be recognized as a Mafia Don by his lieutenants.",
            "When they are about to kill somebody they want to be sure that he doesn't suspect anything. In this case Michael still needed to extract information from Carlo. Michael told him about the ticket and that he wouldn't widow his sister like that. Carlo bought into it and admitted his betrayal and revealed who hired him. It's possible that while Michael and likely Vito were certain that Carlo had set up Sonny, they weren't 100% and Michael needed Carlo to admit it. So by saying he already knows, and Carlo will simply be exiled instead of killed, Carlo admits his guilt. Only after Michael got what he wanted, the kill was executed. Michael's appearance at the front door was the signal to kill Carlo.\nOne could still argue why he wasn't killed right away in the house after the confession, though. Killing him in the car avoids a mess inside the house. If needed, the car could be dumped or disposed of. In the novel, the description of Carlo's execution is more graphic, noting that his bowels and bladder let loose and he soiled himself in the process.",
            "In Italian/Sicilian tradition, a Mafioso's wife is not allowed to ask their husband about their affairs, so Michael was quite frustrated at Kay's inquiries about his affairs. But Michael allows her to ask one time since, as an outsider, she was unaware of this tradition. He lies to her because he knows that if she was told the truth, she wouldn't want to stay with Michael. It also signifies that Michael has completed his transformation into the cold, ruthless mafioso that we see in Part II.\nMoreover, Michael's answer of \"no\" to Kay's question is technically correct. Remember, Kay's question was \"Is it true?\" what Connie claimed: which was that Michael killed Carlo.\nClemenza was the one who actually killed Carlo, so Michael can rationalize in his mind that he's not 'really' lying to Kay.\nThis is very similar to earlier in the film, at the big meeting of the five families, when Vito vows that he would not be the one to break the peace (again, Vito was technically honest; it was Micheal who implemented the murders of the Mafia bosses, despite that fact that Vito clearly helped orchestrate them in advance before his death).",
            "Although Michael knows Carlo had a tendency to beat up Connie, the 'farce' that he's talking about is the specific beating that led to Sonny's death. Connie gets a call, presumably from Carlo's mistress. She goes haywire, smashing things-which leads Carlo to beat her with his belt. Connie calls Sonny, who races out to help her-and is ambushed along the way by rival thugs who kill him. It seems like a spontaneous tragedy, but Michael knows it was all staged--the fight and the beating--to lure Sonny out so he could be assassinated.While he stayed in the Corleone family compound -- in the novel it's referred to as \"The Mall\", a collection of houses surrounded by a high wall that the Don bought years before to house his family -- Sonny was well-protected; he needed to follow that protocol if he wanted to stay alive and conduct the war. So he ventured out rarely, like he would to carry on his affair with Lucy Mancini. Whenever he did, he had at least a dozen Corleone operatives with him for protection.When Connie called Sonny, his famous hair-trigger temper was instantly ignited and he rushed out to help her without thinking about it. He then drove fast and far enough ahead of the men Tom sent after him that it cost him his life at the toll plaza.In the end, Michael gets Carlo to admit he only started the fight with Connie to lure Sonny away from his protection.",

One tube shot a blast of compressed air to shatter the lens -- likely made of sugar glass, which is significantly weaker than real glass -- and the 2nd tube sprayed fake blood on actor Alex Rocca's face. The two tubes were carefully concealed in Rocca's hair and ran behind him to the FX crewmember(s) who triggered the effect.",

            "His cheek was shattered when McCluskey punched him in the face outside the hospital. It's explained in the novel that McCluskey aimed for that spot very deliberately because that area of the cheek has a nerve bundle, so the blow was very painful and damaging. While Michael hides out in Sicily, a doctor named Taza says he can have surgery to fix it but Michael is reluctant because the man doesn't have a good reputation for his work.Michael eventually has his face fixed when he returns to the United States and the surgery works well to restore his looks.",

            "Remember that Barzini is a very shrewd and crafty don; he's able to turn Carlo against the family he married into and betray Sonny. Barzini likely had dozens of his own men doing spy-like work to monitor Sonny's habits: when he would leave the Corleone compound, where he'd go, who he would meet with. So Barzini would rely on intelligence reports from his men to eventually figure out a pattern that would allow him to launch an attack.Barzini must also have been crafty enough to have his spies monitor other aspects of the Corleone's dealings: how often they moved shipments of black market goods, where their men were stationed throughout the city, whom the Corleone's higher ranking lieutenants would meet with and when. One such aspect that's outside those bounds of the family's dealings was finding out about Carlo's bitter feelings toward his father-in-law. The beating that Sonny gives to Carlo earlier on was very public -- it took place on the street, right in front of the bookie's office that Carlo managed for the Don. Upon seeing that happening, Barzini's men could investigate further and probably found out that Carlo horribly abuses Connie and that Sonny was the fierce older brother who wouldn't hesitate to defend his sister's honor by beating up Carlo.As for hitting Sonny at Lucy Mancini's apartment in the city, Sonny, having taken over his father's position as Don, almost never went anywhere without several bodyguards. Not only would he have a few men in his car with him, but there would probably be at least one other car following them. So Sonny kept himself well-protected. Also, Lucy's apartment was likely in a neighborhood of New York that lay within the Corleone territory, providing further protection. If there was trouble of any kind, Sonny's men could call other Corleone men to action at the site for protection if an enemy made a move against Sonny. Such a move would be too risky for any enemy to make.Such a move by Barzini was years in the planning: they had to lure Carlo over to Barzini's side -- not that hard since Carlo was so disgruntled with his shabby treatment by the Don. They might have given Carlo a date and timeframe to spark the fight with Connie. The woman who called Carlo and Connie's number to cancel the \"date\" he had with her was probably a Barzini operative and the Barzini people knew that Sonny would rush to Connie's aid, thereby leaving the compound. Sonny, who was absolutely enraged at Carlo's brazen defiance, made a big mistake in racing out of the compound without waiting for his bodyguards. Barzini's men picked the toll booths as a perfect spot to bottleneck Sonny for the assassination.",
            "Fredo was considered weak. He did not provide any visible support to the Corleone family and proved he was not reliable to carry out family endeavors. When Vito was ambushed Fredo fumbled his gun, giving the assassins even more time to shoot his father. He was also very drunk at the wedding. A Don can never appear as weak outside of their family.Vito never wanted Michael in \"the life\". Michael also had no interest in being a part of it either. However, Michael felt he was forced in it to protect his father and once Sonny was killed, he had no choice but to assume the leadership role until Vito recovered, which never really happened. Nobody ever considered Fredo to be the next leader.",
            "Most likely it was Stockholm Syndrome after being abused for so many years that Connie truly believed she deserved it and that Carlo still loved her. Abusive and dysfunctional relationships don't often abide by rational thought processes. Connie may have also been angry with Michael for leaving her child without a father.",
            "Sollozzo was waiting to hear about the Don's condition at the hospital. The Don was shot probably around 4-5pm, right as he was leaving his office for the day. He was likely transported to the hospital very quickly -- depending on how far away the nearest hospital to his office was -- and probably rushed to surgery very quickly after being triaged in the emergency room. As fast the doctors could assess him and send him into surgery, it still takes time once he's there.What Sollozzo wanted to find out was if the Don was truly and finally dead. Sollozzo likely already knew -- at the time he placed the phone call -- that the Don had been admitted and was at least in surgery or may have come out of the O.R. and was sent to recovery. News in the 1940s traveled fast for the time and Sollozzo undoubtedly had either an informant on the hospital staff or had at least one of his or Tattaglia's men at the hospital to provide him with regular updates, despite whatever measures the Corleones would have taken to keep the Don's condition guarded.However, Sollozzo was overconfident: when he lets Tom go, he's actually still waiting for a final report from his informant/operative but he has that conversation with Tom where he reveals to Tom that the Don was gunned down outside his office. He tells Tom that Vito is most surely dead but he's wrong, which he finds out when he talks to his man while he lets Tom go.",
            "Vito, as the Don of the Corleone family, was against allowing his people dealing narcotics. Vito considered such a product to be much more dangerous than alcohol, gambling and prostitution, the mainstays of business conducted amongst the Five Families. He believed that the politicians and judges that did business with his family, enabling them to become as powerful as they were, wouldn't be willing to continue to do so if his business was drugs. Virgil Sollozzo, a big-time drug dealer, wanted the Corleones on his side because of their numerous connections with politicians and judges. Sollozzo hoped those people could be influenced, coerced or bribed to be lax on the trade of illegal drugs, but Vito refused. However, Sollozzo noticed that Sonny was interested in doing business with him, so he arranged for a hit on Vito, which would place Sonny as the new Don and then, hopefully, a deal with the Corleones would soon follow.",
            "Don Vito was suspicious of Sollozzo. So he asked Luca to pretend to be unhappy with the Corleone family and go to the Tattaglias to find out what he could about their deal with Sollozzo. When meeting with Bruno Tattaglia and Sollozzo, Sollozo offers Luca $50,000 to come and work for him instead. When Sollozzo offers his hand to make the deal, Luca doesn't accept it. This may be because Luca thinks of himself as honourable, knowing he wasn't actually betraying the Corleones, he couldn't in good conscience shake Sollozzo's hand to make the deal, which tipped Sollozzo that Luca was trying to spy (or he simply took offense to the snub) which is why he stabs Luca in his right hand while one of Tattaglia's men strangled Luca. He may have also become suspicious that someone like Luca, who had a reputation for being a fiercely loyal Corleone enforcer would so easily betray them for some money. Michael may have become aware of this; as in The Godfather Part III, he tells Vincent to go to Don Altobello and act displeased with Michael, but if Altobello asked him to betray Michael, to act offended, because that would be his trap to determine his loyalty. Alternatively, Sollozzo needed Luca out of the way because he was already planning the hit on Vito and even if he hoped Luca's defection was real, Luca likely wouldn't be happy about them killing Vito. So Luca had to die. As Tom says, \"Not even Sonny will be able to call off Luca Brasi\", to which Sollozo replied, \"Yeah, well let me worry about Luca\", as he already had him taken care of.",
            "Because Sollozzo and the Tattaglia Family knew that Fredo was only a harmless and incompetent man. Fredo was not a major member of the Corleone Family and would never take on a position of power, so Sollozzo decides to have his men kill Vito and kill Fredo only if he poses a real threat to them, as killing Fredo would only cause additional bad blood and make Sonny even less likely to agree to a truce and commit further violent actions against the Tattaglias.",
            "It's explained in the book, but not very well in the film. Sicilian and Italian tradition dictates that NO ONE, no matter how powerful or influential, will interfere in an Italian/Sicilian marriage. Vito is a very traditional man and had no intention of intruding in his daughter's marriage, even if it meant that Carlo (Gianni Russo) was abusive and unfaithful. There's a brief moment in the film when everyone is eating lunch after Vito returns home from the hospital where Connie and Carlo are arguing. Carlo tells Connie to shut up, Sonny tells Carlo never to say that to her, and Sonny's mother quietly tells Sonny \"don't interfere.\" In the novel, Connie goes to her parents a few times to tell them how abusive Carlo is but her parents, especially the Don, are very coldly unsympathetic to her plight and tell her to go home and learn how to be an obedient wife who won't be physically abused. Of course, no matter how Connie acts in the film or novel, dutiful or not, Carlo continues to beat her and eventually uses his abuse as a ruse to entice Santino to leave his compound without protection which is when he was murdered on the causeway. One aspect of the novel is that Vito and the rest of the family disapproved of Connie getting married to Carlo because they correctly sensed that Carlo is a cowardly thug and bully who targets and abuses weaker people, and probably abuses his own authority over family business. But once Connie made up her mind and got married to Carlo anyway, Vito decided to allow the abuse as a means of saying \"I told you so\" about Carlo being abusive and violent. Another aspect of the novel, that's not very well-explained in the film, is that Carlo is deeply and angrily resentful that he wasn't given a higher post in the Corleone family, e.g., a lieutenant's rank like Clemenza or Tessio. Instead, Vito gives Carlo charge of a family gambling office on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Carlo is given a \"living\", a fine apartment, possessions, and money, but he's not allowed any more than that. In the novel, only after Michael starts to take over the family does Carlo get a better position. Carlo's bad habits of battering Connie and cheating on her ultimately diminish into almost nothing.",
            "Although the film makes this pretty obvious, it still gets asked a lot. Vito asks Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto) to patch up Sonny's dead body so that he looks presentable for his mother at his funeral. Sonny's body was probably shot up so badly by the Barzini hitters (and kicked in the face) as an insult to the Don so they couldn't have an open casket at the funeral. Given how many shots were pumped into Sonny with Thompson machine guns, it must have been an incredibly difficult process for Bonasera, which is why the Don says, \"I want you to use all your powers and all your skills...\" Also, such a job probably would have cost the Don tens of thousands of dollars, even at that time, and Bonasera's \"favor\" must have also included waiving his fee or at least reducing it greatly. The condition of Sonny's body after the assassination is much more graphically explained in the novel-Sonny's face was purposefully shot up heavily so that it would be unrecognizable.",
            "After the meeting of the Five Families, Vito expresses to Tom his conviction that the Barzini family is running the narcotics operation and that they were behind Sonny's death, Tattaglia being too much of a \"pimp\" to \"outfight\" Santino during the Five Families War. During the meeting, it is Barzini who repeatedly reprimands Vito for refusing to share his police and political protection to the drug operation. Vito figures he would only be taking offense so strongly if he were the man behind the operation.",
            "From the beginning, Carlo was never a trusted member of The Family, as evidenced by his low position as bookmaker (aka: \"bookie\", i.e., running a gambling office and not being given a higher post in the family's crime dealings) and Vito's instructions to Tom to allow Carlo to earn a living but to never discuss Family business in front of him. Carlo is a cowardly thug who knows that he is not valued by Don Corleone, but he cannot take his frustrations out on Vito, Sonny, or any of the other high-ranking members of the Family, so he does the next best thing - he is abusive toward Connie. Carlo's treatment of his wife leads to further distrust by Don Corleone. Additionally, it puts strain on his relationship with Sonny -- though the relationship isn't fully explained in the movie, in the novel we learn that Sonny and Carlo have been lifelong friends. When Sonny confronts Carlo about abusing Connie, Carlo instead flees and Sonny brutally beats him up on the street in his own neighborhood in front of Carlo's own men and several witnesses. In the scene, Carlo is clearly displayed as a coward since he makes no attempt to fight Sonny or hit him back. After Sonny beats him up, Carlo feels completely humiliated and seeks vengeance against Sonny. When Barzini (apparently hearing about the incident) asks for his help in setting up Sonny, Carlo is more than happy to comply.Vito himself likely suspected Carlo's role in Sonny's murder, but since he could not prove it (and he didn't want to tip his hand so early), he pretends not to know. Connie, being the youngest child of Vito, had been spoiled and doted upon all her life and Vito doesn't want to see her widowed during his lifetime, something that, despite how horribly Carlo treats her, would upset Connie greatly and make her resent him. A little later, Michael is informed of the sequence of events that took place on the day of Sonny's murder by Vito, Tom, Connie and others which as follows:A mystery woman phones Connie and Carlo at his home. The very pregnant and emotional Connie gets angry and starts to throw a tantrum giving Carlo an \"excuse\" to beat his wife knowing full well that she will call Sonny and tell him that Carlo has beaten her again. It is possible that Carlo may have somehow phoned the Barzini people to inform them that Sonny is on his way to the city, thus giving them the opportunity to ambush and kill him at the toll booth on the Causeway. It's all a little too convenient, and yet Michael still cannot be 100% certain that Carlo was involved in Sonny's murder.When Michael sits down with Carlo in the final scenes of the movie, he needs to know without a doubt that Carlo was responsible before giving the go-ahead. He decides to bluff to get the frightened and cowardly Carlo to admit to his role in Sonny's assassination. It works, and once Michael has confirmation that he has good reason to make his sister a widow, he gives the order to kill Carlo. Carlo's position as son-in-law was the only thing that allowed him to live as long as he did. When Connie finds out her husband is dead, she hysterically says to Michael, \"you waited until Papa died so no one could stop you, and you killed him!\" Had Carlo been anyone else in ranking, he would have been taken out right after Sonny's murder.",
            "It is more apparent in The Godfather Saga as there is additional footage shown pertaining to this. However, Paulie (John Martino) calls out sick on that day, forcing the semi-incompetent Fredo to drive Vito and knowing that Fredo is incapable of defending Vito during the hit. Similar to the Carlo situation, it's just too convenient that Paulie was out sick on the day of the hit; therefore, they got rid of him. In the book, the Corleones have a contact at the phone company that gives them a log of calls by Paulie and Clemenza (Richard S. Castellano), who was also a suspect. By these, they figure out that Paulie was the traitor. In the film, while we now know for certain that Paulie did in fact betray the family, in the original cut of the film, Sonny gives the order to eliminate Paulie without any hesitation or concrete evidence. This could have been meant as a foreshadowing of Sonny's reign as Don; it shows that he'd rather just act on impulse and have a member of his crew killed without any concrete evidence that he did betray them.",
            "Technically, no. Vito's goal in bringing the Commission together is to bring an end to the war in the hope of allowing Michael to return safely to America. Sonny has just been brutally murdered, and the war has gone on long enough, with heavy losses on both sides, both in resources and personnel. Despite their differences, the other men in The Commission know Don Corleone to be a man of his word, so when he swears that he will not seek vengeance for Sonny's death in the interest of ending the violence, the other heads of the Families believe that they will be safe from any acts of vengeance under Don Corleone's orders. However interested he may be in restoring the peace, Vito is hardly a pushover, so it is somewhat puzzling to Tom Hagen (and the audience) why Vito would be so quick to roll over and promise to not seek vengeance in the murder of his eldest son. However, if you listen carefully to the words Vito chooses, he says: \"But that aside, let me say that I swear, on the souls of my grandchildren, that I will not be the one to break the peace we have made here today.\" In that speech, Vito is only making promises about his own actions, but he says nothing about his successor (Michael) being able to seek revenge later on. When Michael returns from Sicily, he immediately begins learning the ropes from Don Vito, in preparation for the day when Vito would retire or die, and Michael would take over as head of The Family. This is specifically addressed in a deleted scene. Michael and Vito are talking in the garden after Michael has taken over as the Don, and Michael says \"You gave your word that you wouldn't break the peace. I didn't give mine. You don't have to have any part. I take all responsibility.\" Vito smiles and responds, \"We have a lot of time to talk about it now\", showing that this is what he had always hoped Michael would do.",
            "There are many events in this film that cause him to take such a turn, the first being that he felt he was forced to join the family in order to help keep his father from being killed, e.g., the incident at the hospital. Also he committed two acts of cold-blooded murder (Virgil Sollozzo and Captain McCluskey (Sterling Hayden)), because he felt he was the only one who could get close enough to those two men -- remember, Michael specifically says \"Sollozzo's gonna kill Pop\". Then he had to spend about a year hiding out in Italy and leave the woman he loved, Kay, behind with no explanation or chance to say goodbye to her. In the novel, Puzo makes mention of the boredom that Michael feels at having to wander Sicily. He learns much about the Mafia and its traditions as well as the frame of mind of men like his father. This is probably the point at which he turned into the Don he would become. He meets and falls in love with a young beautiful Sicilian woman, Apollonia. Shortly after they're married, they plan to move back to America. However, one of Michael's trusted bodyguards betrays him and places a bomb in a car that explodes and kills Apollonia causing Michael to close off his emotions from his business. In turn, this let him become a much more calculated and ruthless Don.",
            "Yes, but the scene didn't make it into the final version of the film. There's a deleted scene in the DVD extras that shows Fabrizio (Angelo Infanti) getting into a car outside a restaurant. The car explodes an instant later. In the novel, the scene is much different. Fabrizio is found working in a pizzeria in Buffalo, New York and is shot by a Corleone operative. The killer indentifies Fabrizio by an elaborate tattoo he had on his chest.",
            "While Michael is attending the baptism of his godchild, Carlo and Connie's new son, each of the Dons of the other leading Families in New York plus Moe Greene (Alex Rocco) in Las Vegas are murdered by Corleone assassins. Following the baptism, Michael ties up the rest of loose family business. First, he has Sal Tessio (Abe Vigoda) escorted away, presumably to be killed. He visits Carlo, having learned of his involvement in Sonny's murder, and gives him a plane ticket to Vegas. When Carlo gets into the car for his trip to the airport, he is garroted from behind. Michael goes home, where he is confronted by an hysterical Connie, who has figured out that it was Michael who ordered the assassination of Carlo. Kay (Diane Keaton) asks Michael if it's true, but he denies it. When Kay leaves the room to fix some tea, three of Michael's capos enter. One of them kisses Michael's hand and calls him 'Don Corleone.' Kay realizes then that Michael has become the new Don.",
            "Actually, he's quite the opposite. In the books, Sonny is described as being a kind and loving man to both his wife and children. Although he is most certainly a bad Don (something that his own father, even after Sonny's death, couldn't deny) he is a wonderful father and husband. His infamous temper is never taken out on his children or wife; Sonny is described as never being able to bring himself to hurt something helpless, especially women and children. As for his infidelity with Lucy Mancini, there's an explanation for that in the book as well. In a highly unusual turn of events, Sonny's wife, Sandra, is well aware that Sonny sleeps with other women and actually prefers it that way. It is described in the book that Sonny Corleone has an abnormally large penis, so large that it actually gives his wife stomachaches. Lucy Mancini, who it turns out has a congenitally loose vagina, is able to deal with the size of Sonny's penis and thus they start an affair. Their affair, however, is purely sexual: Lucy doesn't love Sonny and barely knows him outside of their affair, and Sonny is purely in love with only his wife. This is slightly alluded to in the film. During the wedding at the beginning, Sonny's wife is talking with other women at the table and she holds her hands up in a \"this big\" pose and gradually holds her hands out wider and wider, much to the amazement of the other women. She turns to Sonny, but sees that he's gone and a slight look of hurt and/or despair crosses her face. The scene then cuts to Sonny having sex with Lucy. Lucy has a much larger role in the novel, mostly due to an entire subplot, including several main characters not found in the film, including a plastic surgeon, who \"repairs\" her large vagina, his and Lucy's back-stories, plus their eventual involvement after her affair with Sonny ends (due to his death). This subplot has little to do with the main story of Vito and Michael, and so it was easily excised for the screen version.",
            "There are probably many differing reasons for Michael's actions. Here are a few ideas:1. Michael was planning the massacre of the other heads of the New York crime families & Tom might have tried to talk him out of it. The war between the Five Families had been over for a few years and peace had generally been reigning for about that long & Tom might have tried to convince Michael not to commit any more violence. When the big meeting takes place between Michael, Clemenza, Tessio, Tom and Carlo where Michael 1st announces his desire to move the Corleone family to a legitimate business status, he talks about \"negotiations being made that are going to answer all of your questions and solve all of your problems\" in answer to Tessio's and Clemenza's frustration over Barzini moving in on their respective territories in New York. Those plans likely included the massacre. During the meeting the Don tells Tom, \"... there are reasons why you must have nothing to do with what's going to happen\", referring to the massacre that Michael was plotting to make the Corleone family the most powerful crime organization in New York again.2. Michael and Vito might have placed some of the blame for Sonny's assassination on Tom. Though it turns out that Carlo Rizzi plotted with Barzini to set Sonny up, Michael and Vito probably believed that Tom didn't do enough to stop Sonny from leaving the safety of the family compound that day to find Carlo. Part of Tom's job as consigliere is not only to advise the Don on strategy and business dealings but also to protect the don, especially during times of inter-family war. Think of Tom as the US President's chief of staff in that regard; a person who acts as both an ambassador to and organizer of the President's top advisers. During the meeting mentioned above the Don tells Tom, \"I advised Michael\" (on Tom's ouster), and further says, \"I never thought you were a bad consigliere. I thought Santino was a bad Don, rest in peace.\"3. Michael also says, \"you're not a wartime consigliere, Tom.\" The Don had convinced Michael that Tom wasn't up to the task of being consigliere anymore, especially when the tide was going to turn toward further acts of violence. Instead, Michael goes along with the idea of having his own father be his consigliere because Vito had reigned over the family during previous conflicts with their enemies/rivals. Though Vito dies before the massacre takes place, he was alive long enough to help Michael plan it. Tom wouldn't have wanted to take this course of action & would likely offer poor advice or have tried to stop it. Tom had the ability to advise the Don on what business dealings to secure, but violence wasn't his thing, at least in the later years of his being consigliere.4. Tom was also the Family's attorney, and would be key to the legitimate operations in Nevada. As such, Michael wanted Tom to have plausible deniability regarding any involvement in the mass killing he and Vito were planning. As Vito says, \"there are reasons why you must have no part in what is going to happen. Tom's ouster was a favor, not an insult, though Tom still found it very disappointing to lose such an important position, especially after years of loyal service."

            "It is implied that her eyes change color only when the demonic spirit takes full control of her body, at full-time, giving her that gruesome face and voice.\nIf we analyze the movie, it is quite possible that Regan started being possessed in the early stages of the movie, even when she appeared to be quite normal. This is even clearer in the scene when she shows up in her mother's bed claiming that she couldn't sleep, because her bed was (already) shaking. If what she said is true, then the demonic entity was already surrounding her, trying to manifest itself, at the very least. Then, as the movie progresses, there are key scenes where the demonic presence manifests more and more visibly in her body, for some moments. But, it is presumable that it takes time to take full control of her body, because, we clearly see her trying to fight back just before the demon fully emerges in some of these scenes. As things get more and more serious, Regan may have reached this point where she no longer has the strength to fight back such evil presence anymore. That's when, most likely, the demon wins and takes full control of Regan's body. And that is when we see that horrid face with those yellow eyes.",

In a real-world situation, Kinderman would well be within his rights to arrest or at least detain everyone in the house on suspicion of murder until a full investigation could be completed.

According to director William Friedkin's commentary on the DVD/Blu-ray editions of the movie, Merrin realizes that the presence of these two objects cannot be coincidence, and sees this as a direct omen, an 'announcement' that the demon will again manifest itself and that he will need to face it again.

            "The \"spiderwalk\" was a scene originally intended to be in the film. It showed Regan walking backwards down the stairs of the family home like a spider. The scene was supposed to be immediately after Chris receives word that Burke Dennings (Jack MacGowran) is dead. Director William Friedkin felt that the message about Dennings was the climax of the scene, and therefore it would be difficult to add in the spider walk as this would create a double climax. Friedkin never filmed any reaction shots from Chris and her personal assistant Sharon (Kitty Winn), both of whom were in the hall as Regan came down the stairs. The scene was eventually inserted back into the film for the Extended Director's Cut. The inclusion of the scene was not unanimously supported by the film's fans, some of whom pointed out that this is the only time that the possessed Regan comes out of her bedroom. Regan's confinement allows the viewer to concentrate on dialogue and action outside the room without wondering whether she will emerge and attack someone. Friedkin also planned for a scene showing a possessed Regan crawling over the living room floor, thereby terribly upsetting several house guests with her obscene tongue gestures; the scene was cut because the original negative was lost. The inclusion of the spider walk scene, for better or worse, establishes that she can and will emerge from the bedroom at any point. It is also one of only two concrete \"explanations\" as to why Regan spends the rest of the movie physically restrained."

            "Why do Gondorff and Hooker fake their deaths?"
        ],
        "answers": [
            "For the 1930's most FBI special agents dressed in a suit, tie and hat. Usually a fedora or yes occasionally a straw boater if it went well with their clothing. As to why they are all wearing straw boaters in the film was likely a choice by director George Roy Hill to make them stand out, and group them together and let the audience know these were not just ordinary men or police officers.It is also relieved at the end of the film that the FBI agents are not real FBI agents, but in fact members of a con led by Special Agent Polk (who's real name is revealed as Hickey by Henry Gondorff). Henceforth in the film world, the suits were picked up or stolen and they all came with matching suits and hats due not only to the budget, but how they could convince Lonnegan and Snyder that the deal was real and that they were there to bust a illegal track betting parlor. It should also be noted that Gondorff is wanted by the FBI and having the FBI bust them would make sense since to both Lonnegan and Snyder and with Polk being in charge, it would be easier for him to control Snyder due to chain of command. So likely everyone dresses the same to look formal and stand out amongst the large crowd in the place.",
            "As the con comes to it's close and Doyle Lonnegan bets $500,000 on a horse named Lucky Dan to win. When he learns that the horse is gonna come in second and he would loose his money. He demands his money back at which moment the FBI agents led by Agent Polk and Snyder bust the place and begin to search everyone. Then Polk prepares to take Henry Gondorff into custody and lets Johnny Hooker go. Since part of the set-up is to make it look as though Hooker betrayed Gondorff. Gondorff then shoots Hooker forcing Polk to use deadly force to shoot down Gondorff. Thus the two men are supposably dead. Then Snyder and Lonnegan leave and both men get up unharmed and all is revealed to be fake.The reason they did it this way rather than just leave and leave Lonnegan clueless is because Doyle Lonnegan is a gangster who is very prideful in his money. Whenever his pride is hurt or someone double-crosses him he resorts to murdering the people responsible. He already wanted Hooker dead (however he likely dosen't know Mr. Kelly is really Hooker). Also when he figures. out that he was coned which is highly likely due to how passionate he was about getting his money. He will want Gondorff and Hooker killed and won't rest until they are both dead. By faking their death's it will convince Lonnegan that they are dead, and thus won't go for revenge against the two. It is uncertain if he would go after everyone involved since it would be hard to track them down and would create a bigger mess. Henceforth he usually goes for the main people responsible.Another reason would be so Lt. Snyder (who takes bribes from Hooker to keep quiet). Would stop hunting for Hooker since Hooker cheated him by paying him $2,000 in counterfeit. Snyder then goes on a revenge mission to get Hooker and bring him to his so called justice by turning him into Lonnegan. If they got Hooker it would make it easier for him to get Gondorff since he is wanted by the FBI. Henceforth with both dead he would stop pegging Hooker for the money and Gondorff would remain free.Faking their deaths was the only way to make sure they kept the money, and avoid any reprisal from Lonnegan and get Snyder off everyone's back. While it seems like going very far and very illegal, it was the only way to ensure the con worked and they got even."

            "Cross hired her to lie about seeking the details of an affair; he wanted to get to his hidden and protected granddaughter to abuse her as he'd abused Evelyn years earlier. Gittes was fooled into believing it.She was hired by Noah Cross or some of Cross' people to expose Hollis Mulwray's affair with Katherine. The woman who impersonated Evelyn was named Ida Sessions. She meets with Jake, tells him that her husband is having an affair and wants Jake to get proof. Cross' plan was to scandalize his business partner in the news perhaps to force his hand in allowing the dam that Hollis refuses to build. (A previous damming project Hollis had overseen had failed and caused a number of deaths.) Cross wanted the dam built so he could open up a large swath of land for a lucrative housing deal.",
            "Hollis had previously overseen the building of another dam that had failed, causing the deaths of a number of people downstream. Hollis says very specifically at the public forum that the rock at the proposed site of the new dam is the same kind of rock from the previous damming project. That rock is too weak to handle the pressure that would be created by the proposed dam. He simply refuses to make the same mistake again.What makes his refusal complicated is that the farmers in the area where the newer damn would be built are losing crops and livestock because of the drought LA is experiencing and because of Noah Cross' efforts to choke off the water supply. Cross wants to force the farmers in the area to sell their land to him cheaply so he can re-irrigate the land and turn it into prime real estate. Such a project would make hundreds of millions of dollars for Cross, perhaps even more in the future.The politics of the situation also come into play: Hollis is arguing his refusal at a public forum with city councilmen and perhaps other politicians involved, all of whom want the project to go forward. They probably stand to make millions from it, make millions for the city of Los Angeles and can ensure their re-elections in the future.",
            "No one has answered this question yet.",
            "No. He was involved in protecting her and hiding her from her pervert grandfather. This is why Cross made up the lie to get Gittes to follow Mulwray on a false matrimonial claim. \"Find the girl\"I dont think so. Not sure. I think that Mulray was just seeing his wife's daughter, making sure she was ok, and kept away from the father Noah Cross. I may be wrong, but I dont see an affair here. just visiting a vulnerable young woman.",
            "Noah's scheme really breaks down into two different schemes:1. He was surreptitiously buying up desert land in the San Fernando Valley, which was at the time farmland. It is now suburbs, and home to nearly 2 million people. Noah was denying water to the farmers (and sending out thugs that worked for him to terrorize them: poisoning their wells, blowing up their water tanks, like the old farmer claims) to encourage or coerce them to sell their land, then using the identities of the residents of the retirement home to purchase land at a discount. He would then use his influence and knowledge of the water system to ensure the land would be provided with a supply of fresh water for future residents. Noah and his descendants would be rich. Hollis Mulwray, Cross' old business partner, did a lot of investigation on his own and was close to discovering the full extent of Noah's scheme. Noah knew about it and had him murdered.2. Cross was also trying to find his granddaughter, Katherine Mulwray, who was the progeny of an incestuous affair Noah had with his daughter, Evelyn. While the real reason for Cross' plans for his granddaughter is not state specifically, he does say at one point that he's \"only got one daughter left\" and \"she's mine too\" in his last scene with Evelyn. It's left up to the viewer to decide what Cross actually has in mind when he takes Katherine for himself in the last scene. That Noah ends up with custody of Katherine is an unsettling outcome."

When it comes time to say hello to Johnny Ola, Fredo freezes up and turns away from him. Michael then introduces Johnny to Fredo, and they act like it's the first time they met. But it was tense and awkward. Michael notices this, but likely dismisses it.\nThen, while out partying with the group, Senator Geary asks how Fredo found out about the club they were in. Fredo, likely drunk, says that Johnny Ola took him there. Michael hears this and now knows that Fredo has been working with his enemies.",

            "It's more likely that they were standing guard and simply caught Michael's bodyguard in the act. It's likely that Roth anticipated a hit as well and so asked them to guard his room.",
            "The flashback scene is significant for several reasons.For one thing, consider the fact that it takes place immediately after the hit against Fredo is carried out. By having his own brother killed, not to mention the emotional war he has waged against Kay, Michael has become completely corrupted by his role as the Don. The flashback shows that Michael had plans and tried to take control of his own destiny by joining the Marines despite the protests of Sonny and Tom (and, as it's implied, Vito) before he was inevitably drawn in to the Mafia life, which has now fully consumed him. Michael carrying out the murder of his brother also carries additional weight: in the flashback, Fredo is the only one who is supportive of Michael's plans.The scene is also one final indicator of Vito's impact throughout the events of the film series, even though he doesn't physically appear in the scene: Michael notes that Sonny is speaking like Vito while Tom mentions that he and Vito have had conversations about Michael's future. Despite Michael's best-laid plans, he still entered the family business, much like Vito had intended, as implied through the discussions that Tom mentioned.As for why Michael looks older in the final scene, part of the reason for that is that the lightning is made to showcase just how much the duties of the Don have eaten away at his youthfulness, as several wrinkles can be seen under his eyes. Additionally, some believe that the scene is meant to take place in the future and that Michael is picturing a time he can never get back or that he is reflecting on how he tried to separate himself from the rest of his family (evidenced by the fact that he remains behind in the dining room while everyone else goes to greet Vito) but was inevitably drawn into their business, losing several of them permanently in the process.",
            "No. Even at that age, young Vito was intelligent and knew that having loose lips got his father and his brother killed. He kept his mouth shut to stay alive. Vito's mother was also saying he was slow-witted to downplay Vito's intelligence and therefore his potential threat to Don Ciccio, in the hope that the Don would be merciful.",
            "The senate did question this. Once Pantangeli started claiming he had no idea who Michael was or of any criminal activities, they immediately question who the man sitting next to Michael and Tom was. Tom explains that this was the brother of Frankie. They ask if he would approach and be sworn in. Tom states that the brother didn't speak English and was simply there in support of his brother.",
            "Michael was leaving Tom in charge of family affairs while Michael focused on the business in Cuba and Vegas, essentially letting Tom handle the day-to-day.",
            "If you refer to the beginning of the film where Connie (with boyfriend/fiance) tells Michael they're going to Vegas to get married, Michael (opposed to idea) asks why they came to him. Connie replies that she needs money. It's safe to say any objections Connie has to Michael's ways and doings are easily solved by her need for financial support. Also, with enough time passing, Connie's anger towards Michael may have faded. As she says at the end, \"I hated you for so many years. I think that I did things to myself; to hurt myself. So you'd know that I could hurt you. But you were just being strong for us. Like papa was. And I forgive you.\".",
            "Michael knew from the start that it was Hyman Roth that tried to have him killed. Michael went to Roth, saying that he knows Frankie tried to have him killed because Michael tried to have him make a deal with the Rosato brothers. Michael asks if Roth would object to him having Frankie killed. Hyman Roth agrees to the hit.This was done by Michael to give Roth a sense of security and superiority that Michael was wrong about who ordered the hit. Michael then goes to Frankie to reveal that he knows it was actually Roth behind the hit. Michael asks Frankie to make peace with the Rosatos to bide their time. Much like in the first film, Michael orders Tessio and Clemenza to show no resistance to Barzini muscling in on their turf, until the time is right.Johnny Ola then calls Fredo to try and find out if Frankie was genuine in his wanting of peace (given how outspoken Frankie was about wanting the Rosatos dead). Fredo refused to give any information, as he didn't know anyway. So Roth decided to stage an attempted hit on Frankie to further hinder Michael's plans.",
            "Remember, Michael Corleone and Hyman Roth behave as friends, but they secretly hate each other. Hyman considers Michael as a threat to his business interests and secretly devises plans to get him out of the way (i.e., dead).As an aside, Hyman Roth and Moe Greene were best friends. Hyman Roth suspects Michael ordered the hit on Moe Greene (in The Godfather, Part I), and he resents Michael for the hit (another reason to get rid of Michael).Hyman Roth is secure in his and Michael's friendship, until Michael asks him about the hit on Pentangeli. He is caught off guard and realizes that Michael suspects him. At that point, Hyman Roth drops his friendly demeanor and chastises Michael by warning him not to ask who gave the order. Their mutual disdain for each other is now in the open.In reality, Hyman Roth ordered the Rosato brothers to hit Pentangeli and probably knew what happened. After Michael asked him about the hit, he realizes that Michael knows what happened as well.",
            "When Vito arrived at Ellis Island in New York City in 1901, he was asked for his name. Vito, perhaps still in shock from the murder of his father, brother and mother back in Sicily, didn't speak much in his childhood so he did not reply, so an interpreter checked his immigration papers and found that his name was Vito Andolini from Corleone, Sicily. Consequently, the immigration inspector (a foreigner himself) gave him entry into the U.S. as Vito Corleone.",
            "It may have been implied that Fredo betrayed Michael by opening the bedroom drapes to give Johnny Ola's (Dominic Chianese) hitmen a better view into the room. It's been suggested that once Fredo realized that the hitman had attempted to kill Michael and Kay, Fredo killed the gunmen. (According to Fredo's wife, their bodies were found right outside her and Fredo's room.) This is unlikely because Fredo seemed completely unaware of the situation. Fredo later explains to Michael that Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg) and Ola had assured him it was not going to be an actual hit, just a ruse to frighten Michael into being more cooperative in his business negotiations. That much is probably true, although Fredo also makes it clear that he relished the opportunity to operate on his own, independent of Michael. To Michael, Fredo's act of betrayal is straightforwardly unforgivable, regardless of motive and regardless of whether Fredo had been deceived.It's most likely that Johnny Ola killed the men himself. We know he was in town, as he met with Michael earlier in the day. He then sent the two men to try and kill Michael while he waited for them at the storm drain. Once they met him there, he killed them both and snuck out. Fredo may have shown them a way to get in to the compound undetected and opened the drapes, but his involvement likely ended there.",
            "Al Neri (Richard Bright). As Hagen arrives to talk with Senator Pat Geary (G.D. Spradlin) to explain his situation, Neri appears in the doorway and Hagen beckons with his head for him to go away. This is corroborated on the bonus disc of the newly-restored Godfather release on Blu-ray/DVD, where a \"Crime Organization Chart\" is given explaining all characters and their crimes. Under Neri, it states that he killed the prostitute that was with Senator Pat Geary. It is also confirmed by Coppola himself during the director's commentary track on the DVD. Coppola had previously received much criticism for allegedly \"glorifying the mafia\". On the commentary, he mentions that the scene with the dead prostitute is to remind the audience that members of the Cosa Nostra are as ruthless as they are honorable. It shows that they would not hesitate to have Neri kill an innocent girl just to put pressure on a senator.",
            "There are several possible reasons. Though not explicitly stated, it is implied that Roth wanted revenge for the death of Moe Greene (Alex Rocco), a friend of his who was assassinated on Michael's orders in the previous film. He is visibly angry with Michael when they are discussing Greene. A second reason might be that Michael is getting too much power and influence at the expense of other powerful mobsters, including Roth himself, so they try to kill him. When that fails, Roth tries to cripple Michael's business through Pentangeli's testimony at the senate hearing. Finally, Michael is reluctant to invest in Roth's Cuban business, whereas Fredo seems much more interested. Just as in the first film, killing the Don or otherwise removing him from his seat of power, will make his next in line Don (in this case, Fredo) who seems much more inclined to continue business with Roth and who can be easily controlled and manipulated.",
            "Probably just to see if he could. Vito eventually turns out as the head of his own crime organization, because he is the one who realizes that power cannot only be based on violence alone; it depends as much on persuasion, gaining respect and loyalty. He knew that Fanucci's (Gastone Moschin) reign was primarily based on bluffs and intimidation, rather than a large, strong organisation backing him (there was even a deleted scene showing Fanucci getting attacked and wounded by a group of street kids, which showed how weak Fanucci actually was). Killing Fanucci would solve most of his problems, but it would be the easy way out. Vito wants to see if he can bargain with Fanucci, and persuade him to cut down on his demands. In other words: he does not simply want to give in to Fanucci's intimidation tactics, but prove that he dares to stand up to him from a vulnerable position. The tactic works, as Fanucci respects Vito's candor and boldness. It also has the advantage of giving Fanucci a false sense of security, making it easier to catch the Don off guard for the assassination. In case there would have been a police investigation, Vito could easily claim (and the people present in the restaurant could be witnesses) that he and Fanucci had a truce and, therefore, had no motive to kill him. Since the murder was committed during the fireworks ceremony and Vito had properly disposed of the gun, there would be no way that he would have been caught.",
            "To act as a primitive suppressor (silencer) and to conceal it so he could take his time and aim, which is why Fanucci asks, \"What have you got there?\" If he had seen a gun in Vito's hand, he likely would have shut the door and ran.",
            "Honor is the principle of this subject. Roth betrayed Michael and therefore must die by the hand of the Corleone family. If Roth died of natural causes then he would have won/gotten away with it. Michael also seems to doubt that Roth is truly dying: as they plan the hit, he says \"He's been dying of the same heart attack for 20 years.\".\nAs we see in the flashback with Vito, he goes to confront Don Ciccio, who killed Vito's entire family. Ciccio was a frail, doddering old man who no longer posed any threat, but he had to die by Vito's hand for his actions against the Andolini family.",
            "First, the code of \"omerta\". The code originated in Sicily, long invaded and ill-treated by foreign governments, and states that one should never, no matter how they or their families are harmed, go to the authorities. Avenging the harm done was instead in the hands of the offended. Violation of this was considered the ultimate form of disgrace. This belief had much to do with the formation of the mafia and its ultimate growth and staying power. Michael brought Frank Pentangeli's older brother Vincenzo (Salvatore Po) from Sicily. It showed to Frank that his testimony to the Committee would be heard by his brother and family, disgracing him and his family. Thus, he changed his story, refusing not only to implicate Michael, but anyone.There are two theories as to why Frank did this. The first is that having Frank's brother show up at the hearing with Michael was a veiled threat that insinuated the brother would be killed as a result of the testimony. Frank assumed his brother would be safe seeing as he was a lonesome shepherd in Sicily with no ties to the mob. Michael was showing him this wouldn't be the case. A second theory is that Vincenzo is a powerful Mafia chieftain in Sicily. Frank tells Hagen afterwards that Vincenzo is \"ten times tougher\" than himself, that he's \"old fashioned\" and that he could have had his own crime family if he moved to America. Vincenzo's icy stare at his brother during the testimony was a threat that Frank's family would be killed if he testified. In an early draft of the script, it was mentioned that Frank had a mistress and child in Sicily under the care of Vincenzo, but he would kill them should Frank testify against Michael. Michael tells Kay afterwards that what happened at the hearing was a personal matter between the brothers.",
            "The movie ends in a montage that shows the sequence of events following Mama Corleone's funeral. (1) Roth returns from Israel and is taken into custody by the police. Rocco Lampone (Tom Rosqui) shoots Roth dead. In turn, Rocco is shot dead by the police while trying to escape. (2) Frank Pentangeli is found dead in his bathtub, having slit his wrists. (3) Neri, Fredo, and Anthony are about to go fishing when Michael calls Anthony back, leaving Neri and Fredo to go out alone. As Fredo says a \"Hail Mary\", Neri shoots him in the head when he gets to the part about \"pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of death.\" The final montage has Michael reflecting back to 1941 as the four Corleone children plus Hagen are planning a birthday party for their father. Sonny (James Caan) introduces Connie (Talia Shire) to her future husband Carlo Rizzi (Gianni Russo). Michael announces that, following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, he has joined the Marines, shocking everyone, especially after the strings Vito had to pull to get him a draft deferment. Vito then arrives and everyone except Michael rushes off to greet him. In the final scene, Michael sits alone in the family garden at Lake Tahoe.",
            "Though the film itself doesn't provide a definitive answer, the video game adaptation posits that a Corleone hit squad (led by the player character) invades the Rosato estate and kills both brothers. Given Michael's low tolerance for treachery, it is highly probable that something along those lines did indeed happen to them.",
            "The reason is mainly to keep his honor, and also to be sure that his family will be taken care of. When he collaborates with the FBI telling them about the Corleone family, he also reveals his implications, the crimes he had committed for the family. This confession gives him immunity and allows him to avoid doing time in prison. However, he breaks his agreement with the FBI and denies all he had previously said. The alternative to this honourable death offered by Hagen is, then, to be thrown into jail, probably getting killed there. His widow would have to move out of the Corleone house and find someplace to live, while Frankie's kids would be shamed as the sons of a traitor, just like his brother Vincenzo. That's why he accepts. Frankie said it himself that his life wasn't worth a nickel.",
            "The whole assassination attempt, including Pentangeli's escape at the end, was planned by Hyman Roth to make Pentangelli believe Michael wanted him dead so that he would turn against him and collaborate with the FBI in the Congressional investigation. Keep in mind that Michael figured out that the attempt on his life at his home was orchestrated by Hyman Roth. But when he talks about this with Roth, he says that he believes it was Pentangelli. Michael then asks Roth if he'd be upset if he had Frankie killed. Roth simply replies with \"He's small potatoes\", i.e. insignificant in the plot. Michael then goes to see Frankie and reveals that he knows it was Roth who betrayed him. Roth either figured this out or planned to make the false attempt on Frankie and use Michael's name before Michael could make the \"actual\" attempt.",
            "Viewers are split on whether or not Fredo knew he was going to be killed. Some viewers point out that Fredo was always shown to be naive, scared and weak. When Michael confronted Fredo in Cuba, he ran away and went into hiding. It was only upon promise he wouldn't be harmed that he agreed to sit down with Michael and tell him what happened. Even though at the end, Michael pretended to forgive Fredo, if Michael suggested that Fredo go fishing alone with Al Neri, Michael's personal hitman; Fredo likely would have been suspicious and not have gone along with it and gone back into hiding. It was only because Fredo and Neri were supposed to go out fishing with Michael's son, but at the last minute, he was called back. So Fredo thought he was safe. Others point out that, when Michael told Anthony at the last minute that they were leaving, Fredo was left in the boat with Al Neri. Fredo had thought he was safe when Michael said that he forgave him. However, Michael had a history of \"forgiving\" people (such as Carlo) so that they would stay close, giving him an opportunity to kill them. Once he realized he was going out on the lake with the family's most trusted killer, Fredo probably realized he was going to be whacked and accepted his fate."

            "Yes.Important to note is that although the impact on the story if this plot point were removed is minimal, it is used to reinforce a good point. Sonny wants to kid himself that he is a good guy, but he is in reality an idiotic no-hoper who lacks even rudimentary insight.Not widely known even amongst sufferers of diabetes is that heat is detrimental to diabetes care. Temperatures of twenty-six degrees celsius and up will put upward pressure on the blood glucose. For American audiences, that is 78.8 farenheit. With the police having shut off the light and air conditioning in the bank, anyone who suffers from diabetes and does not have access to insulin would be very sick after a couple of hours.Regarding the question of diabetes types and how they would affect the situation, there are a couple of possibilities to explain the situation in the film. In the first scenario, the bank manager has had diabetes for a long time and his blood glucose is consequently more unstable. Diabetes is a degenerative disease and gets harder to control the longer one has it.The second possibility is that our bank manager had type two diabetes and his digestive system has given up the ghost. People in this situation frequently have difficulties with adjusting to the different treatment and the extent to which blood glucose problems happen more quickly.As the point of this sequence is simply to further illustrate the idiocy and self-delusion of Sonny, the golden rule is to focus on the disease as much as is needed to illustrate the point and no more. The film does this, and does it well."

            "While there is no official explanation for Quint smashing the boat radio, fans have come up with two possible explanations.A. He wants Brody and Hooper to keep their eyes on the prize, so to speak. If they truly can't be helped by those on-shore, all that can be done is to kill the shark themselves.B. Quint, in a prideful fashion, wants to keep the glory and money from killing the shark all to himself or, at the very least, wants as few people as possible to share in the glory/money. The last thing he'd want in that case is for Brody to call in for help.",
            "Presumably he was eaten by the shark, though this occurs offscreen.",
            "The non personal reasons were the following: while Hooper was a special government envoy, due to his expertise, Brody had to make sure Quint did the job for which he was paid",
            "The engine was damaged and the boat was taking on water. Quint may have been acting reckless, but he had done nothing to cause direct bodily harm to Hooper or Brody. It would have been ill-advised to handcuff a man on a sinking boat with a shark stalking them. They still needed Quint's help to try and kill the shark as well. Call it an 'all hands on deck' situation.",
            "Scientifically, no. SCUBA tanks are built and designed so that they would not explode when such pressure is applied. In a special episode of the TV show MythBusters (2003) dedicated to myths of Jaws, it was confirmed that an air tank would never explode like that. It would go flying off like a rocket if hit dead center at the end. If hit off center or in the side, it would spin in circles as it flew away, either of which would still have been fatal for the shark but in a much less spectacular manner. Spielberg decided that the ending would be more uplifting if he went against the logic and made the tank explosive (the film ending is very different from the original novel, where Brody's fight against the shark is of a completely different nature).",
            "Great White Sharks have been confirmed to be able to jump up to 8ft in the air to pursue their prey so it is not unreasonable to expect them to be able to breach Quint's boat.",
            "There are a number of differences between the movie and original novel (from which the feature film was adapted and based upon). Though the general idea is the same, both versions of the tale are completely separate in their portrayal of certain events.In the movie, Brody and Hooper become fast friends and work together side-by-side. In the novel, Hooper is a cocky young rich guy originally from Amity who has an affair with Ellen, Brody's wife. The two become enemies and Brody's battle with growing old and his envy of Hooper is a major sub-plot.In the novel the Brodys have three children: Martin Jr., Billy and Sean. In the film they have two sons, Michael and Sean.In the novel, Hooper is killed by the shark when he goes underneath the water in the cage. In the film, he survives.Quint is not killed by the shark in the same way as he is in the film. In the novel, instead of being eaten by the shark as it rams into the Orca, his foot is caught in a rope attached to the shark, and he is pulled underwater and drowns.Brody does not defeat the shark using a rifle and the air tank as he does in the film. In the book, the Orca sinks, and Brody is left helpless in the water. As the shark swims towards him, he can do nothing but accept his fate. But when it is mere inches away from him, the shark dies, from days and days of battle with the men, presumably mostly due to blood loss and exhaustion from the barrels stuck in it. It is a very anti-climactic, yet still poignant ending.The novel develops the character of Ellen Brody to a greater degree. Whereas the film shows that both Martin and Ellen Brody were from New York and have recently moved to Amity, in the novel Ellen is a former \"summer person\" from a wealthy family who used to vacation on the island, and Martin is a native islander. Although basically content with her marriage, she still yearns for her former life and sees Hooper, whose older brother she used to date, as a reminder of that life which leads to a brief affair with Hooper. She also works as a volunteer at the local Amity hospital.In the novel, Mayor Vaughn's insistence on keeping the beaches open becomes a major plot point. Vaughn owes money to the Mafia; it is explained that Vaughn's wife had an undisclosed illness and that a desperate Vaughn acquired the money for her treatment from a mob-connected loan shark. Despite attempting to pay back the debt, the Mafia refused repayment, instead telling Vaughn that they would inform him when it would come due. Essentially extorting Vaughn, the Mafia then infiltrated the Amity real estate market (Amity newspaper publisher Harry Meadows finds that Vaughn's \"silent partners\" in his real estate firm are mobsters); hence his extreme desire to keep the beaches open, as a depressed real estate market would most likely result in the Mafia calling in his marker and Vaughn having no way to pay it. The movie removes this sub-plot and instead concentrates on the mayor's attempts to keep the beaches open to benefit the local economy.Harry Meadows, owner, editor and publisher of the Amity Gazette has a far more expanded role in the novel. Seen briefly in the film and portrayed mostly as a patsy to Mayor Vaughn and the Town Selectmen, in the novel he acts as Brody's confidante and in fact is the one who digs deep, at Brody's request, to find out why Vaughn is pushing to keep the beaches open. Meadows is able to find documents that show the \"silent partners\" in Vaughn's real estate firm are connected to the mob and that by keeping the beaches open Vaughn is essentially trying to keep himself alive: a depressed economy would destroy Amity's tourist-reliant real estate market and most likely force his partners to call in a debt that Vaughn owed them, a debt that he would have no possible way to pay. Meadows eventually convinces Brody that the chief should keep the beaches open, if not for Vaughn's sake, then because the chances that the shark would attack again are slim to none.Quint hardly speaks at all in the book and he's described rather differently-he's tall and thin with a completely bald head and wears a Marine Corps. cap. The antagonism between him and Hooper, which is used mostly to comic effect in the film, is much more serious in the novel: Hooper, being an ichthyologist & more conservationist about sea life, hates Quint's methods (Quint at one point uses a fetal dolphin to bait the shark). Quint uses any methods to hunt sea life that he chooses and has no qualms about catching or harpooning anything that comes near his boat.There is a higher body-count in the book than in the film as well.The book is much darker in tone. Most of the main characters are much more unhappy or ill-tempered, bordering on unlikable. Martin and Ellen Brody fight quite a lot and Ellen seems impossible to please. Brody is very surly and more confrontational in the book too-at a dinner party thrown by Ellen, he drinks too much and is rude toward his guests. As previously stated, Brody and Hooper become enemies when Brody feels threatened by the younger Hooper. Brody becomes convinced that Hooper has slept with Ellen (he has), and becomes obsessed with finding out what Hooper was doing on the day in question. Brody confronts Hooper before going out to sea and Hooper indirectly implies he slept with Ellen, causing Brody to lose it and nearly chokes Hooper to death while Quint watches rather nonchalantly.",
            "The poison (strychnine nitrate) was in the needle and the sharks hide was too tough for the needle to penetrate as Hooper mentions to Quint who says \"You can get this little needle through his skin?\" to which Hooper responds that he can't, Hooper had to go in the water so that he could get the needle into the shark's mouth, where the flesh was less tough."

            "Michael Myers killed his sister Judith because of a curse that was placed on him by a weirdo doctor who wanted to keep the cult of thorn thriving. The curse made Michael a killing machine who would sacrifice his family members on Halloween night. This is the explanation given in the later sequels of the Halloween franchise, such as Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers (1995).However, in the original film, there is no clear motive for Michael's actions. He is simply portrayed as an evil and psychotic child who randomly snaps and murders his sister with a kitchen knife. John Carpenter wanted to keep Michael's backstory and motivation ambiguous, as he believed that this would make him more terrifying and unpredictable. He also wanted to suggest that Michael was influenced by some supernatural force that made him unstoppable and immortal. This is why he is often referred to as \"the Shape\" in the film, implying that he is not human but a manifestation of pure evil.",
            "The assumption is that, when Laurie dropped off the key to the Myers' house, Michael saw the two of them and associated Laurie with his sister Judith and with Tommy as himself.\nIn the original continuity, it's revealed that Laurie is actually Michael's younger sister, who was adopted by the Strodes. However, that is no longer canon.",
            "After finding the bodies of Annie, Lynda, and Bob (John Michael Graham), Laurie is slashed and chased by Michael. She runs back to the Wallace residence, locks the front door, and sends her charges-Lindsey (Kyle Richards) and Tommy (Brian Andrews)-upstairs to hide. She finds the phone is dead and notices a window open and realizes that Michael is in the house. She hunkers down against the couch and grabs a knitting needle. When Michael suddenly pops up from behind the couch and swipes at her with his knife, she buries the knitting needle in his neck. He pulls out the needle and collapses behind the couch. Laurie goes up stairs and tells Lindsey and Tommy that she's killed him. \"You can't kill the boogeyman,\" Tommy warns. Sure enough, Michael is right behind her bearing his chef's knife. Laurie locks the kids back in Tommy's bedroom, and she tries to hide in a closet. When Michael breaks through the louvered doors, Laurie jabs a clothes hanger into his eye. Michael drops the knife, so Laurie picks it up and plunges it into his gut. Again, Michael falls to the ground. Certain that she's killed him this time, Laurie instructs the kids to run to the McKenzie house and tell them to call the police. Then she collapses against a wall, unaware that Michael has gotten up from the floor, picked up the knife, and is coming at her again. Meanwhile, Dr. Loomis is walking down the street, after having found Michael's car about three blocks away. When he sees Lindsey and Tommy come tearing out the front door, screaming and yelling, he goes inside. He sees Michael trying to choke Laurie. She rips off Michael's mask, forcing Michael to pause to put his mask back on. This gives Loomis an opportunity to fire a bullet into Michael's back. When it doesn't seem to faze Michael, Loomis blasts five more bullets into Michael's chest. The force of the shots causes Michael to topple over the porch railing, falling two stories to the ground below. Sobbing, Laurie asks Loomis, \"Was that the boogeyman?\", to which Loomis replies, \"As a matter of fact, it was.\" When Loomis walks out on the porch to look down at Michael's body, he is not surprised to find that it has disappeared.",
            "Yes. At the beginning of the movie Michael's father takes off his mask showing. At the end just before Dr. Loomis shoots Michael, Laurie rips off his mask, showing his face for about four seconds before he puts the mask back on. He looks like a normal man, except for a wound on his left eye (inflicted by Laurie).",
            "In the context of the movie, Michael is seemingly human but there are all of these indications that maybe, just maybe, he is pure evil and inhuman, thus the boogeyman. Director John Carpenter's answer to this is simple. He chose to make Michael a human being in the beginning of the film, and then we slowly start to realize that he's a force of nature that won't stop. Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers provides a retroactive explanation to this question."

They knew that the first man they sent in to kill Kurtz, Colby wound up being brainwashed by Kurtz and joined his cult.",

            "Universally interpreted as by the audience as Willard calling in an airstrike to destroy Kurtz's followers (just as he wished, \"Drop the bomb, exterminate the brutes\"), employing the codeword on the radio he instructed Chef to use in order to do just that. However this was never Coppola's intention and in the redux version the final scene is re-edited to simply show Willard turning off the radio, leaving it ambiguous.",

            "Willard's mission had priority over any other operations the crew of the PBR might have. The mission was to get Willard close to Kurtz' compound and drop him off-though, because of the top secret nature of it, Willard didn't tell Chief Phillips what the parameters were. When Phillips spotted the sampan and stopped it for an inspection, it was a routine action. However, Willard, having been on many secret missions before, objected thinking that it would cause him and the crew trouble, which it did.",
            "The actual fate of the dog that Chef found in the river boat is left ambigous. The most logical explanation is that the dog was knocked off the boat and swam to shore. It's possible that, given the young age of the pup, it was not able to swim. However, most dogs have the instinct within them to know how to swim at least short distances. But its fate is left to the viewer.",
            "There are three possible interpretations, and certainly many more:1. She was hit with several bullets and dying. Willard shot her knowing they'd never get her to a medical facility in time.2. If it was possible for her to live, there are likely not enough provisions (food, water) on the boat for anyone else in addition to the crew. Another movie where this theme is addressed is Das Boot (1981). In that film, after firing torpedoes at a British cargo ship, the U-boat captain leaves the survivors of the British ship in the water even after hearing their cries for help. He knows that a U-Boat simply cannot accommodate prisoners.3. (Most probable) Willard's mission had priority over everything else and he'd warned the Chief of that before they inspected the sampan (\"You wouldn't even be in this part of the river if it weren't for me\"). Through much of the film, Willard and the Chief lock horns over Willard's mission vs the duty of the boat crew, which is a minor theme of the story. Willard's mission does indeed have priority, but the Chief still feels his duty is to the duties set forth by his own superiors, which include patrolling the river for any enemy forces or those suspected of assisting them. Phillips does say very quickly when they see the sampan that boats like these have been supplying the enemy. Willard staunchly disagrees but the Chief still goes ahead with the inspection.Additionally, like Willard says in his voice-over shortly after the sampan incident, \"Those boys were never gonna look at me the same way again.\" It's likely that Willard wanted just that; to make the crew and the Chief realize that Willard is not simply one of them, but a man charged with a top secret mission. To do the job, he has to be a cold-blooded killer and felt the crew needed to know it.",
            "In the film, the photojournalist's ultimate fate is left ambiguous. He is last seen telling Willard that Kurtz has started to go too far and that he is running away. There is a deleted scene available on the Complete Dossier DVD in which the photojournalist tells Willard that he took a picture of Kurtz and that everyone will soon kill him. He is immediately found by Colby and shot.",
            "The exact reasons for Chef's decapitation are never actually made clear. Chef is last seen on the boat either trying to call for an air strike (for the Army to firebomb Kurtz' compound) OR simply conducting a radio test. One explanation could be that Kurtz knew this and killed him to prevent him from succeeding. Note that later on, just before Willard leaves to kill Kurtz, and at the very end, someone can be heard on the radio trying to contact the boat, implying that the previous conversation had been cut off abruptly, most likely because Chef was attacked and killed either by Kurtz himself or a native following his orders. If this was the case, then Kurtz presumably wanted to make an example of Chef, and dropped his head on Willard's lap as a warning. A second interpretation is that Willard finds Kurtz's notebook in which Kurtz wrote a note for Willard that says \"Drop the bomb, kill them all!\" so he killed Chef because he assumed Willard would tell Chef to order the strike if Willard did not return to the boat in a certain amount of time, which would kill Kurtz, Willard, and everyone else. Kurtz wanted to die honorably, hand to hand by a fellow soldier, but a bombing death wouldn't fulfill that wish. Willard even states that he believes this to be the case. A third interpretation is Kurtz wanted to show Willard the face of the horror. A fourth interpretation is that Kurtz heard about Chef's language towards his people and himself, and was offended by it. After all Lance was spared, likely due to him embracing the insanity.",
            "\"The End\" by The Doors. It's from the band's 1st, self-titled album, released in 1967. The song is nearly 12 minutes long. Interestingly, the version heard in the film is the original, uncensored version where Morrison can be heard chanting the word \"fuck\" several times. This original version can be found on Legacy: the Absolute Best compilation. The track is also used at the end during the scene where Willard stalks and kills Kurtz and while the natives sacrifice the cow."

To do this, he creates his imaginary friend, Tony, through whom Danny can rationalize his visions and survive. here[/link]]",
            "References to Native Americans and their culture are dotted throughout the film. For example, Stuart Ullman points out that the hotel is built on the site of an ancient Indian burial ground; Indian motifs and designs decorate the walls of the interior of the hotel; Calumet baking powder cans feature prominently in two pivotal scenes (as Hallorann first shines, asking Danny if he wants some ice-cream, and as Jack asks Grady to let him out of the locked pantry); July 4th is given great significance at the end of the film. These references to Native American culture and history are unique to the film, they are not found in the book, and this has prompted many fans over the years to query their importance. On July 29th, 1987, Bill Blakemore published a short article in the San Francisco Chronicle entitled \"The Family of Man,\" in which he attempted to attribute specific meaning to the Native American references found in the film. Blakemore argued that The Shining is not so much about one man's murderous rampage in an effort to destroy his family, as it is about the murderous rampage of the white man in an effort to destroy the Native American race. In his introductory paragraph, Blakemore very clearly states, The Shining is not really about the murders at the Overlook Hotel. It is about the murder of a race -- the race of Native Americans -- and the consequences of that murder ... it is also explicitly about America's general inability to admit to the gravity of the genocide of the Indians -- or, more exactly, its ability to \"overlook\" that genocide. Blakemore takes a predominantly metaphorical approach to the film, arguing that hidden meaning is to be found beneath the surface, and that that hidden meaning, when discovered in an individual scene or character, can then be applied to the film as a whole. For example, he finds the scene immediately after Jack kills Hallorann as particularly significant in a metaphorical sense. Blakemore argues that the long shot showing the grinning Jack standing over Hallorann's bleeding body, which is lying across a rug decorated with an Indian motif, is a metaphor for the violence perpetrated by white people over black people and Indians in America.Blakemore works to connect different aspects of the film which may not initially seem connected at all. For example, he argues that the reference to Indian burial ground and the river of blood flowing from the elevator are intimately tied together; the first and most frequently seen of the film's very real American \"ghosts\" is the flooding river of blood that wells out of the elevator shaft, which presumably sinks into the Indian burial ground itself. The blood squeezes out in spite of the fact that the red doors are kept firmly shut within their surrounding Indian artwork embellished frames. We never hear the rushing blood. It is a mute nightmare. It is the blood upon which this nation, like most nations, was built, as was the Overlook Hotel.\nLike most viewers, Blakemore also finds the final shot to be greatly significant, and it too contains hidden meaning which informs the film's protest against the violence perpetrated against Native Americans; the master key to unlocking the whole movie, is that most Americans overlook the fact that July Fourth was no ball, nor any kind of Independence day, for Native Americans; that the weak American villain of the film is the re-embodiment of the American men who massacred the Indians in earlier years; that Kubrick is examining and reflecting on a problem that cuts through the decades and centuries. Blakemore concludes his article by extending his argument even further, saying, although Kubrick is protesting against the specific violence experienced by Native Americans, he is also protesting against the general violence experienced by all mankind; though (Kubrick) has made here a movie about the arrival of Old World evils in America, he is exploring most specifically an old question: Why do humans constantly perpetuate such \"inhumanity\" against humans? That family is the family of man. Reaction to Blakemore's article has been mixed over the years, although some critics have latched onto his hypothesis and ran with it. For example, Ari Kahan of the Kubrick FAQ is in total agreement with Blakemore. Kahan argues that The Overlook Hotel is America. America, like the Overlook, is built on an Indian graveyard. The blood of the buried Indians seeping up through the elevator shafts is silent. So are the Indian tapestries that Danny rides over on his Big Wheel. The Shining is Kubrick's observation that America is built on hypocrisy, on a failure -- a refusal -- to acknowledge the violence from which it is born. That violence remains silent today because we refuse to look in the mirror - where all the ugly truths appear: Redrum spelled correctly; Jack's old crone, etc. ... July 4th marks the commemoration of the ugliness on which this country is built: it is the demarcation of the annihilation of the aboriginal people, and the formal establishment of the new society. Americans \"overlook\" the bloodshed upon which our society is founded: the British (Grady) heritage of violent colonialism, carried forward by American (Jack) colonizers.",
            "Like several other aspects in the story, this is explained in the book but is left far more ambiguous in the film.In the book, the woman's name is Mrs. Massey. She came to the Overlook Hotel to conduct an affair with a much younger man; every night, she would get very drunk at the bar, and the two would go back to the room (room 217 in the novel) to have sex. After several days, the young man came down while Mrs. Massey was passed out and took off with the Porsche in which they'd arrived. He didn't return. The following evening, Mrs. Massey got into the bathtub in her room and killed herself by taking thirty sleeping pills washed down with liquor. After her body was discovered, Mr. Massey flew in from New York and threatened to sue Stuart Ullman. However, after realizing what a scandal it would cause both of them, Ullman and Massey covered up the incident by bribing the coroner to change the cause of death from suicide by overdose to heart attack. Afterwards, anyone with the shining ability was able to see Mrs. Massey in the bathtub of the room.In the movie, this entire subplot is excluded, yet the old woman (Billie Gibson) in the bathtub is present, albeit with little or no explanation for who she is or why she is there. The most obvious explanation in the context of the film is that room 237 is merely a haunted room where an old lady died and, when Danny entered the room, the old lady tried to strangle him. However, when Jack goes into the room, instead of seeing an old lady, he sees a beautiful young woman (Lia Beldam) in the tub. Only after he begins kissing her does he look into the mirror and realize that she has turned into the old woman, who subsequently chases him from the room. This discrepancy (between Danny's experience and Jack's experience) is sometimes interpreted as Jack's complete embracing of the evil in the hotel, choosing it over his family; metaphorically represented by the fact that he has no qualms about committing adultery with this woman. Once he has embraced the evil, it shows its true form, as it no longer needs to seduce him; i.e. it no longer needs to appear attractive to him, hence it shows itself for what it truly is (in this case, a hideous old woman). Another theory is that the woman is Grady's wife, whom he murdered along with his two daughters. Grady's murder of his family is the only instance of murder which occurred in the hotel (at least as far as we know), and prior to Jack's entry to room 237, the only ghosts seen up to that point are the Grady daughters. Stuart Ullman mentions that Grady stacked the bodies in an unspecified room, and then shot himself; this room could theoretically be room 237, hence the reason why both Danny and Hallorann sense something troubling emanating from that room. A third theory is provided by film critic Jonathan Romney, who argues that perhaps the scene doesn't take place at all; Whether or not Danny's telepathy brings the Overlook's specters to life, what's certain is that the boy is actually able to transmit them. The film's big horror routine - Jack's encounter in Room 237 with an etiolated vamp turned suppurating hag - might not really be happening at all (Jack subsequently tells Wendy he's seen nothing in the room), but may in its entirety be a hyperimaginative boy's visual metaphor for the urgency of events. There's a stark difference between the shots of Danny wide-eyed in shock elsewhere in the film and the images of him here, in a dribbling trance, not so much transfixed as in a state of extreme concentration, as if he's at once composing the images and sending them. Filmmaker Paul Mayersberg provides still another view: It would be wrong to insist on a single interpretation of this scene, but in looking at it, it exposes the heart of Kubrick's method in the film. First, it is a rewrite of the shower scene in Psycho (1960). In Psycho it is the lady in the shower who is threatened by the monster outside. In The Shining this is reversed. Jack is the \"monster\", scared by what might emerge from the shower behind the curtain. This reversal of well-known horror conventions is one of many in the film. Underlying many sequences in The Shining is a critique of the whole genre of horror movies. The character of Jack Torrance himself is presented as the innocent, not knowing what he is getting himself into, whereas he is in fact the threatening element. Secondly, the woman turning from slim youth to grotesque age is perhaps symbolic of everyone's most feared destiny, growing old. To watch your own body over a period of years disintegrate before the mirror is an essential horror story for all of us. Fear of old age grips Jack Torrance by the throat as does fear of losing his mind. Growing old and losing your senses, time passing, is a frightening notion that is inescapable. Thirdly, it is the only overtly sexual scene in the movie. The Shining is a strangely chaste horror story. Part of this comes from Jack's sexual indifference; he is always glancing at women, including his wife, but he never actually does anything to them. Lack of sexual drive is characteristic of a paranoid personality. The young naked woman also seems asexual. She looks like one of those models who pose in seedy lunchtime photographic clubs. Fourthly, the marks on the old woman's body, which so repel Jack, are difficult to identify. When she rises out of the bath in a shot that seems to refer to Henri-Georges Clouzot's Diabolique (1955)",
            "In Jack's interview at the start of the film, Stuart Ullman tells him the story of a former caretaker who got cabin fever, butchered his family with an axe and then shot himself. The man's name was Charles Grady. Later on in the film, Jack meets a butler also called Grady and Jack explains to him that he knows all about the man's murder of his family, as he saw the pictures in the paper and he recognizes him. The problem is that the butler's name is Delbert Grady, not Charles Grady. Some viewers see this as a continuity error while others conclude that it could not possibly exist by accident and, therefore, must have meaning. On one hand, The Kubrick FAQ argues that the name change carries great significance; The duality of Delbert/Charles Grady deliberately mirrors Jack Torrance being both the husband of Wendy/father of Danny and the mysterious man in the July 4th photo. It is to say he is two people: the man with choice in a perilous situation and the man who has 'always' been at the Overlook. It's a mistake to see the final photo as evidence that the events of the film are predetermined: Jack has any number of moments where he can act other than the way he does, and that his (poor) choices are fueled by weakness and fear perhaps merely speaks all the more to the questions about the personal and the political that The Shining brings up. In the same way Charles had a chance - once more, perhaps - to not take on Delbert's legacy, so Jack may have had a chance to escape his role as 'caretaker' to the interests of the powerful. It's the tragic course of this story that he chooses not to. here[/link]] The argument is that Delbert Grady was the butler in the 1920s (as he says himself, he has \"always\" been at the Overlook) and Charles Grady was the caretaker in the 1970s (a man presented with a \"perilous situation,\" just as Jack would be years later), and rather than being two completely different people (or indeed the same person with two names), they are two \"manifestations\" of a similar entity; the part permanently at the hotel (Delbert) and the part which is given the choice of whether to join the legacy of the hotel's murderous past (Charles), just as the man in the photo is not the same man who Stuart Ullman hires to be the hotel's caretaker, but nor is he someone entirely different. Jack in the photo has \"always\" been at the Overlook, Jack the caretaker chooses to become part of the hotel (if one follows the logic of this argument, the implication is that the person in the July 4th photo would not in fact be called Jack).The problem with this argument is that the film itself provides no solid evidence for such a claim - any arguments that the change in name has any significance whatsoever remain wholly speculative. It also fails to address the fact that while Jack appears to learn of the story for the first time from Mr. Ullman, he later tells Grady that he learned of the incident via the newspaper (this may reference a scene from the book, wherein Jack spends an afternoon in the hotel basement reading a collection of clippings detailing the Overlook's history; that theory is supported by the fact that a scrapbook of clippings is indeed visible on Jack's writing desk in one scene, but despite its presence he's never shown reading or otherwise acknowledging it in any cut of the film). The viewer must additionally rationalize why Jack reacts to the name Delbert Grady and assumes this man to be the man initially named to him as Charles (an assumption Grady himself eventually confirms). It's perhaps significant to note that in the novel, the character is always known as Delbert. On the other hand, the film's assistant editor Gordon Stainforth] So, is the name change a continuity error or a hint at a deeper meaning? Stainforth is probably nearest the truth when he says \"I don't think we'll ever quite unravel this.\" There will always be those who will argue there is no way it could be as simple as a continuity error, and there will always be those who will argue that to explain such an obvious continuity error as intrinsically meaningful is absurd. As such, it is ultimately left up to each individual viewer to make up their own mind and reach their own conclusions as regards the ambiguity. The two names for both characters is a transformation/submission into evil. Delbert, as he is first introduced, is a nice polite butler but as the scene and movie go on we can get a sense of his transformation into Charles. The same may be suggested for Jack. While many can argue that Johnny is another name for Jack, as Bill to William for example. It has been said that the line was improved by Nicholson. But as Jack is \"hacking\" into the bathroom with the axe and yells the famous line \"Here's Johnny!\" Jack has completed his transformation into evil and will remain forever in the hotel as Delbert/Charles.",
            "One of the most chilling and surprising shots in the movie is the man in the horrible, bear suit giving felattio to a man dressed in a tuxedo. The movie doesn't expressly explain the identity of the man, but in the book, Stephen King provides the answer. In brief, it references a scene from the book in which the Overlook Hotel's former owner, Horace Derwent, is receiving fellatio from a pining lover Roger, who is dressed in a dog costume. However, Kubrick made some key changes for specific reasons.",
            "According to Stanley Kubrick: For the purposes of telling the story, my view is that the paranormal is genuine. Jack's mental state serves only to prepare him for the murder, and to temporarily mislead the audience... As the supernatural events occurred you searched for an explanation, and the most likely one seemed to be that the strange things that were happening would finally be explained as the products of Jack's imagination. It's not until Grady, the ghost of the former caretaker who axed to death his family, slides open the bolt of the larder door, allowing Jack to escape, that you are left with no other explanation but the supernatural. here[/link]]",
            "The spirit of Delbert Grady unlocked the door. Fans of the film, like film psychologist Rob Ager also suggests that it could have been Danny so that Jack could be trapped in the maze.",
            "Jack chases Danny out of the hotel into the hedge maze. Danny backtracks in the snow, carefully placing his feet into his own footprints, then hides in the hedges until Jack goes by. Following his own footprints into the maze, Danny makes his way out of the maze and into Wendy's arms. Wendy loads him into Hallorann's Snow Cat, and they drive away, leaving Jack ranting wildly in the maze. The final scene shows Jack frozen to death in the snow. The camera then pushes in on a display of photos hanging in the Gold Room. One of them, a photo of the July 4th Ball of 1921, features a group of partygoers with Jack at the head.",
            "Whenever Jack sees a ghost, a mirror is always present, e.g., when he meets Lloyd there is a mirror behind the bartender, when he speaks with Grady there is a long mirror beside them, and when he encounters the woman in room 237 there is a full length mirror in front of him. The only ghost scene that doesn't have a mirror is the one where he can't actually see the ghost (when Grady speaks to him from outside the pantry). Some viewers have argued that this indicates that the ghosts are not real at all and that Jack is essentially talking to himself by projecting another figure into the mirror. However, there are no mirrors present when Danny sees the Grady sisters or when Wendy begins to encounter ghosts towards the end of the film. As director Kubrick intended that the ghosts in the film be seen as real, the presence of mirrors in the scenes of Jack's encounters, while it may offer food for viewer discussion, does not provide a strong argument for the stance of the ghosts being not real.",
            "Perhaps the most obvious, and possibly most important, difference is in the depiction of the protagonist/antagonist, Jack Torrance. In the book, Jack is initially presented as an inherently good man, well-intentioned and protective of his family, but struggling with alcoholism, and battling to overcome his passionate hatred for authority (something which stems from his overly disciplinarian father, who, although he is dead, is still a major factor in Jack's life). Jack is presented as well-meaning, but weak-willed; not an evil man by any means, but a man who can be easily manipulated into doing evil things. Over the course of the novel, he becomes overwhelmed by the forces he encounters in the hotel, and eventually, he becomes totally subservient to them, unable to control his own actions, and carrying out the wishes of the hotel without question as he tries to murder his own wife and son (interestingly, there is a scene towards the end of the novel which many fans argued should have been in the movie as it was a pivotal point of the story in terms of the psychology of Jack: after trapping Wendy and Danny in the hotel, Jack's inherent \"goodness\" resurfaces and he helps them escape the building, only to once again succumb to the evil forces surrounding him, and recommence his pursuit). Contrary to the good-natured, genial and well-meaning family man of the novel however, the film's Jack (Jack Nicholson) is established as being irritated by his family from the very start (seen in his exasperation and sense of boredom in the car as they journey to the hotel, and in Wendy's story of how he accidentally dislocated Danny's shoulder). Additionally, his alcoholism is under mentioned (though his aggression is hinted at), and his hatred of authority and issues with his father are not mentioned at all.Because of the changes made to Jack's character, the character and purpose of Stuart Ullman is also dramatically altered. In the novel, Ullman is extremely despotic, supercilious and condescending. Indeed, he even tells Jack that he personally didn't want him for the job as caretaker, but was overruled by his superiors. This attitude of condescension in turn brings out Jack's issues with authority, and the psychological duel between Jack and Ullman is the primary subject matter of the first few chapters (in fact the opening sentence of the novel is Jack musing about how Ullman is \"an officious little prick\"). In the film however, Ullman (Barry Nelson) is a much more genial character, seemingly genuine in his pleasantness and quite amiable to Jack. As such, he serves little psychological purpose in the filmic narrative, whereas in the novel, his character's raison d'etre is so as the audience can be directly presented with Jack's authority issues. In the film, the character exists primarily to drive forward the plot and fill in some important exposition.Wendy is also considerably different in the novel and the film. In one of the more controversial changes made by Kubrick and Johnson, the Wendy of the film (Shelley Duvall) is a woman of great timidity and passivity, subservient to her husband even when he isn't present, such as in the scene where she nervously defends his breaking of Danny's arm to the aghast doctor (Anne Jackson). In the book, however, Wendy is far more self-reliant and possessed of a much more forceful personality. Her reaction to Jack's madness is also different: in the film, she nearly goes to pieces, becoming hysterical and frightened, acting only out of an instinct to survive and protect her son. While she retains her sanity and overcomes her hysteria long enough to save her son and herself more than once, she is very fragile. In the novel, however, she finds an inner strength and determination in the face of the danger posed by her husband, emerging as an indomitable character with a great resiliency.Aside from playing down Jack's battle with alcoholism and turning Wendy from a strong character into a weaker one, the most controversial change from the novel to the film was in relation to the \"purpose\" of the forces in the Overlook Hotel; exactly why does the evil send Jack mad, what does it want? In the novel, there is a very straightforward explanation for the hotel's nefarious activities: it wants Danny. If Jack kills Danny within the confines of the hotel, Danny's spirit will be absorbed into the hotel itself, and the evil will take possession of Danny's shining ability, thus making it infinitely more powerful and able to extend itself beyond the actual Overlook itself. In the film, however, the motives of the evil are much more ambiguous, and are never fully clarified with any degree of certainty. There is no intimation whatsoever in the film that the hotel specifically wants Danny (Danny Lloyd). Instead, it seems much more concerned with Jack himself, and ensuring that Jack carry out the task of killing Danny and Wendy (although exactly why the hotel wants them dead is never explained). The implication in the film is that Jack is in some way tied to the hotel, as indicated in the final shot, the photograph from the 1921 July 4th ball (this photo is unique to the film; in the novel, there are no hints of any kind that Jack is connected to the hotel or has ever been there before). It's implied the hotel wants Jack to repeat the actions of Grady by killing his family, perhaps to gain more spirits or bc such a murder (and the resulting spirit(s) would strengthen the hotel. Danny's shining ability is only important insofar as he is able to sense the evil in the hotel which is closing in on his father; the hotel itself appears to have no real interest in him per se.The character of Danny himself is also slightly different. Whilst he is in possession of a supernatural power in both book and film, and whilst the nature of his shining ability is relatively similar in text and on screen, the real difference is in the \"character\" of Tony. In the book, Tony is Danny's future self, sending messages back through time to aid his younger persona. Indeed, at the end of the novel, it is revealed that Danny's middle name is Anthony. In the film, however, the status of Tony is far less important; he is presented simply as an imaginary friend. In this sense, Danny's description of him as \"the little boy who lives inside my mouth,\" is unique to the film.The d\u00e9nouement is also very different in the novel and the film. In the novel, Hallorann is not killed. Jack bludgeons him with a mallet, but does not kill him, and ultimately, Hallorann escapes with Wendy and Danny. In the film, Hallorann (Scatman Crothers) is killed only moments after arriving at the hotel. Additionally, although Jack pursues Danny out into the grounds of the hotel in both novel and film, in the novel, the topiary animals come to life and begin to pursue the characters, whereas in the film there is a chase through a snow-covered hedge-maze (as is reasonably well known amongst fans, Kubrick did want to feature the living topiary animals, but after doing some special effects tests, he concluded that the scene could not be made to look realistic enough, hence the creation of the maze scenes as a replacement). Also, at the end of the novel, the Overlook Hotel is completely destroyed by a fire caused by an malfunctioning boiler. No such explosion takes place in the film, and the hotel is still very much standing at the end of the narrative. Indeed, in the film, the responsibilities of the Torrances regarding the boiler are never mentioned, but in the novel, Jack is supposed to dump the boiler every night. The film shows the boiler only once, as Wendy is in the basement prior to Jack's dream.There are numerous other differences between the film and the novel. For example, the film's omission of the character of Horace Derwent (see above); indeed, in the novel, it is the ghost of Derwent who tells Jack to destroy the snowmobile. The film omits a clear explanation as to who the woman in room 237 is (see above) though it's strongly implied she's Grady's deceased wife, disturbed in death like her daughters and insane husband. Jack's discovery of a scrapbook detailing the violent and sordid history of the hotel (it is seen on his desk in the film, but it is never mentioned) is deleted. In the film, Jack disables the CB radio by removing the battery and disables the snow cat by removing a piece of the engine, but in the novel, he destroys both with the use of a croquet mallet."

The thing is Conan had stolen this medallion from the sacred snake pit in Doom's right hand's temple. It was probably one-of-a-kind, or more rare than he guessed, because we see the last guard he interacted with move from his post to find Thorgrim and Rexor. Conan had left the medallion with this guard, who'd probably heard that it was stolen from Rexor's temple. Conan is captured soon after. He is called \"infidel\" as he was called in the temple when he originally ran away with the medallion. From that we can assume the stolen medallion did indeed give him away."

        "answers": [
            "As the sub was approaching the island, Indy could have easily determined that there was a dock hidden there -- we see the cavern's entrance through the periscope -- and simply jumped off the sub and swam to shore. From there, he could have swam at least some of the way underwater and into the cavern. This is likely as we see Indy's still wet when he steals the German soldier's uniform.",
            "The most likely explanation for the initially extraordinarily tense relationship with the emotionally turbulent Marion Ravenhood is that Marion had romantic or even sexual relations with Indy when she was a young adolescent. Indy was born in 1899. Which would make him 36-37 during the film. Marion Ravenwood was born in 1909. Making her 26-27. Marion says \"I've learned to hate you in the last 10 years. So Indy would have been in his mid-20s and she around 16 or 17 when they first met and fell in love. The implication is that she felt taken advantage of by the older, more experienced man, an inappropriate relationship which also caused Indy's falling out with her father Abner, Indy's friend and mentor.",
            "Toht picked up the original during the fight in Marion's bar. Because it was extremely hot from being in the fire, the markings of one side of the headpiece was burned into his hand, which Belloq was able to copy. It proved to be worthless, however, because the markings on the other side of the original gave further instructions.There's also the explanation that since Toht was an evil Gestapo agent that the medallion burned him because of his nature. The medallion wasn't really in contact with any fire, only some burning straw on the floor.",
            "You can see in the map room that the building marked for where the Nazi's are digging is directly in line with the one Indy sees illuminated, which suggests that Belloq used the correct hole, only his staff was too long. In the screenplay it states, Out in the miniature city, one small building is being lit by a tiny beam of sunlight in the center of the shadow of the metal sun. And by some trick of ancient artistry, this one building responds to the sunlight like none of the others. The golden light permeates it: it seems to glow. The building is in direct line with Belloq's -- all the Frenchman's other calculations were right -- but it is a foot and a half beyond it.",
            "Because he knew where the Ark was but had not found it yet. The location of the Ark he'd gotten from the previous scene showed that it was still pretty close to the main excavation. They could dig for it there, fairly well hidden from the Nazis and Belloq, but it was still close enough that they could be discovered -- which is exactly what happens when Belloq spots them later.If Marion disappeared suddenly, Belloq and the Nazi officers would do just what Indy said; they'd comb the place until she was found. An extensive search of the entire site would lead them to Jones, Sallah, and their dig, so Indy leaves her bound and gagged, much to Marion's fury, and promises to return for her when they'd find the Ark and have it safely away from the Nazis.",
            "Both Marion and Belloq were trying to fool each other into thinking the other was drunk. Both are hardy drinkers, as we see with Marion winning the shot contest in her bar early in the movie against a man much larger than herself. Belloq was also a hardy drinker, having grown up drinking the wine he provided, which was, in his cheerful words, \"my family label.\" Wine is much less potent than the whiskey Marion was drinking earlier, and she was able to stay sober. Assuming that Belloq was going to be inebriated faster than she was, she could escape easier. However, her assumption was wrong, and Belloq was just as sober as she was-and Toht arrived just at the moment she tried to walk out.",
            "There is a deleted scene in which you see Indy holding on to the periscope, which is sticking out of the water. Early submarines generally traveled the oceans on the surface of the water under diesel power, which requires access to the air for inlets to the engines. They could only travel short distances under water, as this required electric propulsion and the battery power of the submarine did not last very long. German U-boats would only submerge when they'd attack surface ships. However, there would generally be four or five crewman on the conning tower as lookouts. U-boats generally would submerge to a depth of roughly 12 meters, deep enough to observe the surface through the periscope. In the novelization, Indy lashed himself to the periscope with his bullwhip and rode/dozed through 20 frigid hours in oceanic water. In the movie, we never see the sub fully submerge, so are left with the conclusion that Indy rode on the top, a more believable scenario than riding it underwater without freezing or drowning.",
            "A deleted scene was shot where Imam, the scholar translating the markings on the headpiece of the Staff of Ra also translates another set of markings, which gives a warning about not looking into the Ark. Since this scene is not in the movie, it is a little confusing as to how Indy knew that he could only survive the opening of the Ark by closing his eyes. Perhaps he simply remembered the picture of the Ark he showed to the army officers; in it, an entire army is decimated, but the people carrying the Ark remain unaffected. So he may have concluded that opening the Ark is not necessarily deadly to anyone in close proximity, and that it is the visual contact that was deadly. Another option is that he remembered a relevant passage from the Bible (1 Samuel 6:19), where God \"smote\" the men of Beth Shemesh for looking into the Ark. Plus, there's a brief moment when Marcus Brody says the light from the Ark could lay waste to everything it touched, further warning of the Ark's power."

            "This is far and away the most hotly debated topic concerning the film. In the Philip K. Dick novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? Deckard was not a replicant. He is even tested to make sure. Indeed, the idea that Deckard may be a replicant seems to go against Dick's intent; The purpose of this story as I saw it was that in his job of hunting and killing these replicants, Deckard becomes progressively dehumanized. At the same time, the replicants are being perceived as becoming more human. Finally, Deckard must question what he is doing, and really what is the essential difference between him and them? And, to take it one step further, who is he if there is no real difference? Thus the idea that Deckard is \"becoming\" a replicant is a metaphorical one, not something to be taken literally. Hampton Fancher agreed with Dick on this point and when asked this very question in an interview he stated unequivocally that Deckard was not a replicant. However, in a September 2007 interview with Wired magazine, the film's director, Ridley Scott, stated what he considers to be the official answer to the question; that Deckard is a replicant: Wired: It was never on paper that Deckard is a replicant.Scott: It was, actually. That's the whole point of Gaff, the guy who makes origami and leaves little matchstick figures around. He doesn't like Deckard, and we don't really know why. If you take for granted for a moment that, let's say, Deckard is a Nexus 7, he probably has an unknown life span and therefore is starting to get awfully human. Gaff, at the very end, leaves an origami, which is a piece of silver paper you might find in a cigarette packet, and it's a unicorn. Now, the unicorn in Deckard's daydream tells me that Deckard wouldn't normally talk about such a thing to anyone. If Gaff knew about that, it's Gaff's message to say, \"I've read your file, mate.\" That relates to Deckard's first speech to Rachael when he says, \"That's not your imagination, that's Tyrell's niece's daydream.\" And he describes a little spider on a bush outside the window. The spider is an implanted piece of imagination. And therefore Deckard, too, has imagination and even history. Read the complete interview here.Similarly, in Deck-A-Rep: The True Nature of Rick Deckard (2007), Scott comments, I want to see what's inside his head, so it better be something extraordinary. So he's a romantic, because he's thinking about this unicorn. So that at the end of the film, I can have something absolutely remarkable, which I can illustrate, which is the unicorn, and he goes like that, 'Boom.' How would anyone have known what was inside his head other than someone who knew what was in his file, that had been implanted in his brain? Can't be any clearer than that. If you don't get it, you're a moron.Actor Harrison Ford however considers Deckard to be human. \"That was the main area of contention between Ridley and myself at the time,\" Ford told interviewer Jonathan Ross during a BBC1 Hollywood Greats segment. I thought the audience deserved one human being on screen that they could establish an emotional relationship with. I thought I had won Ridley's agreement to that, but in fact I think he had a little reservation about that. I think he really wanted to have it both ways.A number of the other filmmakers have also commented on this issue. Associate producer Ivor Powell: Ridley wanted Deckard to have an unusual daydream while he was sitting at his piano. Something like a very private thought. One that Gaff would later know without being told. Which was meant to suggest that Deckard was a replicant. Which in turn explains the significance of Gaff leaving a tinfoil unicorn for Deckard to find at the end of the picture. (Future Noir, 357) Producer Michael Deeley: I never thought Deckard was a replicant. That was just a bullshit, an extra layer Ridley put in. Also an obfuscation. Not only did I never believe Deckard was a replicant, I also thought it was futile to try and make him one. That was Ridley's theory, even if it didn't make any sense. Why would you do that? Deckard would be the first replicant you'd knock off if you were getting rid of them. Anyway, just because you say, 'Wouldn't it be funny if Deckard was a replicant?' doesn't necessarily make it so. (Future Noir, 362) Supervising editor Terry Rawlings: Ridley never wanted to bring out a troupe of dancing bears holding up neon signs reading, 'Deckard is a replicant!' Instead, he was going for something more ambiguous. Ridley himself may have definitely felt that Deckard was a replicant, but still, by the end of the picture, he intended to leave it up to the viewer to decide whether Deckard was one. (Future Noir, 363-364) Terry Rawlings: I often get asked if Deckard is a replicant, and I think that you've got to make up your own mind. That's what's intended with the film. It's your choice. (\"Deck-A-Rep\") Future Noir author Paul Sammon: When people ask me, 'he is a replicant, isn't he?' to my way of thinking, the only correct and proper answer is \"Maybe\". (\"Deck-A-Rep\")Some of the standard arguments put forward suggesting that Deckard is indeed a replicant include:1. Gaff seems to follow Deckard everywhere - he is at the scene of Zhora and Roy's retirement almost immediately, and he is always with Bryant when Bryant is speaking to Deckard. The argument is that Gaff is the real blade runner, and that he is monitoring Deckard as he carries out his assignment. If Deckard is a Nexus 7, then Gaff could be observing Deckard as an experimental subject.2. In the scene in his bathroom, when Rachael asks Deckard if he would follow her if she left, he says he wouldn't and then leaves the room, but he stops, puts his hand on her shoulder and says, \"But someone would.\" When he says this, Deckard's eyes have a red glow, the same effect seen in the other replicants' eyes and in Tyrell's owl. In relation to this scene, Ridley Scott maintains that that effect was purposely set up and executed on the set, but Harrison Ford denies this, saying it was unintended. In an interview with Paul Sammon in 2007, Ford comments simply, \"I might have strayed into her light\" (Future Noir, 565 - 2nd Edition).3. Although Deckard appears weak in comparison to Roy and Leon, he survives his beatings remarkably well. After being thrown around by Leon and slammed through a car windscreen; the only injury he seems to have is some blood in his mouth, his upper torso is unmarked. The argument here is that although Deckard doesn't have the superior strength of most replicants, he does have their ability to endure punishment.4. Replicants have a penchant for photographs, because it gives them a tie to their non-existent past (we see this in relation to both Leon and Rachael). Deckard's flat is packed with photos, and none of them are recent or in color.5. Some fans argue that when Roy reaches out and grabs Deckard, you can hear him say \"kinship.\" Rutger Hauer has rubbished this suggestion, however.6. Gaff tells Deckard \"You've done a man's job, sir!\" Early drafts of the script have him then add: \"But are you sure you are a man? It's hard to be sure who's who around here.\"7. A tentative claim which argues that Deckard is not a replicant is that all the replicants are called by their first names (Zhora, Pris, Roy, Leon and Rachael), but all the humans are called by their surnames (Holden, Bryant, Gaff, Chew, Tyrell, Sebastian). Deckard is also called by his surname throughout the film.",
            "Deckard kills Zhora in the midst of a crowded street, whereas Leon picked a deserted alley to attack. Obviously, the nearby police were unaware of what was transpiring in the alley. The Los Angeles depicted in the film is quite obviously an overcrowded metropolis and such incidents would easily go unnoticed.",
            "After Roy kills Tyrell, Sebastian is not seen again. However, what happened to him is explained clearly by the film; as Deckard gets a radio call while in his vehicle, we hear that two bodies have been found at the Tyrell Corp. building, one of which is that of J.F. Sebastian. Also, just after Roy kills Tyrell he approaches Sebastian, who looks very upset and scared. We can also hear, at least in the Final Cut edition of the film, Roy saying \"I'm sorry, Sebastian.\" Roy likely killed Sebastian out of his fury with Tyrell but also so there wouldn't be a living witness to his murder of Tyrell.",
            "There is much disagreement amongst both fans and filmmakers as to exactly why Roy saves Deckard's life at the end of the film. For example, according to Ridley Scott, It was an endorsement in a way, that the character is almost more human than human, in that he can demonstrate a very human quality at a time when the roles are reversed and Deckard may have been delighted to blow his head off. But Roy takes the humane route. But also, in a way, because Roy wants a kind of death watch, where he knows he is going, dying. So in a sense, he is saving Deckard for something, to pass on the information that what the makers are doing is wrong - either the answer is not to make them at all, or deal with them as human beings. (Future Noir, 193)\nAccording to Rutger Hauer, however, there is an altogether more mundane reason behind Roy's actions; Ridley insisted that one thing Batty had to have was absolutely no sense of hesitation. He doesn't reflect, he reacts. He's faster than anybody. A characteristic of the Nexus 6. So, if you follow that thought, you reach a point where you realize that if somebody falls, Batty grabs. It has nothing to do with how he feels about Deckard, it's just a reactive moment. That's what Roy's built for. In fact, while we were shooting this moment, we had a problem with the rain machines and had to wait around for them to be fixed. And I actually asked, \"Ridley, what do you think? Why does Roy save this fucker?\" And Ridley looked at me and said, \"It's purely a reflex. Other than that, I don't know.\" This response might bother some people, because so many folks have read a lot of meaning into Batty saving Deckard's life. But actions always come first. Then we think about them. Roy doesn't know why he saves Deckard or grabs a dove. He just does it. (Future Noir, 194)\nOf course, it is very well possible that the actual grasping and saving are two separate actions by Roy. Throughout the film, Roy has shown that he has no problem with killing. Even if Roy grasped Deckard in a reflex, if he really wanted him dead, he could just have released him and let him fall to his death. Holding on to Deckard and even hoisting him up to safety therefore feels like a deliberate act, and Roy may even be conflicted about his reasons for doing it himself.In the theatrical cut, the scene is followed by a narrative voiceover by Deckard: I don't know why he saved my life. Maybe in those last moments he loved life more than he ever had before. Not just his life-anybody's life; my life. All he'd wanted were the same answers the rest of us want. Where did I come from? Where am I going? How long have I got? All I could do was sit there and watch him die."

            "The real-world reason is probably that when making Evil Dead II (1987), director Sam Raimi did not have the rights to re-use footage from The Evil Dead (1981) (as Evil Dead II was produced by another company). So the first 7 minutes of Evil Dead II (1987) are effectively a short recap of the entire first movie, featuring Ash and Linda but none of the other friends, to speed things up. The Book of the Dead also looks quite different, and its destruction is missing. This may have been done on purpose, because the makers had developed new ideas for the sequel, forcing them to retcon (retroactively change) the original backstory. In any way, as soon as Ash goes outside and is attacked by the demonic force, the story continues from the first movie. A similar thing happened during production of Army of Darkness (1992): the film was made by yet another production company, who wanted to make it as a stand-alone picture instead of an obvious sequel (the name 'Evil Dead' could not be used anyway due to copyright issues). The writers/director again used this opportunity to change the backstory, for the benefit of a more dramatic beginning of Army of Darkness. This explains why the opening scene of 'Army' is a reinterpretation of the final scene of Evil Dead II. Each of the Evil Dead movies has its own unique perspective, which explains most of the breaks in continuity. It has the added benefit that each movie in the series can be viewed apart, without having seen the other movies.From an in-story perspective, we see at the end of the second sequel 'Army of Darkness' that the entire story is being told in flashback by Ash to a bored and disbelieving co-worker (played by Ted Rami) back at his S-Mart job. This sequence is included as the final scene of the original cinema version, whilst the video/DVD/BluRay release ends with Ash awaking in a post-apocalyptic world but then has him returned to S-Mart in his own time after the end credits. Therefore we must assume the events we see in the last 2 films are based upon Ash's recollection which is likely to be far from perfect given his numerous head injuries, undoubted post traumatic stress disorder and the basic imperfections of human storytelling (simplifying the story, skipping over parts too complex to explain etc)."

            "After the blood test, the survivors, presumed to not be infected went to give the final test to Blair. Had Blair not been assimilated, the group would have likely continued to live on.\nUnfortunately Blair was infected and they found out far too late. As they went to give Blair the test, he had sneaked in to the base and destroyed the power generator. Once this happened, the group knew there was no chance of survival in the harsh climate of Antarctica. So their only option was to kill the creature at all costs.",
            "The dog belonged to the Norwegians and hence was actually a dog-thing (the thing impersonating a dog). This is the reason the last remaining crew from the Norwegian base were trying to kill it. The Americans take it in after the Norwegians are killed in the fight.",
            "Because they were the most likely to be infected. So they were drugged in order to be incapacitated. Also if they were infected, the morphine would likely have little to no effect. Thus possibly revealing them sooner.",
            "Likely just one of many means of trying to infect other creatures. If any cell of a Thing can infect another organism, shooting a projectile liquid at one would be a form of ranged attack.",
            "Because Blair was the only one who realized they weren't dead yet and he had isolated himself before discussing this with anyone. The rest of the group thought it was best to put the most significant discovery in history in storage. They had assumed the creatures were dead. It wasn't until Fuchs discovered in Blair's notebook that the creatures were still alive. It's also possible Blair was assimilated shortly after writing in his notebook, but before he could tell anyone his findings.",
            "Because the movie is over 40 years old. While the creature effects are revolutionary and unique, they are still a product of their time. Props made to look human often didn't hold up to scrutiny as well as creature effects. Much like CGI effects of today.",
            "Likely because nobody, including the thing knew if the blood test would actually work. Mac didn't reveal his plans until after everyone was subdued and tied up. So Palmer had no choice but to sit there. When Mac says he's about to test Palmer's blood; Palmer doesn't have a look of fear or even of concern, but more of a \"guess we're about to find out if this test works...\".",
            "The likely explanation is that one of the infected people wanted to sew further mistrust among the remaining humans. Whoever passed by the lab that Fuchs saw and chased outside likely tossed Mac's clothing nearby. The intention being that Fuchs would find them and then tell the group of his discovery. Thus getting Mac out of the way. Instead Fuchs committed suicide. Again assuming he did commit suicide and wasn't murdered. The thing then had to try another approach and while everyone was searching the camp for Fuchs, the Thing snuck to Mac's shack and re-planted the clothes there. Leaving the light on in order to draw attention to it.",
            "Childs burns it with the flamethrower. A lot of people seem to think this part of the creature escapes in to the ceiling, but you can see it drop to the ground right after Childs torches it.",
            "It's possible Mac misspoke, at this point he hadn't slept in days.However, it's possible it was another pair that Windows found, but we just didn't see this. We know the three assimilated people are Blair, Norris and Palmer. While Blair was examining the remains of Splitface, Fuchs can be seen inspecting some shredded clothing. This was either attached to Splitface or perhaps the pair Windows found belonging to the first person assimilated. Next, Nauls finds a pair in the kitchen trash after Palmer, Norris and Mac return from finding the spaceship.",
            "Affectionally called 'Splitface' by fans, the backstory and demise of this creature is detailed in The Thing (2011), the prequel to this movie. It is a Thing that impersonated a Norwegian researcher and got heavily injured during an explosion. In a crippled state, it attached itself to another researcher and fused with him so that the new body could sustain the injured one. It was ultimately burnt with a flamethrower and, in its death struggle, it burst out through a wall, ending up burning and dying outside.",
            "It assimilated Bennings. The remainder that was left on the table was mostly the dead part that had been burned back at the Norwegian camp. This part, along with the near-assimilated Bennings-thing, were burned. However, the possibility also remains that a part or parts of Splitface could have detached from the body, escaped, and hidden in other areas of the complex, as this theory ties in with the fact that each individual part of a Thing has a goal of self-preservation, as evidenced by the Norris head Thing attempting to escape by detaching itself from its body.",
            "Like almost all the answers provided for the film; it can't be said with certainty. If it's possible for the Thing to infect someone on a cellular level, by say, contaminated food or by touch, then it could have infected anyone at any time. As some people feel Blair became infected after touching his pencil to the corpse of the dog-thing and then touched it to his lip. But if you watch the scene carefully, he never actually touches the pencil to the corpse, as that would be an extremely stupid thing for a biologist to do to any specimen, let alone a shape-shifting alien.So to keep things simple, let's just go with potential \"hostile takeovers\".Near the start of the film, when the dog-Thing is wandering around the camp. We see the dog approach a room, and we see the silhouette of someone in the room. According to John Carpenter, this was supposed to be Palmer, but his profile was too distinguishable. So they used a stand-in, wearing a collared shirt (like Norris wears) to make it less obvious. So the shadow could still belong to either Palmer or Norris. Though it was likely Norris, as Palmer shared a room with Childs, Norris would be more likely to be isolated.The next person infected (again either Palmer or Norris) would have likely happened after Palmer, Mac and Norris returned from finding the spaceship. As that would have had two assimilated people travelling with Mac to the crater. As the group sits around discussing what they found at the site, Nauls enters the room complaining that someone stuck their dirty clothes in the kitchen trash can. This could have happened before they left, but likely happened when they returned from the crater. Palmer or Norris could have gotten the other one alone, assimilated the other and then returned to the rec room to meet with Mac and the rest to talk about the discovery.Last, but certainly not least is Blair. The most likely time for him to be assimilated is when he's isolated and alone in the tool shed. Fuchs mentions that Blair locked himself in his room and wouldn't see anyone. But left his journals available for Fuchs to read. Blair could have been in the process of being assimilated when Fuchs went to speak to him. Blair's drunken meltdown where he destroys all the equipment and radio in order to prevent the thing from escaping, may have been a ruse to cut the group off in order to assimilate them one-by-one.",
            "A simple explanation would be that when a Thing assimilates someone, it rips through their clothes (as evident when Windows discovers Bennings' torn and bloody shirt and jacket in the storage room seconds before he sees him being assimilated, and Nauls finding either Palmer's or Norris' torn longjohns in a kitchen trash can stained with dried blood). And given the fact that none of them expected to need extra clothes on a helicopter trip, so if Norris and Palmer were things, if they assimilated Mac, they would have a hard time explaining why he is naked when they get back to camp. So they decided it was best not to take him then. Another theory is that Mac could still have been a thing. Even though he tied everyone down and came up with the hot needle blood test, it might very well have been that the test was a \"crock of shit\" as Childs put it. Then the Palmer Thing sacrificed itself by acting as if the blood test was successful to draw any suspicions away from Mac. However, this theory is less likely as it goes against the very nature of The Thing (self preservation above all else).There are two more possibilities here. The first and probably most logical is that one of them is still human at this point. Even if Palmer was the Thing, him leaving in the chopper and reporting Mac and Norris dead would not be a good move; it could easily be investigated. The second possibility is that neither Palmer nor Norris know that the other is a Thing, though this is highly contested. Just because Palmer and Norris were both revealed as Things later does not mean they were both Things at that given moment. We see Norris collapse later in the film. This is after Fuchs has informed us that a single cell of the Thing could (but not necessarily would) take over a whole person. Considering the manner of Norris' death, it could be suggested that he had been infected by a Thing (either through saliva from the dog, infected food, or whatever) and that at the crater Norris was still human, albeit, an infected human. Palmer, on the other hand, was almost assuredly a Thing by this point, though not brave enough to attempt to assimilate two people at once (which might have caused a crash and death for all). Interestingly, if Palmer was a Thing from the moment we see his shadow facing the dog, then later when we witness Childs and Palmer sharing a joint, it is conceivable that Childs became infected. Not that Childs becomes a Thing, as we witness in the blood test scene, but that he could have been well on his way to becoming a Thing.",
            "One of the many questions and plot lines with no definite answers, though there is one explanation that seems more logical. Due to the tension of the scene of the men determining who got to the blood (Garry or Copper), all of them seem to have forgotten that Windows had the master keys last. (However, Windows is visibly too afraid to admit that he had the keys last, probably speculating that the group would suspect him of tampering with the blood). In the scene when Windows gets the storage room keys from Garry and walks into the room to lock it up, we clearly hear him drop the keys when he runs out of the storage room after he discovers Bennings being assimilated. A few moments later, everyone except for Blair and Clark are outside huddled around the Bennings-Thing right before MacReady burns it. Just prior to being told about Bennings by Windows, Fuchs tells MacReady that Blair has locked himself in his room. This would have been a perfect opportunity for Blair to sneak out of his room, get the keys lying on the storage room floor, open the freezer locker in the storage room, and tamper with the blood by slicing the bags with a knife or razor (or even just the sharp end of the keys) before going out to kill the sled dogs, as well as destroy the tractor and helicopter. However, we never see Garry or Windows recovering the keys at all before Garry is seen the next morning giving the master keys to Copper to use to go open the freezer locker. (Also of note, earlier when the group is pinned down by the axe and gun-toting Blair who is destroying the radio equipment in the communications room, Garry is seen with the master keys back on the key chain on his belt.)When stored, blood plasma is nearly frozen, and would take several hours for it to thaw out and run the way it did when we first see the fridge locker several hours later in the morning with a trail of blood seeping from it when Copper arrives to open it. Therefore, the blood must have been tampered with quite a while ago which would point to the previous evening or night: more evidence that it could have been Blair. Other evidence pointing to Blair is that he is a biologist, he would understand that the blood could be used as a test to expose him as a Thing (if he was infected at the time), or if he was not infected at the time, he could have realized the possibility that the blood could be used as a means to infect the other men of the camp, as a part of his theory that one cell could take over an organism, and eventually the world. Of course you can't discount the possibility that it was either Norris or Palmer.The possibility of Norris or Palmer tampering with the blood isn't so far-fetched. If someone needs to simply request the keys from Garry, it's possible either Norris or Palmer (now infected) asked for the keys for something trivial before anyone even knew the dog was a thing although it's likely that Garry would have remembered. There are several keys on Garry's clip, and anyone could have asked for them citing another purpose: gathering supplies from a locked room, fuel for the helicopter, etc. Garry could have handed over the keys, either to Norris or Palmer, who would quickly open the fridge, tamper with the blood, lock it back up, hand the keys back to Garry and go on about their business. Unless someone was seriously injured, Copper likely wouldn't be going to check on the blood very often. So a lot of time could have passed from the time the blood was tampered with to the time it was discovered. (Also, if one takes the prequel into account, the Norwegian camp also came up with a similar blood test that was destroyed before it could be administered. The Thing would have carried that knowledge from that camp to the U.S. camp and decided to ruin that test as quickly as possible)",
            "In the television version of the Thing, an additional voice over at the beginning of the film states Norris has a heart condition and his character notes in the screenplay by Bill Lancaster mention it. Sometime after being assimilated by the Thing, we see Norris grimacing with pain while he is taking off the flamethrower on his back before helping the other men board up the outside doors and windows during a moment of stress. A few minutes later, when Norris sees Nauls returning alone from MacReady's shack, he clearly grabs his chest and is sweating, as if in great pain before the others run in. Another minute later, while struggling with MacReady, he is thrown to the floor, passes out, and is rushed to the medical room where Copper attempts to revive him, first with CPR, then with the defibrillator. On the 2nd application of the defibrillator, the Norris-Thing reveals itself, biting off Copper's arms. There are three generally accepted possibilities as to why the Norris-Thing had a heart attack: (1) It was a ploy by the Norris-Thing to get away from the men, faking death with the intention of either escaping or simply waiting for an opportunity to assimilate a lone individual, or (2) when the Thing assimilates a life form, it takes on an exact replica, including diseases and other characteristics as long as it's organic. Thus, the Thing was unable to sustain its existence as Norris-Thing because the Norris model's heart had failed. (3) Norris was infected on a cellular level after consuming contaminated food or possibly if it was Norris' room the dog-thing wandered in to, the dog could have simply licked Norris' hand or face and left the room. He was thus assimilated from the inside and as the process developed he started to have chest pains. He did not die from his failing heart but expired while being taken over. When his stomach explodes we can see a second Norris head has formed, probably while copying the original. This may also explain why Norris refused the leadership position when Garry suggested he take over. Because Norris felt \"off\", he knew something wasn't right with himself but wasn't sure what.In regards to Theory 1, the Burned Corpse-Thing brought back from the Norwegian camp uses a similar ploy, faking death until it has the opportunity to attack an isolated Bennings. What the Thing may not have counted on was the application of electricity from the defibrillator, which it likely perceived as an attack and prompted its attack on Copper. In regards to Theory 2, the Thing is never shown to have the ability to shape-shift from one person to another, or one creature to another. When the Thing assimilates the dog at the Norwegian camp, it stays in this form until it turns into the amorphous shape it uses for attacking. Since the Thing does not appear to be capable of transforming its shape without directly assimilating another life form, it can be suggested that the Thing is only capable of replicating life forms with which it is in immediate contact. In this theory, the Thing is only able to exactly replicate what it immediately finds. In Norris' case, the Thing replicates Norris exactly, including his heart condition.",
            "Whilst Norris was being treated in the infirmary, Clark grabs a scalpel off a table and hides it. In the next scene when MacReady wants to tie everybody down in order to do the blood test, Clark moves closer to Mac, pretending to support him in his idea. When Mac is arguing with Childs, Clark pulls out the scalpel and charges at Mac. So Mac turns and shoots Clark in the head. The shots of the scalpel are done in the foreground while something relatively important is happening in the background so lots of viewers miss Clark holding the scalpel. Lots of viewers thought Clark was just going to punch Mac, making Mac shooting him a bit extreme. Clark hiding the scalpel in his hand is much more clearly seen in the widescreen versions of the movie. The pan and scan versions omit Clark's hand holding the scalpel which would otherwise be on the far left of the screen. Also, at this point it was everyone against Mac. Everyone thought Mac was infected, so for Mac it was kill or be killed. Even if Clark had just intended to tackle MacReady, shooting him would have been Mac's only option. If Mac had simply tried to fight Clark, the rest of the team probably would have joined in and fought Mac, over-powering him. However, because Mac was willing to shoot Clark, it showed the rest of the team that he wasn't afraid to kill someone who made an attempt on him. Which is why as soon as Mac shoots Clark, we cut to everyone else already tied up. After Mac administers the test to Clark's blood and he's ruled out as assimilated, Childs calls Mac a murderer. However, Mac was also acting in self-defense.",
            "Probably because such behavior would make Palmer look more human and help him gain a little more trust from the group. Palmer only speaks out when Windows has also seen the spider-head. Palmer-Thing might normally have been willing to let the spider-head escape but, once it had been seen by a human, its survival was compromised anyway. Hence Palmer-Thing could as well take the opportunity to make an exclamation (saying \"You gotta be fucking kidding!\"; acting like a \"surprised human\"), thus diverting suspicion from himself. Whatever Palmer's reason for pointing out and revealing more of the Thing's abilities, it is clear in the movie that Thing imitations do not look out for other Thing imitations, and they are described in the short story as being \"selfish\". Mac himself says that they would crawl away from a hot needle to save itself. It is also possible that Palmer was still self-conscious and, thus, would react normally and bring attention to the Norris spider-head. As Mac says \"Watchin' Norris in there gave me the idea that... maybe every part of him was a whole, every little piece was an individual animal with a built-in desire to protect its own life.\" This scene is important because it perfectly mirrors the humans in the film: Thing imitations work together until one of them is compromised, then they turn against each other until they know they're safe again... often at the cost of one of their own.",
            "One of the biggest questions of the film that is never fully explained. We will first break down the sequence of events and then explain the motives behind each from a human and Thing perspective. Sequence of events: (1) Blair runs the computer program and discovers the possible threat the Thing poses, (2) Blair kills all the sled dogs and destroys the tractor (off-camera), (3) Blair destroys the helicopter, (4) Blair injures Windows and destroys the radio, (5) Blair is locked up outside in the shed, (6) Mac is questioning Blair in the shed as to the whereabouts of Fuchs, and (7) Blair has clearly been assimilated: he is building a ship, attacks Garry, etc.Now, the question is asked, why would a human Blair kill the dogs and destroy everything? At this point, it is very clear that Blair understands the situation and feels that his comrades do not. He is afraid that the Thing will escape and infect the entire planet. He kills the dogs, destroys the helicopter, and destroys the tractor to isolate the men. Although Blair says, \"no dog can make it a thousand miles to the coast,\" he was more or less referring to a dog on its own, and not a team with a master. He may have also killed the dogs to prevent infection when we see Clark at the dog kennel sorrowfully looking at a dead dog with a fire axe in it's neck, though we know that an axe would not be sufficient enough to prevent that but keep in mind that Blair has lost his sanity at this point. Blair destroys the radio so that no outside help can be reached; it could be another way out. If this was the case (that Blair was assimilated after his lock-up), it was either Palmer or Norris that got to him while he was locked up in the tool shed. Somewhere during the 48-hour period that Mac refers to on his tape recording would seem logical.The Thing perspective: The Blair-thing would have destroyed the tractor, radio, and helicopter to prevent the men from escaping and to keep them from reaching outside help. The dogs were killed to make his motives seem more human. The Blair-thing's plan worked; he was seeking isolation so that he could build a craft to escape. This makes it look as though the Thing's intentions are not to assimilate the entire Earth, but to simply get off the planet; had the Thing wanted to assimilate the entire planet, it could have just as easily stolen the helicopter as Palmer and fly to the nearest base, country, whatever but this assumes that the thing would only be able to pilot a helicopter as Palmer but this does not seem likely as it is building some kind of craft as Blair/thing.Just before being locked up, Blair tells Mac to watch out for Clark. Again there are two plausible possibilities as to what he meant, depending on whether he was infected yet. If Blair was still human, then it would have likely been that since he knew how the Thing worked, he deduced that since Clark had been isolated with the dog-Thing for a long period of time, there was a very strong chance Clark was infected. If Blair was a Thing, then he would have been trying to throw Mac off, drawing suspicion towards a man who was still human whilst the Thing continues to infect the team.Another possible, but remote, theory is that Blair was infected during the autopsy of the burned corpse-Thing or the remains of the dog-Thing. It was a cellular infection which took some time to gain control of his body and \"conscious\" mind. The Thing gained more control as the cellular infection increased over days. We know this is a considered by Blair. As the infected individual's body is slowly taken over, they remain conscious during this state but unaware that they are infected, but their actions are subtly influenced by the Thing's ever-increasing hold over them. Blair destroyed the dogs, tractor and chopper. The dogs being killed was a completely human response backed by his scientific knowledge that any one of the dogs could have been inadvertently infected during their attack in the kennel cage by hostile or cellular infection. In his destruction of the tractor and chopper, the Thing influenced his decisions.Think about it... The Thing was a masterful strategist. It had been alive for eons and assimilated hundreds, maybe even thousands of beings and intellects, a theory referred to by Fuchs when he has his private conversation with Mac about Blair's notes. Many of its actions had a two-fold and even three-fold win-win situation that still gave it an edge in the final game. Yes, Blair destroyed the tractor and chopper to prevent the infection from spreading to populated areas (human response), but he also destroyed them to hide the fact that he had stolen parts from both. The crew was less likely to investigate a smashed, ripped-apart tractor or chopper to see that all of the parts were there. Blair was well aware of military protocol and knew that his mental breakdown would call for them to isolate him, giving him time to assemble the parts and build a craft to get him to the nearest populated area. The craft was never meant for long distance travel. A third goal in destroying the tractor, chopper and communications was to prevent anyone from getting out until they were ALL infected. Military protocol would have been to capture and quarantine all parties involved until it was determined who was human and who was not. The Thing could not take the chance of someone contacting the rescue team and revealing the alien infection. However, Blair was not the only one who may have been infected by cellular means during the autopsy, as Fuchs may have also been infected!We see Blair performing the autopsy and Fuchs \"sniffing\" and going through the clothes of the Burned Corpse-Thing and other items there. Those garments and items are soiled with possible dried blood and other body fluids. Fuchs is seen standing there listening to Blair while going through the items without gloves or other personal protective equipment. Since the scene ends this way we can assume that Fuchs assisted Blair in other ways during this autopsy even if it was just \"Hold this\" or \"Move that.\" Cellular infection is highly probable at this point. This theory would also explain Fuchs' disappearance. By the time he talked to Mac, he knew that cellular infection was a strong possibility. Blair at this point was isolated and locked up (or so we thought), but Blair was secretly moving about the camp collecting and assembling the last of the parts and tools he needed to finish his craft. It is very possible that it was Blair who killed the power and walked past Fuchs' door in the dark. By the time Fuchs got outside to chase this suspicious person, he found Mac's undergarments.If cellular infection was possible, by this time Fuchs' actions would be influenced subconsciously as well, since he was infected during the same time period as Blair. Thus, after finding Mac's undergarments, Fuchs heads to Mac's shack, possibly planning to snoop around for more proof that Mac was infected before accusing him publicly (clearly a human response). While there, he stuffed Mac's shorts in the oil furnace, this being a subconscious influence by the thing to keep an ally hidden. In all likelihood, Fuchs began to question his own actions on the walk back to the main compound and came to the realization that he \"must\" be infected to have just done such a strange thing rather than exposing Mac. The Thing only attacks when discovered or \"attacked.\" Why wouldn't a self-realization spark an attack as well? At this point during Fuchs self-realization, the thing begins to reveal itself, going for a more quickened \"hostile takeover\" of Fuchs rather than the cellular option. As Fuchs begins to change and lose the last of his humanity, he does the only thing he can, setting himself on fire in the snow.Another hint that Blair has been infected before he destroys the radio and communications equipment is that his intentions, as \"the thing\", are to destroy any means of communication (radios) that will allow the remaining humans of the research outpost to contact the outside world and warn them of \"the thing\" that they unleashed from the ice. Blair, as \"the thing\", could prevent the humans from warning the rest of the world to either proceed with caution when approaching the arctic facility, or to isolate or even destroy the facility from afar. Once Blair, as \"the thing\" was completely sure that the existence of the creature was safe and only known to the remaining humans in the facility, \"the thing\" could take as much time as it needed to slowly and surely assimilate the rest of the crew.While Blair may have been infected on a cellular level when he autopsied the first remains of the thing early on in the film, it was slowly infiltrating his entire body, copying him slowly, to the point that Blair might have realized what was going on, causing his intense paranoia, enough to where he breaks down completely and attempts to kill everyone and destroy the communication equipment.The theory of cellular assimilation is possibly debunked by what happens to Bennings. The dog runs up to him and licks him, in theory this would be enough to begin cellular transformation yet he is the first on screen aggressive assimilation we see. If he was already being infected on a cellular level which is easier to hide why would this be necessary?A sign that Blair was himself when he was first quarantined in the outdoor shed by the others was that when MacReady and the others talk to him from outside the shed door to ask the whereabouts of Fuchs, we see that Blair had hung a noose from the ceiling, possibly in an attempt to hang himself before the thing had time to take over. Perhaps he realized that his remains would still have cellular activity and he figured suicide was pointless. Perhaps he just couldn't bring himself to do it. Or perhaps he made the noose intending suicide, then his mind was finally assimilated and the thing stopped him from taking his own life. It's also worth noting that in the same scene, Blair tries to talk Mac into letting him back into the main camp. The Blair-Thing was clearly taking advantage of its isolation, so it seems strange that it would run the risk of joining back up with the rest of the men, since he would not be able to continue working on his craft without drawing suspicion. Thus it would be logical to say that Blair was human (or at least in the process of being assimilated) at this point; he really did feel bad about his actions and want to leave the shack.But the other alternative is that the noose was a ruse. If Blair was a thing at that point, he would want to give the appearance of being normal, while still remaining isolated. A human Blair would, naturally, want to come back inside. But he would have to come up with a way to prevent that, without looking suspicious so he could keep working on the underground spaceship. If you were human, and trying to plead your case that you're recovered, would you leave something as obvious as a noose hanging over your shoulder? It has the same effect as saying you're sane while eating a bug.It's entirely plausible that Blair rigged the noose as an insurance policy on the off-chance that the men would decide on their own to let him back in, or talk to him at some point. He begs to be let back in, but anyone talking to him would be able to see the noose hanging behind him, and would then assume that he's still not all there. MacReady certainly notices it, as after Blair's normal conversation and outward appearance of being back to normal, his only reply to Blair about being allowed back into the outpost is a rather non-committal, \"We'll see\", followed by cutting him off mid-sentence as he further pleads to be let back inside.One theory that Blair has been infected early on is that he deliberately gets himself isolated by acting insane and out of control. Once he's alone in the cabin, outside of the surveillance of the other remaining crew members, he can begin digging the tunnel under the shed and building his ship that will allow him to escape to the mainland, or possibly even to outer space.In the original story, \"Who Goes There?\" on which this movie is based, the character or Blair has a nervous breakdown and they isolate him in solitary confinement in a cabin. Like the movie, the short story never states when exactly Blair was assimilated, but it is possible that he was assimilated beforehand and fakes the nervous breakdown. In the cabin, the Thing, in Blair's body, begins building an anti-gravity device to get back into space, or to leave Antarctica, but before it can complete it, the other crew members realize what is happening and they kill the Blair-Thing before it could complete its objective.Carpenter and Producer Stuart Cohen have indicated that their plan was for Blair to have been infected at a very early time, as he is in Campbell's short story. Cohen goes on to indicate that MacReady's line upon the discovery of the spaceship, \"Blair's been busy out here all by himself\" is to indicate that Blair was a thing for quite awhile, long enough to have adequate time to build the spacecraft.It's also worth noting that between the scene where he runs the computer simulation, and the time we see him again destroying the radio room, the yellow button-down shirt he was wearing has disappeared. The theory is that the thing rips through your clothes when it takes you over, so the disappearance of the shirt between the two appearances could definitely be because the shirt was destroyed in the take-over. We certainly see that the take-over destroys clothing, as Windows sees Bennings' destroyed shirt and vest in the storeroom after seeing Bennings in mid transformation.Fuchs tells MacReady in the Thiokol Snowcat that Blair \"Locked himself in his room and won't answer the door.\" The assumption is that he's despondent after running the simulation, or is prepping for what he's about to do, but it's also possible that after running the simulation and taking the gun, he was surprised by Norris or Palmer and assimilated during that time. As we see when Blair attacks Garry, all Norris or Palmer would have to do is be standing outside Blair's door and put their hand over Blair's mouth to prevent a scream, and the assimilation would already be happening. Then they would just lead Blair back inside and lock the door behind them. That would explain why Blair loses the shirt he's been wearing all along prior to the radio room rampage.",
            "This question is not directly answered by the film. The Thing does not necessarily have to go to a heavily populated area immediately, but find a means to escape the camp where its presence is known and being opposed. Ultimately, it must find other life forms to assimilate. This leads to a few possibilities. (1) The craft was to be used by the Thing to travel to another base in Antarctica or another country where it would have more life forms to replicate, or (2) The Thing was building a craft to travel into space away from Earth (the less likely explanation). Considering how small the craft being built was in comparison to the original crashed spacecraft, it is highly unlikely the Thing would be able to build a suitable craft from spare parts capable of traveling to somewhere else in the galaxy with known life forms. (3) The Thing was building the craft as a means of transport to get it to the crashed spaceship in the hopes of repairing it and flying it somewhere else, a theory given credence by the 2011 film where an infected human also makes his way back to it. Since, unlike the prequel film, Blair had destroyed most of the vehicles (apart from one or two small tractors that may not have been capable of traveling far), it had to make due with what it had, and so used the parts it could salvage (and possibly knowledge from prior victims) to improvise a simple vehicle that would do until he could get access to the more sophisticated flying saucer.Although the craft being built does resemble a flying saucer, it is unclear if the craft was intended to fly or travel on land (such as a snow mobile or hovercraft). Obviously, the craft would have to travel some distance before reaching the ocean, which would have to be traversed in order to reach another country. If the craft was capable of flight, the Thing could feasibly fly to another country. If the craft was intended to travel on land, then its purpose would be to find another base with humans, or a population of life forms, such as penguins, fish or birds. Of course, a hovercraft would be capable of both land and water travel. After replicating a penguin, fish or bird, the Thing could then just swim or fly to another country as that life form. It seems much more likely the Thing would attempt to assimilate as many life forms in Antarctica and use those to spread to other areas, rather than attempting to immediately travel to the nearest large landmass, most likely South America. In the original story that this film was based on, the thing in Blair's body nearly finished building an anti-gravity device in a shack in which it has isolated itself. The device would let it return to space using atomic power, but the remaining crew end up killing the thing before it can use the device to return to space or possibly fly to another heavily-populated area on Earth.",
            "From what we see in the movie, there seem to be two general ways in which a Thing can imitate another being. The first way could be dubbed a \"hostile takeover\". Which is where the Thing uses its tendrils to absorb its prey, while its body functions as some sort of womb where a copy of the absorbed prey is created. We see this occurring with the dogs, and also with Bennings' assimilation. When Blair is conducting the autopsy on the burned corpse of what remains of the dog-Thing he cuts out the half-formed replica of a dog. The Thing essentially makes an extra \"copy\" from its prey. Each \"copy\" of the Thing (or \"imitations\" as they are called in the film) is basically an exact replica or \"clone\" of the Thing in the form of the person or animal it kills. The other way is where the Thing infects another being with its cells, and the host is being taken over. This last process is most interesting, as it is never explained whether (1) people or animals that have become Things immediately die in the process of being assimilated by the Thing which then mimics its victims' voice, actions, and feelings, (2) the victims regain consciousness after assimilation and essentially host the Thing clone apparently unaware that they have been assimilated, until the Thing decides to take over the host's actions, or (3) the victims retain consciousness while being assimilated from within. Several of these mechanisms seem possible, depending on how assimilation occurs, as evidenced in the movie.In the film, evidence is pretty strong in regards to the first theory. It is stated that the Thing, even smaller parts of it (such as blood or Norris spider head), have an interest in self-preservation. This suggests that any actions taken by an infected life form, such as the dog fleeing the Norwegian camp or the Thing planting evidence to frame MacReady, are deliberate actions by the Thing to preserve itself. The Thing perfectly mimics its victim and waits until it has the best opportunity to attack another life form or simply has no choice. The dog-Thing does not attack at the camp until it is isolated with the other dogs, all of which are snarling and presumably about to attack the dog-Thing (dogs having a highly developed sense of smell, and possibly having smelled that this dog-Thing is no real dog). The Norris-Thing does not reveal itself until it is on the table with the defibrillator being applied to its chest. The electric shock of the defibrillator may have been seen as an attack by the Thing. The Palmer-Thing does not reveal itself until the moment when MacReady tests its blood with the hot wire, attacking because it knows it will soon be burned otherwise. The Blair-Thing likewise avoids the other men until it finally reveals itself when it is confronted in the bunker. All situations suggest the possibility that the Thing has entirely assimilated life forms and is imitating them until forced to reveal itself. The computer simulation created by Blair suggests the Thing can replicate by attacking, consuming and replicating cells, presumably using the DNA and material from the attacked life form to reform itself and thus make multiple imitations (clones) of itself.However, in an interview on the Thing DVD special features, Charles Hallahan (Norris) points to the scene in which the men appoint MacReady as leader of the group following Windows' attempt to retrieve a shotgun from storage. Norris, who is presumably the Thing at this point, is originally offered the role of leader by Garry but declines stating that he doesn't believe he is up for it. Hallahan states that he always believed Norris knew at this point something was wrong with him and refused the offer because of the slight feeling that he may be the Thing, which directly supports the second theory. Norris later has a heart attack, which could be seen as an element of the real Norris and his heart condition or it could have been a ploy by the Norris-Thing to attempt to gain isolation from the group. It should be noted though that one of the co-producers of the film, Stuart Cohen, expressed surprise at Hallahan for this theory and said it had never been discussed. Therefore it can be assumed that this was only Hallahan's thinking and does not chime with the intentions of the film makers themselves. Of course, it is also possible that The Thing was acting as Norris would in an attempt to remain hidden as long as possible, and that Norris would have turned down the offer of the gun if he hadn't already been assimilated. In regards to the first theory, if Norris was assimilated at this point and aware that he really was the Thing, the real reason why he turned down Garry's offer to be leader of the group is because, as the Thing, he was acting out of self preservation and did not want to attract any more attention to himself.According to the third theory, it is possible that, if an organism is infected with cells of a Thing, it would be conscious while it is being assimilated from the inside. This theory implies that assimilation normally occurs through infection with a few cells that slowly start to multiply and assimilate the host cells inside. This would explain how Blair (and possibly Fuchs) got infected during the alien autopsy. If Norris was also infected this way, then his actions (i.e: refusing a leadership position) are explainable. If this theory is correct, then assimilation would normally be a slow process; the host could become aware of his infection and attempt to take action against the Thing, possibly making his condition known in order to be destroyed along with the Thing. There is a possibility that Fuchs noticed he was being taken over and, therefore, killed himself. Alternatively, if assimilation needs to proceed quicker, then the Thing simply attacks its victim to cause more infections. This means that the host's cells are taken over much faster, and assimilation occurs almost immediately (as per the first theory). This may be what we see during the assimilation of Windows by Palmer-Thing; as he is bitten and is almost instantly taken over.Regardless of theory, it is clear that the Thing becomes capable of controlling the assimilation of the host, retains their memories and skills, and uses them in whatever way possible to its advantage.",
            "The best explanation is that it was far too early; the Norwegian threat (for the Thing) had been eliminated, and it was safe for now. It probably wanted to scope out the entire camp before going after anyone; look for isolated parts of the camp that would be good to assimilate other victims. The Thing may have also considered that, in the event it was discovered, Clark would be a liability because of his seclusion with the dog. In an interview on the Thing DVD, Richard Masur calls Clark the red herring in the script. The Thing is smart, almost as if it is playing chess with the men in the camp. It knows how to misdirect suspicion on the un-assimilated, to keep suspicion away from those who were assimilated. Therefore suspicion would definitely be on Clark because of his isolation with the dog, leaving it free to assimilate someone not suspected while all eyes were fixed on Clark. Also, the Thing may have simply been biding its time. It decided to stay hidden until it was alone with Palmer or Norris, and then again when locked in the cage with the other dogs. It waits for a few moments, thinking it's completely secluded and able to assimilate all the other dogs, then having significantly more numbers on its side. Unfortunately for the Thing, Clark heard the commotion as did MacReady, leading everyone in the camp to discover it.",
            "This could possibly be an error of continuity from a directing standpoint since it could have been several seconds rather than a few seconds between the shots. However, there are a few possible explanations. First, the men could really have had that much confidence that the Thing had been killed that quickly. After all, that would be enough to kill any earth-based lifeform. They had fear that the flames could catch other things on fire, such as the wooden planks on the ceiling of the dog kennel that the Thing grabs on to. This is supported by the scene later on where Mac burns the Norris-Thing creature in the MedLab, the others immediately run and grab extinguishers but Mac tells them to wait until the burning Norris-Thing stops moving. About 10 seconds later, the men again ask Mac to let them put out the fire and he screams at them: \"Just wait!\" as Mac figured out that it takes a lot of fire to kill the things and just setting them on fire and then extinguishing the flames right away does nothing. Third, they might have acted on instinct. Another aspect is that, in the conditions of the Antarctic weather, fire is the greatest hazard to life as shown by the final scenes. In this situation a fire that could potentially destroy the base would have been perceived as the greatest danger facing them before the reality of the Thing had been appreciated.",
            "Childs claims to have seen Blair outside. It seemed like a rational statement, as he knew for sure there were only three other people still alive and one person who they were not certain about. Since the other three survivors had left in a group, the one isolated individual walking away might have been the Blair-Thing, having escaped from the shack. Also, moments after the group see Childs run out of the base, the power goes out, suggesting Childs did see Blair. Of course, all of the survivors were both under a lot of stress as well as exhausted and sleep-deprived, which would have made it harder for them to think clearly, so it's possible that Childs was hallucinating or that his mind was otherwise playing tricks on him. It's interesting to note; when the group goes to give Blair the test, there is a long ominous shot of the facility. The camera pans into the coat room where Childs was guarding, Childs is gone, the door has been left open and snow had begun to build up at the entrance. Moments later, Nauls sees Childs run outside. It's possible Childs was attacked and assimilated, and we see the now-infected Childs run off into the storm. It's also possible that Childs was searching all around the facility for Blair and we simply see him running through a corridor.",
            "As with pretty much every other question, we don't know. In his final scenes, Fuchs chases a shadow when the lights in the lab blow out and he runs outside where he discovers a torn piece of clothing on the ground with MacReady's name sewn on it. Later, MacReady, Windows, and Nauls find his body in the snow where he is dead and his body is burned to a crisp. Whether or not he burned himself or the Thing burned him is hard to say. It is possible that he burns himself upon learning that MacReady could be a Thing after discovering the ripped jacket. He could have burned himself if the Thing had come to attack him. The Thing could have burned him just as a way of getting rid of him. After discovering Fuchs' dead body, MacReady and Nauls head up to MacReady's shack to look around when they see the lights on inside after MacReady had claimed to have turned them off when he left the shack a day ago. Nauls returns alone claiming to have found a torn jacket with MacReady's name on it stuffed in MacReady's oil furnace in the shack (the same torn piece of clothing that Fuchs found on the ground just before his death).Possibilities include:(1) Fuchs burned himself after discovering MacReady may be infected. Fuchs may have done this out of fear and confusion. Perhaps the Thing was setting him up as the person who was supposed to expose MacReady. If Fuchs had burned himself, it would explain why the Thing had to re-plant the evidence (the torn piece of clothing with MacReady's name stamped on it) in Mac's shack.(2) Fuchs killed himself by setting himself on fire with the lighted flare he had after a near-attack from the Thing who either followed him outside or was already outside waiting for him. The Thing may have tried to attack Fuchs, and in response Fuchs killed himself to prevent that from happening. This would also explain the evidence being re-planted. An intriguing variation on this theory is that Fuchs realized he himself was being taken over. It's been shown earlier that when a Thing is discovered, it will reveal itself and try to take action, so why would a self-realization not trigger the same reaction. The logic here is that Fuchs somehow realized he had been taken over or at least deduced some reason why there was a good chance of him being taken over. Then either the part of him already assimilated opted to change tactics to \"hostile takeover\" (similar to what happened to Bennings) or he simply decided to keep the process from being completed. Either way, he stopped it the only way he could, by lighting himself on fire.(3) Fuchs was murdered. The Thing may have killed Fuchs to make sure that there were no scientific minds capable of forming a test, as Blair was locked up and Copper had been drugged. It would have been easy to do; Fuchs was holding a lit flare, so dousing him in fuel would have probably done it. But possibility #3 (this) leads to another unanswered question; why not assimilate him? Fuchs was gone for an extended period of time, and it would have made the men very suspicious. It is important to note that a scene, though never released, details Fuchs as being impaled by a shovel, which would suggest one of the Things killed him. Another possibility is that Norris and Palmer (who were later revealed to be the Things) are seen with flamethrowers. It is possible that one of them got a hold of Mac's jacket and after ripping it he planned on placing it somewhere to frame Mac. But after Fuchs saw him (his shadow), he quickly threw Mac's jacket on the snow, maybe to lure Fuchs out in the open so he could have a better shot at killing him with a flamethrower.(4) Fuchs accidentally burned himself to death while attempting to fight a Thing.Think to the Norwegian camp, Mac and Copper find a frozen body, sat in a chair, with his wrists and throat slashed. Someone who clearly decided they'd rather die than risk infection (the prequel shows who this character was, but still doesnt show why he committed suicide, although there is a deleted scene that shows it). This may have been meant as a parallel to Fuchs.",
            "During the blood test, Mac places a needle in Palmer's blood, causing a Thing to jump out of the tray. However, this particular Thing is never destroyed as the men are distracted by the Palmer-Thing revealing itself. The Palmer's Blood-Thing probably attempted to remain hidden. Also, we did see that the Burned Corpse-Thing did have enough cellular activity left to infect Bennings, and so it's not impossible that a small piece of it broke off and hid for its own survival. In fact, given that \"Splitface\" survived being burned alive, it's not impossible that some cellular activity is still left in the remains of the Bennings-Thing or Fuchs (assuming he was infected before being burned). However, it is equally possible that any of the aforementioned Things were destroyed when the base was. Also, if the blood creature wasn't destroyed when the base was, it would likely freeze very quickly. We know the Thing can survive being frozen, and a small puddle of blood would likely go undiscovered. (It was however too small to be intelligent, reacting on instinct only; this is why the blood test could expose it in the first place.)It is also unknown if the frozen suicide victim in the Norwegian camp was infected or if any other thing samples of remnants were left in labs or frozen in the surrounding area. A deleted scene in the 2011 prequel shows this man killing himself to avoid assimilation; the particular Thing he feared was a smaller, scuttling organism that is never accounted for. It never appeared when Mac visited the ruined Norwegian camp, perhaps suggesting that it had frozen by then (but it would be very much viable if ever thawed). Then there is the spaceship itself, which may have numerous thing corpses or samples aboard.",
            "The movie itself is somewhat vague on the exact timeframe, but it seems to take place roughly over the course of a few days, though exactly how many is unclear. Note that when Mac is recording his tape, he mentions that the storm has been hitting them for roughly 48 hours. The storm in question seems to start some time on the second night, meaning that by the time Mac made his recording, a period equivalent to three days must have passed (assuming his estimate was correct). This would mean that by the end of the movie at least four or five days have passed since the opening scene.Chronologically, it goes something like this:-Day One: The opening scene of the film where Lars and Matias arrive at Outpost 31 (the same point at which the prequel left off). Mac and Copper go to investigate the Norwegian base and find the Burned Corpse-Thing, which Blair attempts to examine unsuccessfully. The dog-Thing also reveals itself in the evening, and Blair performs a more successful autopsy.-Day Two: Mac, Norris, and Palmer investigate the crater, discovering the UFO. Fuchs starts to discover that something's going on when Blair refuses to leave his room. Bennings is suddenly infected, leading to the burning of Splitface and the remains of the dog-Thing. Blair finally snaps, leading him to destroy everything, and is subsequently locked up in the tool shed.-Day Three: The men also discover that the blood bags have been tampered with, leaving Garry, Copper, and Clark as the primary suspects. It's about this point that Mac begins to take over. Also somewhere between Day Two and Day Three the snowstorm begins. Mac begins working with Fuchs to try and find an alternative test to figure out who is human and who is a Thing. Some time late at night, Fuchs mysteriously disappears.-Day Four or Five: Mac records his tape. (Assuming his calculations are correct and the storm started late Day Two, this would have happened late on Day Five.) A lengthy search finally reveals the burned corpse of Fuchs. Nauls finds Mac's torn clothes in his shack, leading him to become a prime suspect. Norris has a heart attack and kills Copper. Clark is shot. Mac figures out a blood test before deciding that the best course of action is to blow up the camp.From a filmmaking standpoint, the gradual confusion in how much time has passed (whether it was intentional or not) could be argued as a clever and subtle means of capturing how the characters (all exhausted, sleep-deprived, scared, and confused) feel in their situation.",
            "This is one of many things the film leaves ambiguous. Presumably the dog-Thing infects whoever the shadow belonged to. Now in the film there are four people confirmed to be infected before the blood test. Bennings, Norris, Palmer and Blair. Bennings can be ruled out because he was found in the middle of his transformation. That leaves three possible candidates- Norris, Palmer or Blair. While both the film and the original short story \"Who Goes There?\" were vague on when exactly Blair was infected, the shadow does not appear to match his appearance. (Note that the figure appears to be tall and thin, unlike Blair's large and portly structure.) Also, the shadow seems to have a full head of hair, whilst Blair has a receding hairline. Therefore, Blair can be ruled out as a suspect. Palmer would be the logical choice for assimilation because the Thing knows he is a helicopter pilot (the dog-Thing has heard him volunteer to fly Copper to the Norwegian camp but Garry sends Mac instead) and is therefore best suited to help it escape. Also he is a fairly quiet, reclusive character who generally does not draw attention, making it easier for the Thing to work undetected. The scene was originally shot using David Clennon but the shadow was thought too recognisable and was re-shot using a stunt actor named Dick Warlock, whose body structure was vaguely similar to that of David Clennon (Palmer) and Charles Hallahan (Norris).",
            "Fuchs just felt Mac was the one most likely to be trustworthy. From Blair's notes he knew the Thing could have taken over anyone, but deduced that Mac had not been infected and felt he could trust him, which is why they work so closely together afterwards. As paranoia sunk in, Fuchs even became suspicious/fearful of Mac, as evidenced by his tense reaction (grabbing a vial of acid) when Mac approached him in his lab. This could have also been the intention behind the Thing leaving MacReady's torn clothes for Fuchs to find- since he would think Mac was a Thing, therefore breaking his trust and leaving him with nobody else to go to - resulting in him either panicking and accidentally lighting himself in the process or burning himself because he saw no other way to avoid being infected.",
            "While Childs keeps watch over the camp, Mac, Garry, and Nauls head out to the shed to give the blood test to Blair but discover the door open and Blair missing. They blow up the spaceship that Blair was making under the shed then set out to blow up the rest of the camp so that the Thing can't escape or resort to freezing itself again. As Garry attempts to plant dynamite in the storage room, Blair suddenly attacks and kills him. Mac and Nauls plant their dynamite in the generator room. Nauls wanders into another room and is not seen again. Suddenly, the floor boards are ripped up, and the Blair-Thing reaches through to get Mac. Mac tosses a lighted stick of dynamite at it, blowing up the Thing and the building. With the whole camp now in flames, Mac takes a seat outside. He is joined by Childs who has been out of sight for several minutes and claims that he went looking for Blair. In the final scene, they sit together, wary of each other, waiting for the fires to die down and the bitter cold Antarctic winter to overtake them.",
            "The mother of all questions. Answer: Mac or Childs or both or neither. In other words? unknown. It is as reasonable to assume that Childs is the Thing as much as it is to assume he is human. There is certainly enough time for him to be assimilated, but he does have an alibi. He claims he saw Blair out in the snow, and since MacReady ordered him to kill Blair, if Blair came back without the others, he was merely following orders. It is not hard to believe Childs' explanation; Garry, Nauls, and Mac had been gone for a good amount of time during their visit to the tool shed to look for Blair, and all of the men were sleep-deprived. Had Childs been a Thing at the end, he could have easily torched Mac with the flamethrower that he was armed with.One case that could be made towards Childs being human involves taking into account the information given in the prequel, where it is revealed that the Thing cannot replicate inorganic material (i.e. piercings, fillings, joint replacements). While this fact is never confirmed in the John Carpenter film, there is no evidence denying it apart from the scene where Nauls is killed by a Box-Thing (which was never shot and is therefore not canon). If you look closely in the final scene, Childs has an earring. Taking this logic into account it would be almost definitive proof that he is still human, since if he were a Thing he would have spat out the earring. The only possible explanation for this is that the Thing learned from its previous experiences and so whenever possible would attempt to replace visible inorganic material such as earrings. However, if Childs was infected, and spat out the earring, it could easily have been lost depending on his location (if he were outside at the time, it could have gotten buried in the snow; if Blair had assimilated him inside the coat room, it could have rolled under something). It's also worth mentioning that the men at Outpost 31 were not aware of this fact, so they would not have questioned him suddenly removing it. Also the remaining men were sleep-deprived and probably not thinking clearly, so they probably wouldn't have noticed the missing earring anyway, let alone question it. Therefore, it seems strange that the Childs-Thing would get down on the ground and waste its time looking for an earring for three reasons:(1) As mentioned previously, most likely nobody would have bothered questioning it, since much like how Kate never had any experiences that led her to realize the Thing's cells function independently, Mac never experienced anything leading him to conclude that the Thing could not replicate inorganic material.(2) Getting down and searching for the earring would leave him vulnerable, as someone could theoretically sneak up on him and attack him while he is not looking. Also he would have a hard time explaining why he is searching so desperately when there are more pressing matters at hand.(3) There was really no need to do a perfect impression of anyone anymore. By this point, Mac was the only other survivor, and he was incredibly weak, freezing to death, and unarmed (Kurt Russell said that he had a torch/flamethrower under his coat during that scene), meaning that Childs could have easily assimilated him, and Mac would be powerless to stop him. The fact that he doesn't would strongly suggest that he is still human.If we wanted to make a case that Childs was the Thing, we could say that when Childs saw Blair out in the storm he was being lured into being assimilated. The Thing got into the camp by getting Childs to open the door, and it got Childs in the process. It then kept Childs away from danger until the situation was over, like protecting the queen in a chess game. When Childs says, \"What will we do?\" Mac suggests they should maybe do nothing. The way Mac is watching and smiling at Childs suggests that Mac is almost certain Childs is the enemy and has won, but Mac accepts the defeat gracefully, and honorably, and even extends his bottle to Childs, so they can drink together. This could be seen as a big developmental leap for Mac, since the first opponent we saw him lose to was the chess computer, and he immaturely destroyed that opponent when he lost the game by pouring his drink into it and calling it a cheating bitch. Interestingly, in the novelization of the film by Alan Dean Foster, the book ends with Mac initiating a chess game with Childs.Was Mac infected? There are theories that he was, but the evidence points to \"no\". Mac passes the blood test, and the possibility of him rigging it and managing to cheat his way out are very slim. Also, had he been infected, he would have most likely only taken one man with him to Blair's shed. This way Mac would be able to assimilate another victim. It is also hard to believe that Mac would kill Blair had he been a Thing. Had MacReady been a Thing before the blood test, he could have killed the remaining humans. Instead of tying up Palmer, he could have had Palmer tie everyone down, and while Nauls, Garry, Childs, and Windows were strapped down, could have burned or assimilated all of them. The fact that he does not do this suggests strongly that he is human.Are both infected? Again, probably not. Some say the dialogue is awkward and cryptic, but there's no strong evidence whatsoever to assume this. The theory of Mac being infected because he gives Childs the bottle and then laughs is not strong; we never see the Thing employ the \"single-cell assimilation\" technique at all during the film, and we don't even know if it's possible. His actions are not strange; Mac had previously acknowledged that no one was going to survive. He says to Nauls and Garry, \"We're not getting out of here alive, but neither is that Thing.\" Two comic book sequels were made in which Childs and Mac survive, pursued by the Thing. At the end of the second comic it is revealed that Childs is the creature. Whether or not these comics are canon is unclear. There is also a PS2 video game which carried on where the original film left off. In the initial scenes of the game Childs' body is found indicating that he was human. His cause of death is not made clear. At the end of the game the main character is rescued by a presumably human Mac flying yet another helicopter. Together they defeat a huge and grotesque incarnation of the Thing.",
            "Yes, two alternate endings were shot, although only one has been seen. The first is a shot of the camp the next day, burned to the ground with billows of smoke rising into the air. In the distance we see a dog running away from the camp. The dog stops and turns, looks at the camp, then continues to run again. The second ending is mentioned on the DVD but has never been used. It showed MacReady in an office with evidence that he has just taken and passed a blood test. This sequence was shot for safety because of the downbeat ending, but was never shown to audiences, not even in test screenings.",
            "The fates of MacReady and Childs are intentionally left open for the viewer to speculate on. The most logical answer would be that they both froze to death, seeing as their only source of heat was their burning base, whose fires probably would have died out by the morning. It was already established that the rescue team wouldn't be able to make it, and MacReady seemed to be aware that this was going to happen towards the end. However, some have argued that one (or both) of the survivors are actually Things. Childs could have been infected while he was searching for Blair, though this raises the question of why he does not attack the isolated and defenseless MacReady.There are two alternate endings of the film which hint towards two different fates of the characters. One had MacReady in an office some time later with evidence showing that he is still human, which would mean that he survived, although as the scene has never been shown, it is not known if it would have indicated Childs to have survived as well. The other alternate ending shows the camp burned, and a dog (presumably a Thing) escaping, and since it does not attack either of the two survivors, it would probably mean they had frozen to death during the night. John Carpenter mentioned that if he ever did a sequel, it would have MacReady and Childs being rescued by a team alerted via a transmission Windows was able to get out before Blair went crazy. He would blame the aging of Kurt Russell and Keith David on their characters' exposure to the elements. This would suggest that the man who made this film intended them to survive.A number of unofficial continuations exist which have suggested different fates of the characters. The video game, for example, implies Childs to have died but reveals that Mac survived. There is also a series of comics in which Mac and Childs are rescued but the latter is revealed to be a Thing. In the DVD commentary for The Thing (2011) the writers/directors/producers postulate that Kate, the sole survivor from the end of that film will make her way to the US base via a snowcat in pursuit of the dog and arrive in time to rescue MacReady and Childs. The 2011 film also establishes that knowledge of the spaceship's discovery has extended beyond Antarctica so it is possible others are on their way to investigate and may save them. Outpost 31, the official The Thing fansite had a number of fan fiction stories which have tried to continue where the film left off. See here. The nature of the stories vary, and point towards different fates for the characters. The story \"The Tape\" reveals that Childs froze to death but leaves Mac's fate open. \"The Thing EX: An Alternate Ending\" reveals that Childs and Mac both froze to death (although a UFO is reported to have been found, suggesting one of them was infected). \"The Aftermath\" sees Mac and Childs return to the Norwegian base only for it to be revealed that Mac is a Thing and he's been infecting Childs through a bottle of whiskey. \"The Thing II: Contagion\" reveals that both Mac and Childs were rescued, but one of them is infected and accidentally spreads through another base, and the story ends with the implication that Mac froze to death in the Antarctic Ocean. \"Unfinished Buisiness\" takes a slightly more optimistic approach, revealing Mac and Childs to be rescued by a Russian expedition team who saw the explosions; both are revealed to be human and spend most of the story working to figure out how to destroy the Thing once and for all.",
            "Bennings: The group store the presumed dead, Burnt Corpse-Thing (a.k.a. Splitface) that Mac and Copper found at the Norwegian base. Bennings goes into the storage room to get some of his things out, and Splitface attacks him while his guard is down. Windows goes back to witness the Thing assimilating Bennings. The rest of the group find the Bennings-Thing outside trying to escape. Mac dumps a drum of fuel onto the Bennings-Thing and lights him on fire with a flare.Fuchs: Arguably the most mysterious death in the film. Fuchs is in his lab when the power goes out. He sees someone walk by and follows them outside with a flare to light his way. He finds some shredded clothing that have MacReady's name on them. Mac, Nauls and Windows go outside and find the charred remains of a body they assume is Fuchs. They all speculate that he either burned himself before he could be assimilated, tried to burn a Thing and accidentally burned himself or the Thing burned him.Copper: While trying to resuscitate Norris, his arms get bitten off by the Norris-Thing and he presumably dies from a combination of shock, loss of blood, and possibly also smoke inhalation (as everyone is trying to get away from the Norris-Thing, while Copper is still left lying nearby as there was no chance for anyone to get to him without being attacked combined with the fact that Mac let the Thing burn as long as possible). Mac tests Copper's blood regardless and it's revealed he was still human.Norris: After trying to subdue Mac, Norris has a heart attack and collapses. Copper shocks him with a defibrillator in order to try and resuscitate him to no avail. When Copper tries again, Norris' stomach rips open revealing him to be a Thing filled with Razor-sharp teeth and Copper's arms slip into the stomach-mouth and get bitten off. Mac burns Norris' body with a flamethrower. Norris' head detaches to try and escape but Palmer brings it to Mac's attention. So Mac finishes off the Norris-Head-Thing with the flamethrower.Clark: tries to stab Mac with a scalpel, but Mac shoots him in the forehead before he's able. Mac tests his blood even though he was dead and he was still human.Palmer: Discovered to be a Thing during Mac's blood test. He breaks free from his restraints and starts attacking Windows. Mac manages to burn the Palmer-Thing and finish him off with a stick of dynamite.Windows: When Palmer-Thing is discovered it escapes its restraints, fires a tentacle at Windows and pulls Windows' head into the thing's mouth and proceeds to attack him before Palmer-Thing throws him against a wall. Once Mac deals with the Palmer-Thing, he comes back inside to see Windows being infected and becoming a Thing. So Mac finishes him off with the flamethrower.Garry: Goes with Mac and Nauls into the basement to rig explosives. He is attacked by the Blair-Thing, who sticks its hand into Garry's face and bonds directly with his face and kills him. He is then dragged off camera and presumably consumed.Nauls: Heads to the basement to rig explosives with Mac and Garry. He wanders off alone to find a place to plant his explosives. He hears a strange noise and he isn't seen again but the Blair-Thing is seen attacking from the area in which Nauls had been, implying he was killed quick and quietly.Blair: Seemingly goes crazy and cuts off the group from the outside world by destroying the snow-cats, the helicopter, the radio equipment, etc. He claims he did this so The Thing couldn't be rescued and brought to civilization but it's also possible he was infected and did this so he could assimilate as many of the group as possible before their eventual rescue. The group lock him up in a tool shed away from them so he couldn't do any more damage. The survivors go back out to check on him and find that he had become or always was a Thing and had burrowed a small cave underneath the snow and had been building a small craft to escape the camp. The survivors track him down to the basement of the installation and rig the whole base to explode. MacReady kills the Blair-Thing with a stick of dynamite which also sets off the rest of the bombs destroying the majority of the installation.Childs: Survives the events of the film (though it has been argued that he was assimilated by the Blair-Thing, and it is possible that he froze to death).R.J. MacReady: Survives the events of the film (though it is a possibility that he froze to death some time afterward).",
            "Three main theories in this regard. The most commonly accepted theory, which is the one mainly suggested in the film itself, is that either by its inherent nature or conscious choice it wants to take over the world and transform all lifeforms, that in effect it is an invader/parasite. A different theory is that it is not actually hostile at all, it simply wants to survive and go home, which is given credence by Blair's construction of his improvised spaceship in his lair. A less common third theory is that the Thing is actually a form of scientific researcher and investigates new planets and lifeforms by assimilating a sample of them.",
            "The base was only equipped with a few basic weapons. A handgun, a few shotguns and two or three flamethrowers. While the creature was attacking the dogs, Mac sends Bennings to get Childs and the flamethrower in case they'd need it. After they fired on it with the shotguns and handgun, seeing that it didn't do any damage, Mac orders Childs to torch it figuring it'd be the best bet. Mac also had seen evidence of the Norwegians using fire against the Thing. He had seen the \"Splitface\" corpse at the Norwegian camp, which had been burned with kerosene. The Norwegians who arrived at the camp earlier were attempting to use thermite grenades against the dog, and their helicopter was loaded with kerosene containers. These hints from the Norwegians probably led him to believe that fire would be a successful weapon against the Thing. He didn't just jump straight to \"flamethrower!\" with no evidence.",
            "The Thing (2011) is a prequel that was released on October 14th 2011 which chronicles the events at the Norwegian camp. The ending of the prequel is right when this film starts. There was also The Thing (2002), a video game released in 2002 which serves as a sequel to this film. It told the story of a special forces team sent in to investigate Outpost 31 and had some similarities to the \"Resident Evil\" storyline (a greedy corporation wanting to use the Thing as a bio-weapon). MacReady makes an appearence towards the end of the game. In addition there was also another sequel in the form of a comic book series in the early 1991 called \"The Thing From Another World\" by Dark Horse. This title was designed to distinguish it from the Marvel character, The Thing (of Fantastic Four fame). This story followed on from the 1982 film and involved a Navy SEAL team rescuing MacReady who had managed to get separated from Childs. One of the SEAL team is infected by a sea-lion before MacReady is brought back to a military base that he eventually escapes from. When Childs finally shows up he too is later infected. The comics ran for four series.The Sci Fi Channel planned a 4 hour mini-series sequel in 2003. John Carpenter stated that he believed the project should proceed, but the Sci Fi Channel later removed all mention of the project from their homepage. In February 2009, a positive review of the abandoned screenplay for the Sci-Fi miniseries was published on Corona's Coming Attractions. In 2004, Carpenter said in an Empire magazine interview that he has a story idea for The Thing II, which centers around the two surviving characters, MacReady and Childs. However, Carpenter felt that due to the higher price associated with his fee, Universal Studios will not pursue his storyline. Carpenter indicated that he would be able to secure both Kurt Russell and Keith David for the sequel. In his story, Carpenter would explain the age difference of the actors between the two installments by having frostbite on their face due to the elements until rescued. The assumption of the sequel would rely on a radio-signal being successfully transmitted by Windows before Blair destroyed the communications room. Thus, after the explosion of the base camp, the rescue team would arrive and find MacReady and Childs still alive.",
            "Seeing as how the novel is a short story and published in 1938, there are a significant amount of differences. However the essence of the book is captured in the film and it is more faithful than the 1951 version.The film updates the setting from the 1930s (around the time the book was published) to what was then present-day in 1982 (the year the film was released).In the novel, the American team discover the ship and the Thing, there are no Norwegians, and when the ship is uncovered by the thermite charges it is accidentally destroyed.In the novel, they deduce the ship had crashed on Earth ten million years ago. Whereas in the film, it was only 100,000 years.In the novel there are 37 people stationed at the camp, in this film there are only 12. This may have been done for a number of practical reasons. First, it simplifies the narrative, as in a two-hour film it is easier to develop a smaller cast, not to mention it makes it easier for the audience to learn to identify every character by face. This also may have been done to heighten the drama, as it becomes far more tense when a small group of people who have been working together for months are turned against each other by their paranoia.MacReady, Bennings, Clark, Norris, Blair, Copper, and Garry all appear in the novel as their same characters, though Bennings is called \"Benning\", MacReady is spelled \"McReady\" and he's Garry's second-in-command. Whereas in the film, Mac is simply a helicopter pilot who assumes the role of the leader when Garry is suspected of being infected.The book is slightly vague on the action sequences (likely in an attempt not to be too gruesome by 1930s standards) but the attack on the dog kennel is in the book as well as the film. Here, the first Thing to be discovered is killed by electricity.In the book, electricity is used as the primary means of destroying the Thing. In the film, the characters rely largely on fire in the form of flares and flamethrowers, and in the case of Palmer and Blair, dynamite. This might be just to add a sense of realism, as the original book implied the device used to electrify the Thing was something the crew had thrown together before hand, while flamethrowers are a more practical tool used in Antarctic stations for melting ice.In the book, Blair was very eager to thaw out the Thing and once it gets loose, he has a complete nervous breakdown. The group isolate him immediately, the sequence of events take much longer in the film.In the novel, the group conclude that they need to isolate themselves and pretend everything is normal over the radio to avoid any rescue attempts until the Thing is discovered and dealt with. In the film, Blair takes it upon himself to isolate the group and the radio had been dead before they realized they had any problems.In the book, it's theorized (and ultimately implied) that the Thing is telepathic and can read everyone's thoughts and memories which is why it's able to perfectly imitate anybody including their personalities. In the film, this is never mentioned or theorized. It is more or less implied that when the Thing takes over someone, it's simply an exact copy of them down to the very last detail, including thoughts and memories, which is why Norris still has a heart condition even though he's a Thing.In the book, Copper comes up with an extremely flawed and rather cruel blood test. A sled dog is conditioned by human blood injections to provide a human-immunity serum test, as in rabbits, which ultimately proves inconclusive because the dog had already been infected. In the film, Copper comes up with a blood serum test of mixing each person's blood with uncontaminated blood.In the book, it is implied that the infected people don't know they're Things. In the film, this is a possibility but given the maneuvering the Thing does, the infected people DO know they are not human.In the book, more and more people start becoming paranoid and having mental breakdowns due to not knowing if anyone else is human. Ultimately, one of the crew members is murdered and accidentally revealed to be a Thing which gives McReady the idea for his blood test. In this movie, MacReady comes up with his blood test after seeing how the Norris-Thing's head detached from its body in an attempt to save itself.In the film, Clark and Garry aren't infected (unless you count Blair killing Garry at the end) and Norris is infected. In the book, it's the opposite.The blood test McReady gives is very similar in both the book and the film. Mac's dialogue in the film is almost verbatim from the novel. In the book, everyone takes turns getting tested and when their blood recoils, they're immediately executed and burned. During the blood test, a total of 14 camp members out of the remaining 36 are discovered to be infected and killed, including Garry, Clark and another central character in the novel named Connant. Then a group of the survivors including McReady and Norris go to get Blair and give him the test, where they find he's been building a craft to escape the planet. The group dispatch the creature and that's the end of the novel.Copper, Norris, McReady, and roughly half of the 37 survived to the very end of the book and the creature is defeated, giving the book a happy ending. In the film, 10 of the crew (including Copper and Norris) die for certain, the Thing is presumably defeated, but the last two people, MacReady's and Childs' fates are left ambiguous, leaving the ending bleak and open to interpretation."

            "Likely because he didn't learn the skills to return from the netherworld of the force like Obi-Wan and Yoda did. However, once he died, he likely met with Obi-Wan and Yoda in the force and they showed him how to return.",
            "Palpatine had manipulated Anakin/Vader in to joining him, with the promise of helping Anakin unlock the secret of cheating death. Anakin/Vader had made several horrible, unforgivable choices in desperation. Palpatine then mislead Vader in to thinking he killed Padm\u00e9 himself. By making Vader believe the love of his life died by his own hands, the Emperor was blameless for not being able to help save her. This also left Vader with nothing. Feeling he had no choice, Vader continued to serve the Emperor for the promise of power.",
            "The intention was likely to make it ambiguous at this point as to whether Luke turned to the Dark Side between the events of The Empire Strikes Back and Return Of The Jedi, if only for a short time. Keep in mind, there are specific sounds used in the film to accompany the force choke for the audience to recognise. A deep, sinister rumbling, following by \"crunching\" noises. Neither of which were present when Luke dealt with the Gammoreans. It's possible Luke was actually using a mind trick on them to make them think they were choking.The Grip more than likely can be used at different levels, depending on the wants and needs of the user. A Jedi could use it as more of a choke-out or sleeper hold on antagonists they do not wish to fight even in self-defense. This is likely the way that Luke was intending. He had important business, and making it clear to the Gamorrean guards that he was not the right guy to mess with was not a priority to him.Given what we know of Luke, he would not have killed them. We only see them putting their hands to their throats in the manner associated with usage of The Grip for a second, and we see Luke mere seconds later approaching Jabba's throne room. The best-remembered use of The Grip by Darth Vader in The Empire Strikes Back takes this length of time to kill Admiral Ozzel. This makes it pretty clear that Luke only restricted the Gamorrean guards' air supply long enough to make them get out of his way.",

            "The most important reason is that the Emperor craves power. Vader was older, and is eventually defeated by Luke. Clearly he has lost his effectiveness in combat and likely in the natural intuition that a Jedi or Sith possesses, so a younger apprentice who is just as-if not more-powerful than Vader would prove advantageous to the Emperor.Another, lesser known reason which is not addressed in the movies, but stated in many novelizations, is that Vader's ability to use the Force was greatly reduced upon suffering the injuries which confined him to his survival suit. Therefore, Luke, being the son of Anakin, one of the most powerful Jedi known, would definitely be more powerful, inheriting his father's abilities and with the training he received from Yoda. As George Lucas states in the \"Making of\" book for the third prequel, Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (2005), the Emperor \"will ultimately be disappointed in Anakin,\" and will eventually see Luke (and possibly Leia) as an opportunity to obtain a more powerful apprentice.A third reason which can tie in with the first two is that the Sith habitually follow or are afflicted by \"the Rule of Two\", a name given to a concept expounded upon by Yoda at the end of the first prequel, Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999): \"Always two there are, no more, no less: a master and an apprentice.\" This is due to a Sith Lord's extreme inclination to be possessive of other individuals amidst having obsession with power; and due to competition and betrayal accordingly. (The value that anybody has to a Sith Lord cannot be peacefully shared with a third party.) To have Luke and Vader as his apprentices, especially considering they were father and son, would definitely increase the chance that they would betray and kill the Emperor. Vader even proposes this idea to Luke, in Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980), though that could have just been a ruse to coax Luke to the dark side of the Force, promising him secondary rule of the galaxy. He also suggests overthrowing the Emperor to his wife, in Revenge of the Sith, and ruling the galaxy with her, which was only shortly after he had turned to the dark side.Also (in the Expanded Universe), the Rule of Two involves a provision of which the Emperor was not fond. As the story goes, the Rule of Two came about after thousands of years of the Sith being in power. The Dark Lords of the Sith were vast and there was an unspoken tradition within their ranks that the apprentices would at some point try and kill their masters. Eventually this imploded and the Sith all but destroyed themselves due to the constant paranoia and scheming between masters and apprentices. Eventually, around 1,000 years before the events of the Star Wars plots, the Sith Darth Bane initiated the Rule of Two allowing only one master and one apprentice. The idea being that after the apprentice's training was complete, he or she would challenge their master in open combat. If the apprentice won the duel, they would strike down their master and claim the title for themself, then find their own apprentice. On the flip-side, if the apprentice lost the duel, they were unworthy of the title of Sith Master, and the master would find a replacement; the idea being that no matter what, the Sith would always become stronger with each master and apprentice. Clearly the Emperor was not fond of Bane's idea, because he manipulated Anakin/Vader in such a way that Vader never found a sincere motivation to overthrow the Emperor after it was thought that his wife and his child were killed. Vader's only desire was to become more powerful through the dark side of the Force. So the Emperor only gave him small bits of training over the years to keep Vader enticed. The Emperor then gets Vader and Luke to duel each other, the victor being intended to be the Emperor's apprentice.",
            "In the end (as Luke said), his overconfidence was the Emperor's weakness. Even with all his meticulous planning, the one thing he did not expect was for the tiny, primitive, and (in his opinion) insignificant native creatures of Endor's moon, called Ewoks, to assist the \"insignificant\" Rebels in capturing the base and ambushing the Imperial stormtroopers, and he may very well have been completely unaware of their presence at all. If the Ewoks had not been there, or had not helped the Rebels' infantry, the stormtroopers would likely have wiped out the small group of Rebel soldiers. The shield generator would have remained operational, preventing the Death Star from being attacked, and the Rebel fleet would have been defenseless against the Death Star's weapon. The Rebel-Ewok alliance allowed the Rebels to destroy the shield generator and attack the internal structure of the Death Star.Even if the Emperor's plan had succeeded, Luke would have refused to join the dark side after defeating Vader. In the Emperor's infinite arrogance, he also let his guard down near Vader, not expecting Vader to throw him over the ledge of the reactor shaft, killing him. So even if the Rebel Alliance had been destroyed, the Emperor likely would not have lived long enough to reap the rewards.When Luke refused to fight Vader, the Rebels were losing, but when he confronted him and refused loyalty to the Emperor, the tide of the battle changed. Luke was perhaps representing the understated light side of the Force, in the battle between the dark side of the Force and this light side-\"the good side.\" Had Luke lost or joined the dark side; going by the mystique aspect, the dark side and the Empire (the latter representing the former) would have gained the upper hand and defeated the Rebels. In some of the Expanded Universe, some very powerful Jedi have an ability called \"battle meditation\". They can sit in a room and meditate while a fierce battle rages, be it on land or in outer space. When meditating, certain Jedi can influence their allies fighting the battle into having faster reflexes, foresight, etc. So if Luke truly was so powerful; once he embraced the light side (or at the very least, rejected the dark side), he may have influenced the Rebellion's success without even knowing it. The Emperor, with whom the Force was strong, may have been very adept at battle meditation and likely assumed that his own ability to carry it out far surpassed Luke's, again reinforcing how arrogant he had become throughout his career.",
            "No. The story that Lando originally died and had his fate altered to survive after disastrous test screenings is an urban legend. In no released version of the script does he die (nor in \"The Annotated Screenplays\"), and both Jedi writer Lawrence Kasdan and Lando actor Billy Dee Williams have dismissed this rumour. The IGN review of the Star Wars Trilogy box set is incorrect in saying that Lando originally did not make it out in time when Death Star exploded. There were never any test screenings of the film. However, Harrison Ford did strongly argue with Lucas that his character, Han Solo, should die, quoting himself as having said, \"He's got no momma, no poppa. Let's kill him off and add some weight to this thing.\" Lucas denied Ford his request, preferring to let Han live and have the story end on a much happier note. (In the subsequent novels and other writings of the Expanded Universe; Han and Leia marry and have three children, twins Jaina and Jacen as well as one younger boy, Anakin.)",
            "When the Emperor orders Luke to kill Darth Vader and join him on the Dark Side, Luke refuses, claiming that he is a Jedi, like his father before him. The Emperor retaliates by striking Luke with Force lightning. Not willing to let his son die, Vader tosses the Emperor down the DeathStar reactor shaft, killing him, but Vader is electrocuted in the process. As he lay dying, he asks Luke to remove his mask so that he can look upon his son's face with his own eyes. Meanwhile on Endor, Han and the strike team have successfully destroyed the DeathStar's shield generator, allowing Lando to lead a group of rebel ships into the core and destroy the main reactor. Leia and Han watch the DeathStar] explode, and Han agrees to step back and let her pursue a love relationship with Luke. Leia assures him that, although she does love Luke, she does so because he is her brother. Luke returns to Endor with his father's body, which he cremates on a funeral pyre. In the final scenes, the Rebels and Ewoks celebrate their victory, while the ghosts of Obi-wan, Yoda, and Anakin (Hayden Christensen) look on with pride.",
            "For the 2004 DVD release, Lucas decided to replace the ghost of old Anakin with Hayden Christensen, who at that time was portraying the younger Anakin in Revenge Of The Sith. The principle reason for this change comes down to Anakin's choices in Sith. Lucas is making the statement that when Anakin became Darth Vader, Anakin's Jedi spirit was lost. That spirit now appears to Luke in this younger form because Luke has allowed Anakin to fulfill his prophecy and regain his former identity, which takes the physical shape and form that it had before he turned to the dark side of the Force. If image of the old man was retained; it should honestly, considering Anakin's human injuries, be scarred, limbless and deformed. The reason is also possibly because Shaw might appear to be too old in the scene, since Anakin is 46 years old by the end of the film, according to the series' official timeline.In the canon Darth Vader comic book series, there is an inner psychological battle going on in Vader's mind between his present \"Dark Side\" self, and what little \"good\" is left in him representing the \"Light Side\" and the man he once was. His goodness in these \"inner being\" battles is represented by his younger Clone Wars self, before he became Darth Vader, so this would further account for his younger body being the one that becomes the Force Ghost.",
            "Primarily, so as to try and add more of a dramatic effect to the scene. Since we cannot tell Vader's feelings from his face, his sudden intervention seemed to come somewhat out of the blue. The vocal reaction makes it much clearer that he is definitely emotionally struggling behind the mask before making his decision. Plus, the yelling of \"No!\" by a Jedi in response to a death or horrible realization has become something of a trend within the entire saga: Obi-Wan yells it upon Qui-Gon Jinn's death in The Phantom Menace, Anakin while stopping Dooku killing Obi-Wan in Attack of the Clones (and Qui-Gon during Yoda's meditation), Vader in response to hearing of Padm\u00e9's death in Revenge of the Sith, Luke in response to Obi-Wan's death in A New Hope, and finally, Luke upon learning Vader's identity in Empire Strikes Back. It has become somewhat of a series trademark, just as the famous line \"I have a bad feeling about this,\" which features in every movie and many spin-off media."

Once being released from \"Freedom Town\", Tony starts working for Frank within a few weeks of this. We can assume he worked for Frank for about a year before their falling out, then Tony builds his empire. In the scene before the inauguration of the beauty salon, where the Montana Travel Co. building and the \"World is Yours\" fountain are showed, behind the trees, you can see a huge advertisement for the new Corvette C4 in red color. That ad started to be published in late 1983. Then, in the last moments when Tony is in NYC, there's a bus with an advertisement on the side: \"There's only one way to play it\" from Kool Cigarettes, and that ad was last posted in 1984. So the movie covers at least 3.5 years.",
            "In the '32 film, the character is named Tony Camonte, son of Italian immigrants. In the '83 film he's Tony Montana, a direct immigrant from Cuba.In the '32 film Tony has a relatively close relationship with his mother and siblings, and people openly question his affections for his sister Francesca. In the '83 movie, Tony is estranged from his family, his mother despises him and he becomes close with his sister Gina. It is left ambiguous, however, as to whether he had sexual feelings for her.In '32, Tony is a bootlegger of alcohol during prohibition in Chicago. In '83, Tony is a drug kingpin in Miami.In both films, Tony steals his boss' girlfriend (Elvira in '83 and Poppy in '32), which prompts his boss (Frank in '83 and Johnny Lovo in '32) to try and have Tony killed.Tony suspects but can't prove that his boss tried to kill him in both films, so he uses the same ploy to find out by having one of his men call the boss at his office and pretend to be the hitman. The boss' response gives away the fact that they did order the hit. The dialogue is similar in both movies.In both movies, when Tony goes to claim his prize (being the boss' girl). He looks out the window and sees a sign that says \"the world is yours\". In the '32 movie, it is on a billboard. In the '83 movie it is on a passing blimp.There is then a montage of Tony building his empire in both movies, though the '83 film spends much more time with Tony on top of the world (as the movie's runtime is an hour longer than the '32 film).In both movies Tony finds one of his trusted associates with his sister, at which point Tony snaps and kills him, only then discovering that they had just gotten married.In the '32 film, Tony's sister gets over him murdering her husband very quickly and decides to help him make a stand against the police in Tony's second floor apartment hideout. She is shot through the window by the cops. In the '83 film Tony's sister becomes hysterical, starts shooting at Tony, and is gunned down by a hitman hiding on the balcony.In the '32 film, Tony gets into a moderate shoot out with the police before surrendering. As he was walking down the stairs to meet the police, he decides to make a run for it and is shot repeatedly by the police. In the '83 film, Tony is not killed by the police or the feds, but by hit-men from a rival drug cartel. Fueled by rage and cocaine after seeing his sister killed, Tony gears up with his \"little friend\" and gets into one of the bloodiest and most classic shoot-outs in cinema history, killing or wounding more than a dozen Cartel hit-men before taking a double-barreled shotgun to the back by an assassin and falling into his reflection pool in his front lobby.",

            "The cinematic answer is that he'd snorted so much cocaine in the few minutes prior that it gave him the strength to keep upright and taunt his attackers even though they'd riddled him with dozens of bullets. In reality Tony couldn't have possibly remained standing upright despite how much cocaine he'd snorted beforehand. The scene is simply there to add to the fact that Tony has balls of steel.",
            "While it is never fully explained if Omar Suarez (F. Murray Abraham) was in league with Hector the Toad (Al Israel) and the Colombians to kill Tony, or if it was just a coincidence, both Tony and Omar do not like each other when they first meet. Tony later explains to Alejandro Sosa (Paul Shenar) that he never liked or trusted Omar from the very start and suspects that Omar set him up with the drug deal in Miami where Angel Fernandez (Pepe Serna) was killed (with a chainsaw). In the first scene with Tony and Omar, when Manny introduces Tony, Omar offers them both a low-risk job of unloading marijuana from a boat for $500. Tony (clearly acting out of greed) balks at the offer and demands at least $1,000 for the work. The argument nearly turns violent when Omar prepares to pull a gun on Tony, when suddenly Waldo (Santos Morales) (the driver and other man in the car with Omar) stops him and whispers something to Omar which the tail end of it is heard as: \"... he can do the Colombians, man.\" This implies that Omar might have known about the mechanical nature of Hector the Toad (i.e., rumors that Hector savagely kills people who attempt to buy his cocaine in order to steal their money). Waldo was clearly mentioning to Omar that he does not need to threaten Tony, but that if he arranges a cocaine purchase deal with Hector, it may result that Hector and his men would probably kill Tony for them."

            "When Bowman warns Floyd to leave Jupiter's orbit within the next two days, Floyd breaks the communication ban between the Discovery and the Leonov. Aware that the two ships don't have enough fuel to make it back to Earth separately if they leave so many weeks ahead of their launch window, they concoct a plan to attach the Leonov to the Discovery, use the Discovery as a booster rocket, then detach the Discovery and use the Leonov for the return trip. They begin to make the preparations, including reprogramming HAL to accept the new orders, although Dr Chandra isn't sure whether HAL will accept them. Two days later, as they count down to launch, the crew notices that the black spot on Jupiter has suddenly begun to shrink, filling up instead with millions of monoliths. HAL notices, too, and requests that the countdown be stopped so that the phenomenon can be studied, forcing Chandra to be truthful about the Discovery's (and HAL's) imminent destruction. Fortunately, HAL understands and proceeds with the countdown. Just before the Discovery is destroyed, Bowman contacts HAL and orders him to point his transmitter towards the Earth and send the following message: ALL THESE WORLDS ARE YOURS EXCEPT EUROPA. ATTEMPT NO LANDING THERE. USE THEM TOGETHER. USE THEM IN PEACE HAL does as directed and transmits the message until the Discovery blows up. The crew then watches incredulously as Jupiter collapses then explodes, forming a small star. In the final scenes, Floyd composes a letter to his son explaining how the people on Earth will forevermore see two suns in the sky and know that we are not alone. He then goes into cryosleep knowing that the Soviets and the U.S. have, thanks to the message, ceased their hostilities. Meanwhile, centuries later on Europa, the new mini sun has warmed the surface enough to allow vegetation to grow there.

Also, the gun in question, the AMT Hardballer, was notoriously unreliable.3) It may not have needed the sight, but didn't bother to remove it either (the sight is already mounted at the gun shop where the Terminator acquires it).4) It could also allow Terminator to save some energy by not activating its internal gun aiming system.5) The cross hairs in his vision must be there for the purpose of adjusting his eyesight (maybe measuring the distance).

A full-size UZI, especially with the 32-round magazines, is bigger than Reese's shotgun in every dimension that matters in regards to concealing it, even for someone as big as the Terminator. Reese also sawed off the stock of the shotgun and tied a rope to it to sling around his shoulder.

For someone like Sarah those details are horrifying and sharply contrast with what she'd regard as mundane everyday life.",
            "The explanation is given in the novelization as well as the script treatment. Sarah Connor gets killed in 2029, during the war against the machines. Skynet then discovers in a routine autopsy that Sarah Connor had a leg injury that had been present prior to Judgment Day. So later, when Skynet sends a Terminator to *change* the past, the Terminator can positively identify Sarah based on that leg injury, because Skynet thought Sarah got the injury as a child. Unfortunately for Skynet, Sarah got that leg injury when Kyle blew the Terminator in half with a pipe bomb. So Skynet's efforts to change the future in fact preserved it.From the Script Treatment:Vukovick stops the report. Did he hear correctly?

When the Resistance stormed Time Displacement Complex \"the Terminator had already gone through\". Terminators vary in human appearance, so even thought Reese encountered 800 series terminators before (one of them in the bunker scene), he'd never seen this version so he had no clue how this particular one looks like. He knows the technical data of it, but most likely from the data the resistance found in TDE complex.",
            "One of the pellets from Kyle's shotgun blasts got wedged in the hydraulics of the arm. It's also possible the car crash threw a gear out of alignment.

            "The novelization points out the premature tissue necrosis and gangrene and then goes into little more details: All over the cyborg's body there were bruises and abrasions, some of the latter putrid with gangrene. (...) But the flesh was not healing. The room was filled with the cloying odor of decay.\nGangrene is a complication of necrosis or cell death characterized by the decay of body tissues, which become black (and/or green) and malodorous. It is caused by infection or ischemia and it is usually the result of critically insufficient blood supplyThere are three theories about the cause1. Live human tissue dies and starts to rot when substantially damaged2. The human flesh gets infected and weak because of the metal. That would also explain the sweating as being caused by a fever3. There's not enough elements that would help to support and keep the flesh alive. Although the early script treatment says that the terminator does have small organs like 'miniature' stomach, it's not enough. Also, the temperature of the metal keeps heating the flesh, causing it to greatly exceed the natural human body temperature and eventually die. That would mean that the flesh covering isn't perfected yet and lasts only for a certain period of time.4. The flesh would heal if it properly treated the wounds. As we see Sarah do to the Terminator in T2. However, this terminator couldn't be bothered to properly treat and dress its wounds because it felt it was close enough to completing its mission.",
            "Not exactly. In one of the deleted scenes, marked \"Sarah Fights Back\", we find out that both Sarah and Kyle eventually decide on stopping the future from happening and assassinating Cyberdyne Systems. That is why Kyle is preparing explosives for later on in the Motel, and this is why they eventually ended up in Cyberdyne - because they were on the way there, so they were fairly close to it.From the scriptSARAH\nWe can change it, Kyle.

Let's go, kiddo.\nWhaddya say?He picks up her sign and they look at each other for a\nsecond, then get up.",
            "The surviving police likely deduced that the perpetrator who attacked the police station was simply wearing heavy body armour. Something Traxler had suggested to Sarah earlier in the film when she mentioned the Terminator getting up after getting repeatedly shot.As for the truck passenger, his story would be that they ran a man over, the driver got out, then the guy that they ran over, got in the truck. He had a red eye and metal in his skin. His description would likely be dismissed as being confused by the shock of running someone over.Regardless, Kyle Reese was dead by the end of the movie, the Terminator was smashed and then hidden in a cover up. So the evidence of the Terminator could not be confirmed.",
            "The most likely explanation is that in T2, Sarah removed the bullets from the terminator's body, stitched and dressed the wounds. Which is why they would heal.The terminator in this film did dress his arm wound, but didn't take care of his eye. It's likely he would have to patch the eye up and he didn't want to lose 50% of his vision. So without treating the wound, it started to turn gangrenous.",
            "As the gun shop owner says, the Terminator could take the rifles, but there's a waiting period on the handguns (required for a background check on the buyer). The Terminator naturally wasn't going to go through the proper legal channels, such as paying for them or waiting out a background check, in order to obtain his arsenal. Had he stolen the guns by running out of the store and let the owner live, the owner would have called the police and given his description resulting in an APB (All Points Bulletin) for the police to be on the lookout for the thief of the weapons. While this may not be a major obstacle for the Terminator, it would no doubt be a serious inconvenience. Killing the owner allows the Terminator to take everything at once and not leave any witnesses. The Terminator, being an infiltration unit, knows when to kill and when not to.",
            "As Reese tells the police and Dr Silberman (Earl Boen), the terminator was \"just being systematic.\" Skynet had almost no information about John Connor's mother. They knew her name and that she was living in Los Angeles in 1984. The Terminator was methodically carrying out his mission to kill Sarah Connor by going through the phone book and killing every person named Sarah Connor listed. When he gets to Sarah's apartment, she is not there but her roommate Ginger (Bess Motta) is home. The Terminator doesn't know what Sarah Connor looks like, so he kills Ginger just to make sure. When Sarah telephones Ginger, the Terminator hears her voice for the first time and knows he has missed his target. Sarah mentions that she's hiding in Tech Noir, thus inadvertently giving the Terminator her location. The Terminator then quickly searches Sarah's house and recovers her address book, thus giving her other possible locations she might choose to hide, as well as her ID, which lets him know what she looks like. At the club, the Terminator is attacked by Reese and it realizes that this must be the Sarah Connor it is looking for.",
            "It does sound like a perfect opportunity: Kyle and Sarah are held at gunpoint by the police, so the Terminator should have merely drawn a gun and killed them all. However, when the police officers check Terminator's car, the windshield is still there, so the Terminator was not thrown out through the front. Instead, one cop notices that the passenger door is open, implying that the Terminator escaped through there into an alley. In one of the next scenes, we see Terminator entering a room to perform some repairs on itself. It opens up its arm, because the mechanics inside are apparently jammed, and removes the eye because it probably obstructs its view. Its gun was probably also thrown out of the car during the crash. The Terminator continually analyzes its situation and mission parameters, and probably assessed after the crash that it could not properly handle Sarah, Kyle and an entire squad of police officers (many armed with shotguns which were capable of at least damaging it) with a defective arm, bad vision and no gun, so it chose to leave, make repairs first and then try again. When it attacks the police station it is fully functional, better armed, has the element of surprise and is facing the police mostly one on one and only armed with pistols. There are more scenes were the Terminator seems to make a careful assessment before choosing a course of action that has the best change of fulfilling its mission. When it has been run over by a truck later on, the Terminator could have simply walked towards the turned-over car with Sarah and Kyle inside, and killed her; however, knowing that its leg is damaged (it can merely limp) and Sarah may be able to outrun it, Terminator chooses to take no chances, confiscates a truck and tries to run them over.Another plausible explanation is that the Terminator is programmed not to reveal what it truly is, since this information could not only hinder its mission, but also disrupt future events as well. In any situation in which the Terminator's true identity is at risk, it takes measures to avoid being discovered; hence the reason why it left the scene when it could have simply killed Sarah. In the end, by the time it has lost its skin, it no longer matters, since its prime objective, at this point, is to kill Sarah at any cost. Also, there is no one else around during the final chase. You'll also note that without definitive proof, the police don't even believe Kyle's story. They tell Sarah that this so-called \"terminator\" is someone who is likely wearing some kind of body armor as well as being on drugs in order to offer, what they believe to be, a plausible explanation.",
            "Lt. Traxler was shot in the gut by the Terminator. He is seen laying in the doorway holding his gut when Vukovich checks on him, he is still alive. Gut shots are famous for being very painful and causing a slower death. So chances are a surviving officer was able to call for medical attention so it's likely that he lived. After checking on Traxler, Vukovich stands in the doorway and opens fire on the Terminator, who turns and fires back. When the Terminator fires his AR-18, we hear Vukovich grunt, implying he was hit. It's unknown whether the shot killed him or not. The Terminator also fires one shot from his SPAS-12 at Vukovich but it's unknown whether it hit him. In a deleted scene when Reese and Sarah are running through the station trying to avoid the Terminator, Traxler stops them and finally believes them about the Terminator and hands them a gun to protect Sarah. After they thank him and run off, Traxler collapses against the wall. One idea for Terminator 2 was for Lance Henriksen to reprise his role as Detective Vukovich but now in a wheelchair, having suffered spinal injuries after being shot in the first film but this never came to fruition.\nIt has been argued that they both must have died otherwise the authorities would know about the Terminators, but this is not necessarily the case. We know that Dr Silverman and many of the other police officers in the building survived (in Terminator 2 it is mentioned that 17 were killed and 13 wounded) but it would seem far more likely that the authorities would believe in a lone gunman wearing body armour rather than Sarah's wild story of time travel and killer cyborgs.\nUltimately the fate of both characters is left unclear, either or both may have died or lived.",
            "The Terminator's eye was badly damaged during the car chase with Reese and Sarah. The living tissue covering the Terminator's body heals in a manner similar to regular human tissue. The same would also be true for injures that are sustained to a Terminator's exterior flesh that cannot be easily heal or heal at all. In this case, the T-800's eye was damaged beyond repair and, more than likely, was clouding his vision through his true cyborg eye, so he removed it to regain his perfect cybernetic vision.",
            "Sure that the Terminator has been destroyed in the fiery truck crash, Sarah and Kyle hug each other. Behind them, the android emerges from the debris, its flesh completely burned off. It follows them into a factory where Kyle turns on the automated machines in order to make tracking them more difficult. Still, the Terminator succeeds in cornering them on some scaffolding, and Kyle is forced to place a bomb in the chassis of the android. The bomb explodes, scattering pieces of the android but severely wounding Sarah in the leg and killing Kyle. While attempting to crawl away, Sarah is attacked by the top half of the Terminator's skeleton. She succeeds in luring it into a compactor and, even while it still tries to break her neck, she crushes it until its red eye fades. In the following scene, she is taken in an ambulance to the hospital while Kyle is removed in a body bag. In the final scenes, some months later, a pregnant Sarah is driving through the southwestern desert and stops at a gas station. While her tank is being filled, she continues to dictate into a cassette she is making for her son. She questions whether she should tell him about Kyle being his father and wonders whether that will affect his decision to send Kyle back in time to save Sarah. A young boy snaps her picture and asks for $5.00. She gives him $4.00 and keeps the photo (it's the same photo that John will give Kyle in the future). The boy looks off into the distance and says that a storm is coming. Sarah replies, \"I know,\" and drives off.",
            "Not in the context of this movie. In the film we see that Kyle Reese fell in love with Sarah from looking at a picture of her which had survived Judgment Day. He describes how he was attracted to the melancholy look she had about her. In the final scene of the film we see the picture being taken and that the melancholy look is caused by the fact that Sarah is thinking of Reese, her dead love. Within the context of the first film, this should probably not be considered a paradox. What we see in The Terminator is that history is unchanging. The Terminator came back to stop John Connor from ever being born, but in doing so, it actually caused him to be born. In the first movie, time cannot be changed and there is no version of history where Sarah was not attacked by the Terminator in 1984. The second film doubles down on the circular nature of the timeline by making clear that Cyberdyne creates Skynet using technology which they reverse-engineered from parts of the Terminator which Sarah and Kyle fought. Thus, not only John Connor, but also Skynet itself are the result of the attempt by Skynet to eliminate John. The second movie, however differs from the first in arguing that time can be changed. The photograph, which is created by information from the future and then contributes to its own creation, is inspired by the time travel romance film Somewhere in Time (1980), starring Christopher Reeve (a difference of only one letter from \"Reese\") and Jane Seymour. That film, which involves Reeve traveling back in time and meeting Seymour, has a pocket watch which exists in an eternal \"loop\". It is never actually created but is instead passed from Reeve to Seymour and back again."

            "The crew is very small to begin with; 11 Marines plus Ripley, Burke and Bishop, 14 in total. It's possibly an economical move by the military so they don't have to deal with logistics (food, water, supplies) of a large crew. With the crew streamlined, the company or the military don't have to provide a lot of provisions and cryosleep pods for more people.Additionally, the ship appears to be fully automated and controllable in the absence of the crew. When they become stranded after the 1st dropship is destroyed, Ripley floats the idea of contacting the Sulaco in orbit from the planet's surface and having it prep the other dropship and launch it. Therefore, it wouldn't be necessary to leave anyone aboard the ship.However, as we see, this creates a few problems: automating the Sulaco doesn't account for equipment failure or destruction, like the dropship and the APC, so the crew's situation becomes very tricky. They could have easily contacted the Sulaco from the APC but it was destroyed in the dropship disaster. Add to that the fact that Bishop discovers the processing station is going to explode in only a few hours and their situation becomes more dire.They then use Ripley's idea of contacting the Sulaco remotely, which proves to be very difficult and dangerous because the colony's transmitting dish can't be operated from their communications center. So they send Bishop to do it, logical since Bishop says he's the only crewmember who can bring the ship down on remote.In the end, it would indeed have been practical to have a member stay behind. But the dropship was waiting away from the facility. Waiting to be called to pick them up. Should the dropship fail, they could remotely call another from the APC. The sheer rotten luck of having the dropship crash on to the APC, thus destroying their two main ways to get back to the Sulaco had a very slim chance of happening.",
            "One could look at this as a moment of personal revenge for Ripley. She knew the facility was about to explode and kill the Queen, but she wanted some Payback on the species for killing so many innocent people, including her friends and crew, and robbing her of her life with her daughter.\nAlso, this was Ripley's true moment to face her fears, having been haunted by dreams of the Alien.Also, Ripley noticed an egg opening. So she thought it best to destroy them before they hatched and a swath of facehuggers attacked her and Newt.",
            "Bishop, the android character in the film \"Aliens,\" is designed to have human-like characteristics, including the ability to experience pain. This is likely included as a safety feature, so that the android can respond appropriately to dangerous situations. Additionally, it can also be used as a tool for the character development, as Bishop's ability to feel pain makes him more relatable to the human characters and audience, and adds to the emotional impact of the scene in which the Queen impales him with her tail.",
            "Likely not. Burke had no way of knowing if Ripley's account was actually true. Burke was on Ripley's side until she started talking about nuking the facility and wiping out the alien species, which Burke would likely be blamed for, as he was the company representative on the mission.Once Ripley confronted him, revealing she found out he was responsible for the outbreak at the colony, he decided his best course of action was to get Ripley and Newt impregnated and set up the surviving marines to be killed. That would ensure covering up his role in the outbreak and bringing the specimens to Weyland-Yutani. Making him a hero to his superiors.",
            "It wasn't so much a crawlspace as it was a space between the ducts and the ceiling. And they missed it because it wasn't in any of the blueprints they looked at. Not even the aliens knew about this entrance originally. In the Special Edition, the group set up two sets of automatic sentry guns at the two main junctions leading to operations. The aliens attack both positions at different times, but the sentry guns hold them at bay. Ripley then says that they'll likely try looking for other ways in. That's when the aliens find their way in through the ceiling.",
            "Because he knew he wouldn't miss. But he also put his own hand over Hudson's to protect Hudson should he miss.",
            "Likely because she used an emergency override to open the hatch while the inner hatch was open. This may have rendered the ladder controls inoperable. So she needed to climb up to use the main dock controls to close the inner hatch.",
            "The film's dialogue gives some context as to answer this. Hicks mentions that once they are overdue for rescue (presumably because they lose contact with the authorities on Earth or Gateway Station like the colonists did, and given the destruction of the APC's transmitter) any rescue can be expected 17 days later.This suggests total time in hypersleep to reach LV426 from Earth is shortly more than a fortnight. This time assumes there's also a day or so to prep any mission, and bring together the needed rescue team members for space transport.Obviously not very long then in real terms, so we wouldn't expect any noticeable aging for Newt, in this time.One may additionally ask: why bother to put people in hyper sleep at all then, for only a two week stretch? However, it may be (a) more cost effective and/or (b) personnel are somehow protected from effects of high space flight speeds by doing so and (c) the trip without hyper sleep would mean travelling much slower, and take then a lot longer to get there. This would also save on food/water supplies as well as oxygen levels.Travelling at lower speeds in space appears relatively safe, from what we see of the Nostromo, Narcissus and Sulaco. It appears that 57 years after the time of the Nostromo though, the journey to LV426 from Earth can now be done considerably faster. However, it's possible that faster speeds could expose human tissue/wellbeing to damage somehow, without certain protections.Routine hypersleep use then could mean taking off months or even years to reach a destination like LV426 safely and speedily, if it does provide protection from any such exposure.",
            "Because Vasquez was extremely emotional at the slaughter of her fellow Marines. Including her best friend, Drake. Gorman was in charge of the mission and was extremely ineffectual in his role. Vasquez likely blamed him for the deaths of the team. While she wasn't likely going to actually kill him, despite saying she was going to, she was about to strike the unconscious Gorman until Hicks stopped her.",
            "Ripley leaves Jonesy on the space station. Likely in the care of someone else. Given that Ripley never gets the opportunity to return to the space station, it's likely that Jones was adopted by someone.",
            "This is not made completely clear in any of the films, though there are plausible explanations. One reason may be that the Company's first secret attempts to obtain the Alien were only known by a few of its executives (the ones who re-routed the Nostromo to LV-426's vicinity) and that they were no longer in a position to send another team to LV-426, after the events of the first film. Another reason could be that they simply had no opportunity. With the Nostromo declared missing, there were undoubtedly large inquiries done - which would only have drawn attention to their unethical acquisition of the Alien. In that case, the Company officials involved probably had little other choice than to bury the project.With the 2014 Alien: Isolation video game now also considered official universe canon, it was established some within the Company would indeed know about the Alien specimen, 15 years later (it is unclear if this was the same officials or not from earlier). However, it was not until its flight recorder was found, 15 years after the Nostromo's disappearance, that the location of the derelict on LV-426 was established. Note also this recorder was NOT found and tracked by the Company itself either, but by independent contractors: who by chance happened upon the adrift flight recorder, and then tracked the Derelict's coordinates from it, and followed.Given the subsequent destruction of the Sevastopol station and contractor's ship in the game; the loss of the data on the recorder being held on Sevastopol; the shutting off of the locator beacon on LV-426 by the captain for the contractors; and all communications being blocked from the station for most of the time of the game, the Company officials likely then just did not know afterwards the location on LV-426. Not until the discovery of the Narcissus and Ripley, decades later, would that data come to light. They only knew in the meantime it was somewhere on the planetoid.Knowing only the Derelict was somewhere on LV-426 was probably of limited use, without specific location. And given alongside the concurrent loss of a very expensive Sevastopol station, related to Alien activity, while in Company ownership: there likely would have been every motivation from Company higher ups who knew of the Alien's involvement, to again try and conceal its existence from public knowledge. They would need to cover up locating the Alien had led to the further loss of the lives eventually of all the contractors involved, the entire personnel of the Sevastopol, and two Company employees. Add that then to the original loss of most of the Nostromo's crew originally and law enforcement investigation and severe criminal penalties would undoubtedly be severe if discovered. Execs were probably busy in (a) concocting a false story behind the Sevastopol's loss, and (b) trying to quietly dispose of all Alien information logs alongside. Although Ripley's daughter Amanda is the sole survivor of the Sevastopol incident, it is not clear (in canon) what happens yet to her immediately afterwards, but information at least from her about the Alien we do know is not made public.A further 15 years later, about thirty years after the events of the first film, the Company would begin terraforming the LV-426 planet. A colony is set up there. However, neither the colonists nor any Company employees seem to know anything about the Derelict Ship, until Ripley arrives back at Earth 20 years later. The beacon had also been deactivated 15 years earlier, at the time of the Sevastopol incident. Burke now instructs the colonists to investigate the Derelict Ship. This supports the notion that the Company's information about the Alien and their plans to obtain it had indeed been deliberately buried in the interim, in the 57 years in total it took Ripley to return to Earth.Perhaps no one involved in earlier attempts was in power anymore by this time (otherwise they may have tried to send someone out earlier). In the colony's information log, Ripley later reads that Burke sent the colonists to the Derelict Ship, directly after hearing about it from her testimony.Burke says he did this for three reasons: (1) he wasn't certain that there even was a Derelict Ship on the planet, (2) making it an official investigation rather than a coincidental finding would make it a security situation, resulting in the loss of any rights to anything found on the planet, and (3) he hoped to obtain an Alien specimen and make millions by selling it for bio-weapons research. While on Earth, Burke may have had access to classified Company documents that detailed their earlier attempts to obtain the Alien, and sacrificed entire crews and property to get it. He then simply chose to follow up on that plan, or he just heard Ripley's story about the Alien and thought it was an interesting species for the bioweapon research program: not knowing the Company had at least twice tried to obtain one decades before.",
            "Prior to his encounter with the Aliens, Hudson is only concerned that this is going to be another \"bug hunt\". During the first encounter with the Aliens, his point of view changes drastically. He probably did not expect the Aliens to put up much of a fight or to be so unstoppable against all their superior military weaponry. He also loses his composure after seeing many of his squad claimed by the Aliens. He is one of only three marines to survive the encounter. As they set up a barricade, Hudson begins to slowly sink into a state of paranoia, even questioning Ripley's judgment and her ideas of survival. Eventually, Ripley calms him down stating, \"We really need you and I'm sick of your bullshit.\"-she acts like an officer, a position she was promised by Burke if she went with the Marines on their mission. Hudson starts to gain control of his fears, partly because Ripley is acting like an officer, therefore he'll fall in line, and because he suddenly remembers what his job entails-acting like a soldier. When the Aliens overrun Operations, Hudson fights without fear, constantly taunting the Aliens and gunning them down at will. Secondly, from a film making perspective, Hudson represents \"the audience\". By portraying him as panicking and stricken with fear, it represents what normal people would do if they were in a similar situation. After all, if none of the characters were shown to be afraid of the aliens, they wouldn't seem nearly as menacing. It also allows the audience to develop a sense of compassion and empathy for the on screen characters-right before the aliens mount their final attack, even Hicks seems afraid. The role of the audience was portrayed by the Lambert character in the first film.",
            "When Ripley learned that Burke intended to secretly bring the Facehuggers back to Earth for bioweapon research, she threatened to alert the Earth authorities that he was smuggling in dangerous organisms. She further vowed to report him for his role in the slaughter of the colonists as he sent them to the derelict ship without warning them of what was inside. However, Burke's intention wasn't to kill Ripley but to get her and Newt impregnated with the alien embryos, then freeze their bodies in order to get them through quarantine. In the first film, after Kane was impregnated, he was unconscious for a long period of time after the facehugger had fallen off. Ripley & Newt would experience the same side-effect. Burke figured that no one would know what they were carrying inside, and they were simply the only two at the time who were isolated enough for the impregnation to succeed.",
            "The Facehuggers were being kept in stasis tubes in the Med Lab. The most probable explanation is that Burke returned to the Med Lab after bringing Lt Gorman to Operations. He then placed the tubes on slow drain just before he left the Lab again. When the fluid in the stasis tubes had drained sufficiently, the Facehuggers revived enough to escape from the tubes themselves. It's possible that, in addition to the stasis fluid neutralizing the effects of the acid, they might have had some sort of analgesic that also numbed them and reduced their considerable strength. Once the tubes had drained and the analgesic had worn off, they could pop the covers of the tubes and escape. The draining of the fluid from the tubes could also have involved loosening the covers slightly which might give the creatures an advantage in escaping.",
            "In the previous movie, the one Alien was smart enough to single out mostly individual victims instead of a group (Brett, Dallas), and to stow away on the shuttle when the Nostromo was set to self-destruct. This implies a reasonable capacity for thinking. However, it did menace Lambert, seemingly not realizing or caring that Parker was armed with a flamethrower (to the Alien's luck, Parker couldn't use it without harming Lambert anyway). In the DVD commentary, James Cameron states that the Aliens in Aliens had been alive for a few weeks at least and, thus, had plenty of time to adapt and learn. Some viewers say that the Aliens have more than enough capacity to reason that humans are dependent on light and electrical energy. It cannot be clearly deduced how intelligent Aliens are. They eventually learn to stay away from the sentry guns (in the Special Edition), but it takes them quite a number of sacrifices before they find out. This suggests that they learn through a process of trial-and-error. Generally speaking, the quicker an organism learns, the more intelligence it possesses. Just like small children, they need to experience it first before they can learn anything about it. It is very much possible that they damaged a conduit by accident earlier in life, noticed how it caused the power to go out, and used that knowledge to intentionally cut the power later. Others postulate that the introduction of a Queen indicates that the Aliens are a hive species, reducing the Aliens to mere drones with no more intelligence than a very evolved insect. By this reasoning, the Aliens did not intentionally cut the power, but accidentally damaged some electrical conduits, probably while they were finding ways into the complex through the ceiling. Staying with the insectoid/hive mind idea, along with the insinuated intelligence of the Queen, it is possible that the Queen learned of human's dependency on power and lighting through observation, and then ordered the drones/warriors to cut the power (even though they may or may not have understood why they did it).",
            "The Queen seems to display a fair ability to reason. She recognises the threat that Ripley's flamethrower poses (after some demonstration) and then calls off her warrior Aliens. She is also able to figure out how an elevator works; notice that Ripley needs to press the switch in order to go up; the Queen must have done the same to reach the platform. It is unclear whether she knew this procedure ahead of time or whether she was imitating Ripley's actions (although it is possible that the elevator goes back up automatically, as it did when Ripley first came down into the sub levels and the elevator closed and departed after she disembarked). She also appears to know how to safely hitchhike on a dropship (or was it lucky chance that she ended up safe in the landing strut bay?). This opens the possibility that it is just the Queen that displays intelligence, and the warrior Aliens simply obey her.",
            "When Ripley and Hicks are escaping, they enter an elevator, as the door closes an alien forces its way through and so Hicks shoots it. The result has the acid splashing all over Hicks' armor and he likely got small spatters on his arms and face. Aboard the dropship, Hicks has bandages all over his upper torso and around his head as well. In subsequent comic book adaptations (which are an alternate storyline from where Alien 3 went) show Hicks with a scar on the left side of his face. As he was leaving the elevator with Ripley he clearly had black scorch marks on the left side of his face which were likely a result of his getting some arterial spray.",
            "Ripley helps Cpl Hicks out to the dropship where Bishop (Lance Henriksen) is waiting for them. With only 19 minutes left before the complex blows up, Ripley forces Bishop to fly to the atmosphere processor, so she can get back into the hive to get Newt, using her homing bracelet to track her. When Ripley locates the bracelet, however, she finds it on the floor and Newt is nowhere to be seen. Suddenly, Newt, who has been cocooned nearby, sees an Alien egg opening and a Facehugger about to leap out at her, so she screams. Ripley finds her, kills the Facehugger and releases Newt from the cocoon, and they start running back to the surface. Along the way, she takes a wrong turn, and they suddenly find themselves in a lair, facing the egg-laying Alien Queen. As she and Newt slowly back away, Aliens close in around them. The Queen \"orders\" the Aliens to back away when Ripley threatens to destroy her eggs. Ripley finally empties her flame-thrower and automatic rifle on the Queen, the Aliens and the eggs, and tosses in her arsenal of grenades, destroying the Queen's means of laying them. However, the Queen herself survives and chases after Ripley and Newt as they head back up through the complex to the platform, only to find that the dropship is no longer there. Just as a second elevator door opens and the Queen comes out, the dropship appears and picks them up. They head back to the Sulaco, and the complex blows up. As they're disembarking from the dropship onto the deck of the Sulaco, Bishop explains that the platform was becoming too unstable, forcing him to take to the air and to hover while waiting for them. Suddenly, Bishop is pierced through the chest by a large tail and then ripped in half. The Queen emerges from the landing gear of the dropship where she managed to stow away as the dropship was leaving the colony. Newt takes cover under the floor grates, while Ripley tries to divert the Queen by running into the cargo hold and closing the heavy steel door. The Queen then goes after Newt, but Ripley emerges from the hold in one of the mechanical cargo power-loaders that makes her more of a match in size and strength for the Queen. The two \"mothers\" fight each other, with Ripley eventually able to trap the Queen in an airlock and blow her into space. In the final scene, Bishop and Hicks have been placed in hypersleep, and Newt and Ripley do likewise for the return trip to Earth.",

He gives a long tortured scream as seen from the point of view from his camera.(5) Sgt Apone (Al Matthews): While he is ordering the ceasefire to prevent rupture of the cooling system, Apone is taken by an Alien.

As Hudson noted only Apone and Dietrich showed life signs.(7) Pvt Spunkmeyer (Daniel Kash): Killed by an Alien offscreen after he finds saliva when boarding the dropship (or killed in the crash, if the Alien had not killed him by then).(8) Cpl Ferro (Colette Hiller): When the door opens behind her, she assumes it is Spunkmeyer. When she turns around, it is an Alien, which kills her and causes the dropship to crash.(9) Pvt Hudson (Bill Paxton): After an intense firefight, Hudson is pulled through the floor and presumably taken to be cocooned, though he would have been killed when the atmosphere processor erupted.(10) Burke (Paul Reiser): He tries to escape from the others and believes he has done so. A door opens behind him, revealing an Alien, which presumably killed him. (In the comic book \"Newt's Tale,\" as well as in a deleted scene not included in the Director's Cut, Ripley and Newt later encountered Burke in a cocoon. Ripley gives him a grenade to end his own life, but he was unable to bring himself to do it.) If he was cocooned, he would have died when the atmosphere processor detonated.(11) Pvt Vasquez (Jenette Goldstein) and Lt Gorman (William Hope): After Vasquez is injured by acid, Gorman runs back for her and starts to drag her out. Surrounded by aliens, Gorman detonates a grenade, killing both of them and taking several Aliens with them."

Their swords eventually destroy the scaffolding, and Brenda finds herself hanging precariously from her wrists over the street far below. As Connor and Kruger continue their swordplay, Brenda eventually works herself free and climbs down onto the roof.

        "answers": [
            "Taylor is using \"fathers\" as an allegory to describe the darkness and light we all posses. In the film Barnes clearly represents the darkness and evil while Elias is the light and goodness. When Taylor is evacuated from the battle field and discussing his \"fathers\" he says it's his duty to grow and become a better person. Therefore he's chosen the path of Elias aka good and rejected evil.",
            "No, it's anti-war. It's about how war is an immoral and evil thing and you must become evil and immoral to survive it.Also anyone who thinks that the movie is \"un-American\" should also note that the film depicts the NVA as just as ruthless and savage.",
            "For two reasons:1) He didn't think Chris had it in him to kill his own comrade in cold blood, and it was his way of taunting him2) If it turned out that Chris did actually have it in him to kill Barnes then Chris will have become just as ruthless and evil of a person as Barnes was. Barnes would have brought Chris down to his level of evil and would have officially corrupted his soul which means he still would have won.",
            "A soldier causing a self-inflicted wound to get off the front line has certainly happened. Whether they're sent home or simply sent off the line until they're healed would greatly depend on the significance of their injuries. If they were permanently damaged in some way; such as losing a limb, severe nerve damage, etc., then they would be sent home. If their wounds were minor and would fully heal in a few weeks -- like the minor wound Chris receives in the first battle of the film -- they'd be sent to a hospital and once they had healed, were sent back to the front line. It's possible Francis' tour was close to being over. So he stabbed himself in order to be taken off duty long enough to be sent home.",
            "As stated in the trivia, Charlie Sheen improvised this, as he felt Chris would be suicidal by the end of the movie, having murdered Barnes in cold blood and seen the horrors of what the men fighting on the same side as him would do to each other and innocent people during the conflict. Taylor picked up the grenade, but once one of the other soldiers made their way to him, he probably felt it was better to live and get shipped home to be with the ones he loved.",
            "The ammo box they were poking around in was obviously wired to an explosive device, a common method used by Viet Cong and NVA forces to kill the enemy. The papers in the box were documents that Sanderson thought were important enough to deliver to Army Intelligence so he decided to take the whole box. However, soldiers were strictly forbidden to touch any objects they found in the field that seemed out of place or looked important. Sanderson either ignored this rule or felt that because he'd been able to open the box that it wasn't booby-trapped (as often the explosives are set to detonate when opening the box). There's a similar scene in Full Metal Jacket (1987) where a toy rabbit is used as a booby trap, presumably to attract a child but it attracted the man it killed first.",
            "Rhah and O'Neill are the only prominent characters left, as neither got so much of a scratch in the final battle.

Therefore they would probably have to break in new recruits, until the WIA's were fit for duty again.",

            "Best explanation is that the evil force is weaker having just been reawakened but by the time we see it later it had grown stronger.",
            "All of this happened, but because no footage from the first movie could be shown due to rights issues, Evil Dead II's first 7 minutes serve as a simplified recap of the events of the first movie. Probably because of the movies limited runtime of 84 minutes, only the things that still play a role in the rest of the movie are shown.Since Linda's dead body gets reanimated to further torment Ash, she is featured in the prologue (and of course because it would be weird if Ash went to the cabin all on his own). Cheryl, Scotty and Shelly, however, died in the first movie and don't come back, which is probably why they were excluded; not introducing them also speeds things up considerably.Similarly, the Book of the Dead was burned by Ash in the first film. The book is prominently reintroduced in the prologue, but not its destruction; this may have been left out as the book doesn't reappear again in the rest of the film anyway: only the book's missing pages brought along by Annie do.This short recap leaves out several things, but the advantage is that Evil Dead II can be watched as a stand-alone sequel without knowledge of the original. The downside is that there are several visual and narrative inconsistencies when both films are watched back-to-back, which is why many (understandably) believed that Evil Dead II was supposed to be an elaborate remake of the original rather than a sequel.",
            "The most obvious explanation is that Ash's previous possession (which was cured by sunlight) gave him a greater degree of resistance when he's possessed again so the sight of the necklace affects him more and restores his humanity.Another explanation:The necklace is not magical, but it reminds possessed Ash of Linda and thus taps into his humanity. So it would not have affected Linda in any way, since it doesn't have any powers in and of itself."

Or, if it does actually short out, as opposed to simply shutting down, then some sort of auto-repair mechanism may come into play to restore the cloaking device back to a functional state.

            "At this point, the Predator more than likely sees Dutch as the most worthy opponent he had faced and it is even impressed by his stamina and prowess. This is supported by the fact that it examines Dutch closely by scanning his skull.\nIt then decides to abandon almost all of its weapons (except the wrist blades) and remove its mask, in order to engage in a classic duel to the death as a matter of honor and pride.",
            "He likely didn't. During this tense moment, his tone and body language conveyed a sense of urgency to know what she really saw. Anna (from Dutch's POV) would understand that Dutch was sick of the BS and needed an answer to what they had previously asked her twice. She decided it was useless to stop withholding information and give up what she knew, but everybody expected Spanish, not English. Dutch may have also simply assumed she knew more than she was letting on. English is one of the three most common languages on earth along with Spanish and Mandarin. As a second-language English is most commonly learned. So even if Anna didnt speak English, she'd likely be able to pick up enough of what he was asking to understand.Another possibility is that Dutch has a keen sense of observation, noticing details and inconsistences others might overlook or miss. Just as he was quick to suspect his friend Dillon of deception, he was even more distrustful of Anna as a liability that would give away their position. After the encounters with the Predator, Dutch silently observed that Anna was listening in to their conversations about the unseen threat and reacting visibly. After the events of the first night, he had no doubt she was fluent in English.",

Otherwise, the human body will gradually warm the mud to a detectable level.It should be noted that the Yautja's IR tech does not detect any heat signatures in the environment that would have been caused by the sun's radiation, during the daytime in the hottest months of the year. The Yautja would likely calibrate their biomask's IR to optimally detect the specific heat temperatures of their prey, within hot and humid environments. Apparently, this calibration ironically worked in Dutch's favor, making him appear just as blue to the Yautja as his surroundings. Whereas an 'uncalibrated' human made IR optic might have detected Dutch's open eyes and breath, if not his person.",
            "Dutch was wounded and exhausted. He was just sent tumbling off a cliff and into a waterfall. After being churned under the water he manages to resurface and swim ashore. Dutch then takes a moment to rest in the mud.",
            "They first hang the corpses upside down after disemboweling (or before) them and then flay them with the wrist-blades or a knife.",
            "After the Predator forcibly removes the spine with skull from Billy's corpse, the very shot shows that the gore covered skull with the lower jaw missing. If the lower jaw didn't come off when the spine with skull were pulled, the Predator removed it by hand.As far as the missing teeth. The Predator was rather rough with Billy's bloody skull, bringing it down pretty hard onto a rock. The bottoms of the upper teeth was the part of the skull making striking contact with the rock. It's possible the missing teeth fell out during the remainder of the skull trophy cleaning process. It's also possible that the teeth were lost when the predator was killing whoever the skull belonged to.",
            "The group were moving fairly slowly, given that Dutch had to carry a wounded Poncho. The Predator likely killed Billy within a minute or two of them leaving him. When Dillon and Mac were going after the Predator, we see that it is extremely agile and can run very fast as well. So it likely sprinted to the trees and caught up to them in no time at all.",
            "No one has answered this question yet.",
            "Although the Predator displays only three of his trophies onscreen, we witness the deaths of all six of Dutch's team members, leaving many wondering what happened to the remaining skulls. It's very likely the Predator collected trophies from all six victims, but we simply do not see this. The skull with the hole in it is said to be Poncho's, as he was shot (blasted) in the head. However, Poncho was shot in the left side of his head, while the hole is on the top of the skull, so this is either a goof or someone else. The others are unknown. One of them may have belonged to Billy, as we witness the Predator rip Billy's spine from his back and clean his skull, and the other was probably Dillon's as he put up the biggest fight besides Dutch and Billy. It has been speculated that one of the other skulls may have been Blain's since the Predator entered the squad's camp to retrieve his body.Some believe the skull with the exit hole was Mac's because initially it appears that Mac is shot in the head. Also he is the only member of the team besides Dutch to injure the Predator. But in the brief shot of him laying on his back when Dillon finds him, you can clearly see he has a big hole in his chest, yet his head is unmarked. This is likely another continuity error in the movie, where the crew may had filmed a portion of this scene already and changed the setup for the second part, creating a goof. Some say that the angle from which he was shot created an exit wound through the back of his neck, and this, combined with the camera angle on his death, gives the appearance that the blood bursts from his head. However, when freeze-framing Mac's death scene, the blood can definitely be seen coming from Mac's forehead, not his neck. After his body falls down, his leg can be seen twitching, which also seems more compatible with brain trauma (because a shot through the chest and neck would likely sever the spinal cord, so the legs would no longer be able to receive nerve impulses from the brain). Also, it is possible that the three trophies that are displayed belonged to Jim Hopper's men. As we only see, three of Hopper's men strung up and skinned. Therefore the Predator may have kept Dutch's team mates' body parts somewhere else.",
            "No. The log was a counterweight for a spike trap Dutch had set up. He had cut wooden stakes and tied them to a log over the top of a ditch, and set a trip wire under it. The wire was tied to the log. The idea was that when the Predator tripped the wire, he'd be hoisted up and slammed into the spikes. When Dutch tried to sucker him into such a trap, he almost fell for it but saw the spikes at the last second and went around. Unfortunately for him, he stopped and stood over Dutch directly under the log counterweight, so Dutch springs the trap himself, dropping the log on the Predator and disabling him.",
            "It appears that not all of them were. Three of them were skinned and hung upside down, but they were not made in to trophies. It's possible that the Predator does this to victims it finds unworthy to be trophies. As it witnessed Dutch's small team manage to take out an entire platoon of soldiers, it may have found each of them to be worthy of trophies. Dutch asks Billy what happened to the rest of Hopper's men. Billy replies, \"There's no sign, sir. They never left here. Hell, it's like they just disappeared.\" So it's possible the Predator took the rest as trophies. Perhaps they put up more of a fight than the other three. Something similar happens in Predator 2: when the Predator kills the Colombians, train car passengers and Jamaicans in the apartment, it only takes one trophy from the Colombians and none from the Jamaicans in the apartment. Yet it takes a trophy from Jerry and King Willy. It's unknown if the Predator took a trophy from Danny, as no mention is made of the state in which he was found, other than his heart was nearly cut in half and death was instantaneous. In the scene where King Willy meets the Predator, he draws a sword from the staff/cane he carries. Likewise, the Predator appears to extend its gauntlet blades in response. It's possible that a scene was supposed to follow where Willy and the Predator engaged in combat with their edged weapons and Willy would lose or the writers were just relying on the audience to figure out that part since Willy obviously doesn't survive. In the end, the Predator must have thought Willy to be a worthy opponent and walked off with his head, making a trophy out of his skull.",
            "The first person killed by the Predator's shoulder cannon (aka plasmacaster) was Blaine. He is shot from a far distance and hit in the back, which leaves an exit wound the size of a basketball in his chest. There is something of a continuity error at the moment he's hit; a splash of blood hits him in the neck and back of the head. One theory is that the Predator initially fired a different weapon that missed Blaine, and the Predator then switched to the shoulder cannon. In scenes where characters are supposed to be splashed with fluids like blood, a small gun of sorts (often nicknamed a \"guacamole gun\") is placed off camera and the fluid is shot onto the actor or stunt person. The production crew and director probably shot the blood onto Jesse Ventura thinking they'd shoot further enhancements to the scene showing a different action taking place.Next killed was Mac, he is shot at close range in the chest (continuity shows him shot in the head, but his body is shown to have his head intact and his chest with the wound) the wound in his chest is relatively small, we never see the exit wound. Third hit with the cannon is Dillon. The Predator is perched on a tree branch and fires at Dillon, hitting him in the arm, completely severing it. Finally, Poncho is shot in the left side of the forehead and there seems to be very minimal damage, though he is killed, there is no exit wound, and there's minimal blood shown. It's possible that the predator, being so close to Pancho and wanting his skull for a trophy, reduced the power of the cannon so as to cause less damage.Then Dutch is hit in the shoulder, if one watches the scene in slow motion, one can see that the blast hits the M16 assault rifle which Dutch is carrying, and the rifle can clearly been seen being blasted in to two separate pieces. There is a large burst of blood from his arm, he is knocked backwards, yet we see he has a minor three-inch cut on his arm. So it's possible he was hit in the shoulder by shrapnel. Some theories are as follows. (1) The Predator's weapon has different charged bursts. The longer it charges, the more powerful the damage. Which is supported in many of the video games. (2) The energy emitted from the cannon gathers more energy as it travels. The farther the distance it has to travel the more powerful it becomes. Which is supported by the larger wounds being suffered when fired from a farther distance. (3) Note, however, that the concept of what exactly constitutes the Predator creature was changed part-way through production. The original creature was shorter and more of a cross between an insect and a lizard that carried a spear gun-like weapon that can be seen hitting Blaine in the shoulder right before he turns and is shot in the back. Much of the film was shot with the original creature in mind, so this could explain the inconsistencies in the wounds.",
            "Dutch picks up a rock with the intention of finishing off the Predator, but it's obvious that the alien is already dying. He also reflects on the fact that the Predator is a living creature (which is now clearly in much pain) and ponders whether it's right to kill the creature out of vengeance. \"What the hell are you?\", Dutch asks rhetorically, and the Predator (not necessarily understanding the English language) mimics right back the rhythm of the question: \"What the hell are you?\" The Predator then starts to laugh (in a rhythm similar to Billy's) and to press some buttons on its wristband. Dutch realizes that the Predator has started a countdown to its own suicide and rushes to get as far away from there as quickly as possible. Suddenly the whole area explodes in a mushroom cloud, attracting the attention of the rescue helicopter (with Anna aboard). In the final scenes, the copter picks up Dutch and carries him out of the jungle."

Montoya fights the man with six fingers and kills him. Westley offers Montoya the chance to be the new Dread Pirate Roberts. The four ride off into the horizon.

            "William Goldman wrote both the book and the screenplay for the film. The major changes from the book (therefore) are condensations for length purposes. The book contains more background on the characters, particularly histories of Inigo Montoya and Fezzik before they join Vizzini. It also contains a much lengthier segment when Fezzik and Inigo break into Count Rugen's torture chamber. In addition, it contains a sequence where Miracle Max (Billy Crystal) makes Fezzik and Inigo go on a series of quests to obtain the ingredients for the resurrection pill. The framing device of the Grandfather reading the story to his Grandson is also less prominent in the book. The book, which claims to be Goldman's edited version of the S. Morgenstern original, includes a significant amount of commentary, similar to a DVD commentary track, from Goldman. This commentary details, among other things, Goldman's relationship with the book, which he claims was read to him as a child and which he read to his own fictitious son. One, somewhat significant change in Inigo's motivation is that in the film Inigo's father refuses to sell the Six Fingered Man the sword because the Six Fingered Man offers too low a sum. In the book he refuses to sell because the Six Fingered Man insults the quality of the sword. Buttercup in the book agrees to be Humperdinck's bride because it's better to be rich and alive than penniless and dead. She returns to Humperdinck after the Fire Swamp because she would rather live than die. (\"I can live without love\" are her exact words.) In the movie she is a much more sympathetic and intelligent character."

Take for instance Mike, the cop that Malone confronts late in the film to get information about Capone's bookkeeper: Mike had long since been bought off not only to look the other way but also to provide info to Capone's organization about potential raids on their storage facilities or drinking establishments.Malone didn't want that type of life on the force and because he was unwilling to accept bribes he was essentially ostracized by his fellow officers and his superiors as untrustworthy. Therefore he was never promoted to any higher ranks. It made him the perfect advisor and soldier that Ness was looking for: an incorruptible officer with years of experience and, even more importantly, knowledge of how alcohol smuggling operated in the city.It's also entirely possible Malone simply wasn't interested in promotions. He preferred being out on the street.",

Capone then had each of them beaten with bats and then executed, though Capone himself didn't take part in the beatings.As for the movie, the man he killed was the one in charge of the liquor warehouse at the post office that the Untouchables had raided in the previous scene. One possibility is that the guy had been arrested at the warehouse then released on bail and so Capone killed him to avoid any loose ends. Another theory is that the guy may have set up the operation without Capone's knowledge. Therefore, Capone killed him because he went into business for himself and put the entire organization at risk. This theory is supported by Capone's speech about teamwork and how the team loses if someone goes into it for themselves.Killing the guy like he did, in front of the others, also sent a clear message - stay in line or you're next."

In the same scene, Susan is playing with a doll sitting on her desk that has test recording sayings and voices from one of her co-workers.In the beginning of the scene where Susan is going into Paul's office to tell him about a dive in sales of a particular toy, there are some children running down the hall to the toy test room. Also, at the end of this scene, we see Paul trying to convince Susan she's responsible for a bad idea/business decision that belongs to him.There's a scene where Josh is calling his mother from the payphone in the hall of the flophouse in which he lives. The scene prior to this, he is in his room with Billy and insinuates he has a stomachache from all the eating they did. In the call to his mother, he tells her he's conducting a survey directed towards mothers to find out what they do to help their kids with a stomachache. She recommends Pepto Bismal every four hours.When in FAO Schwartz, there are some added lines and small scenes throughout Josh's time in there.There is an added bit at the beginning of the scene where Susan and Paul are having breakfast in on of their apartments while still in their robes, discussing Josh's appearance from nowhere. It ends with Susan putting down the carton of milk with Josh's picture on the back of it as a 12-year-old.After renting his apartment, there is an added piece before they try to drop the water balloon on the delivery person where it shows the delivery person is there to deliver Josh's furniture rental.There's a whole scene showing Josh and Billy renting a tuxedo for Josh, to wear to the company party in the following scene.For the company party scene, there' s a bit added to the beginning showing Paul being Paul, a jerk. There are also small lines added here and there, not shown in the shorter version of the movie, generally of Paul getting drunker and drunker as the night wears on, and being more of a jerk.When Susan and Josh are in his apartment for the first time, there is some additional scene showing them playing what looks like Risk, just before the movie shows them going to bed in the bunkbed.There's an added scene where Josh is working really late and sees the boss in his office. He goes to talk to him and the boss starts telling him about how toys used to be simple. This ends up being a bit of an epiphany for Josh.When Josh and Susan go on their first date to the amusement park, there are some small additional lines/scenes here and there.The next day, after the first date/night together, there's a small added bit where Susan brings her secretary a late wedding present.There's an added bit where Billy tries to call Josh at his apartment but no one answers, because it's empty, and Billy's parents are yelling at him to get off the phone.There's an added bit where Paul is trying to learn how to do tricks with a yo-yo, perhaps in a bid to try to be more \"youthful\" like Josh.There's a short scene showing Josh walking down the street when he stops to buy a Sports Illustrated. Nearby are some kids that are around 12 or 13 who are reading and sharing comic books. This leads into the next scene...There's an added scene or two where Susan and Josh are working together and Josh shares with her an electronic toy that seems a bit like Simon, but more so. She meets their boss who kind of lets her know he knows about she and Josh and is happy for them. This segues into another unseen scene where Billy tries to call Josh and gets no answer, and you can hear his parents arguing in the background.After Josh tells Susan he's really a kid, there's a scene where she wakes up and comes out of her bedroom. Josh's clothes are scattered all over the room and she starts picking them up. She finds his wallet and looks inside it. She finds the Zoltar card that says, \"Your wish is granted.\" Then, the movie shows them walking to work and her wanting to buy some gum from a street vendor. He picks up Bubbilicious for her and she gives a look of finally starting to believe him.Writer's note: There were other times in the movie that might have been part of the extended movie, but it'd been long enough since I've watched the movie I wasn't sure.

            "It is never explicitly mentioned by any of the terrorists how they plan to get away with the money while the area is full of policemen and FBI agents. Hans only says at one point: \"when you steal 600 million, they will find you, unless they think you're already dead.\" Later, one of his demands is for helicopters, suggesting that he wants to fly out of the building to a safe destination. However, he then confides to his henchmen that he intends to blow up the roof, together with the helicopters and hostages, in an attempt to confuse the authorities into thinking that everybody died in the explosion. At the end, we see Theo, Hans' computer hacker, driving an ambulance out of the terrorists' truck while wearing a paramedic's uniform. So it seems that the terrorists were planning to fake their own deaths by killing everyone, hoping that they could escape with an ambulance while posing as paramedics in the ensuing chaos. They would have escaped to a safe place long before the authorities discovered that the terrorists weren't among the dead bodies.",
            "The \"real\" reason, according to screenwriter Steven E. De Souza, is that the terrorists were supposed to be shown wearing and synchronizing the same type of watch in the beginning of the movie. After killing a couple of terrorists, John McClane started to notice the watches, so when Hans handed John a cigarette, John saw the watch on Hans' wrist, which tipped him off. However, due to some script changes during the shooting of the movie, the scene of the terrorists synchronizing their watches was dropped, leaving this clue unaddressed to the viewer. That, of course, does not rule out that John still identified Hans as one of the terrorists by his watch. Another logical explanation is that John simply recognized Gruber's voice. John was hiding on the roof of the elevator in the beginning, where he could hear Gruber's distinct voice quite well, and later he had several conversations with him over the radio. And even if John did not recognize the voice, he may have just been overly careful, since giving a gun to a stranger in this sort of situation is after all very risky. Gruber's pseudonym of Bill Clay appearing on the staff board is a reason to trust him, although there are a few subtle reasons to raise suspicion. Even if Gruber was actually an escaped hostage, John may have expected him to hide somewhere, instead of wandering around. John may have been observing for a moment as Hans was checking on the explosives, which is certainly suspicious behavior, before approaching him. John probably knew from the beginning that Hans was one of the hostage takers but decided to humor him to see how Hans would try to trick him. The gun may have been a bluff on John's part to confirm his suspicions of \"Bill Clay\". John may have been certain or at least highly suspicious of him, so giving him a gun and turning his back would be a sure-fire way to confirm whether he was actually dealing with \"Bill\" or \"Hans\".",

Franco gets shot in the knees as he runs towards McClane and lands head-first through a glass window, appearing to impale himself in the throat. Heinrich tries to get the drop on McClane and is shot in the chest.James and Alexander are blown up by McClane as they operate the missile launcher.Hans is shot in the shoulder by McClane then dropped to his death from the 30th floor.Karl is shot 5 times in the chest and torso by Powell.",

            "When the helicopters arrive, Gruber ushers all of the hostages up to the roof, which the terrorists have rigged with explosives. Taking Holly with him, Gruber then goes down to the vault to get the bonds. McClane climbs up to the roof and warns the hostages that they're going to be killed if they stay there, shooting his gun into the air to scare them, so everyone starts going downstairs. Unfortunately, the FBI helicopter mistakes McClane for one of the terrorists and starts shooting at him. Suddenly the roof explodes in flames, taking out the helicopter as well. McClane gets off the roof by tying himself to a firehose and jumping off the building. He then breaks the glass in a window and swings himself inside. He meets up with Gruber who is holding a gun to Holly's head. Gruber orders McClane to put down his gun, which he does, but when Gruber thinks that he's in control of the situation, McClane whips out a gun that he had taped to his back, shoots one of the remaining terrorists and wounding Gruber. Gruber falls backwards and out of a window, almost taking Holly with him. McClane releases Holly's wristwatch (to which Gruber was clinging), and Gruber falls to his death. Meanwhile, Argyle (De'voreaux White) crashes his limo into Theo's van (it's disguised as an ambulance), preventing him from getting away with the bonds. McClane and Holly leave the building together, and McClane and Officer Powell (Reginald VelJohnson) meet face-to-face for the first time. Karl comes out of the building armed with a gun. When he takes aim at McClane, Powell shoots Karl. Thornburg (William Atherton) attempts to interview McClane, but Holly punches him in the nose. Argyle comes crashing through the garage door in his limo and drives McClane and Holly away.",
            "Going to Holly's house to interview the children on TV was an invasion of her family's privacy and would reveal to the terrorists that Holly had children and possibly where they were located. This would then give the terrorists the opportunity to find them and kill or kidnap them -- at least, that's the reason she gives in the second movie. Also, Dick threatened Holly's babysitter (or nanny) with contacting the INS (Immigration & Naturalization Service) to gain entry to the house as well -- VERY unethical for a news reporter. On the other hand, Dick's actions caused Gruber to take Holly hostage and made the situation more difficult and dangerous for John by giving Hans that much leverage. The daughter also answers Dick's question,\"is there something you would like to say to them (parents) if they're watching?\" This tells Gruber that Holly's husband is also there at the tower and that he is likely John McClane, which is why he turns over the picture to verify it. Thus, Dick also endangers Holly and John, giving Gruber the leverage he needs to take care of McClane."

He pictures his life as it would have played out had he not died on the cross; namely, it depicts his fathering children first with Mary Magdalene and then Mary of Bethany.

        ],
        "answers": [
            "Lt Coffey (Michael Biehn) was suffering from High-Pressure Nervous Syndrome (HPNS), which causes hand tremors and also causes a state of paranoia. As Lindsey says early on, \"One in four people can't handle it. They just go buggo.\" Coffey insists that he and the rest of his SEAL team will be fine and that they all \"checked out\", i.e., they had been tested for the condition. However, Coffey turned out to be that one in four who did suffer from the condition. Also, Coffey, despite being a SEAL and having gone through some of the toughest military training there is, might not have had the opportunity to dive to the depth required for this mission.Also, consider the pressure Coffey suddenly found himself dealing with: after being ordered by his superior to salvage a nuclear warhead from the Montana and possibly detonate it, Coffey slowly starts to lose his judgment and reasoning, partially because of the HPNS and also because he's being saddled with an immense responsibility: to destroy anyone or anything that can be deemed a threat to the mission and to do it with a weapon that will destroy him along with the enemy. He's also cut off from his superior officer on the surface and has start making serious command decisions on his own. With reports of Soviet forces moving into the area, possibly to steal the warheads from the sub and after Lindsay insists she saw an alien, Coffey believes everything to be a threat. When the water tentacle appears, Coffey is convinced the NTIs are after the nuclear warhead that they salvaged, and insists they must be destroyed. The team is heavily opposed to the idea, and they become yet another threat to Coffey himself. And we can even throw in Lindsay's forceful personality itself: when she finds out that Coffey's team secretly brought the warhead onto the rig -- which she designed herself and considers her property -- she marches down to their quarters and bangs on door with a fire extinguisher and starts shouting at him.",
            "It's quite possible that Coffey himself had never gone to a depth of approximately 2000 feet before. Though he'd probably been diving before (and he couldn't very well be a US Navy SEAL without being certified to dive) this depth might have been what triggered his HPNS. Additionally, Coffey was placed under a tremendous amount of pressure by his commanding officer, Commodore DeMarco, when he was ordered to retrieve the nuclear warhead and arm it. There's a short scene where he's given the order just after the rig crew and his team make contact with the aliens AND he's told by his commanding officer that a Soviet submarine might be in the area. At that point, DeMarco tells him to go into war mode. Saddling a lieutenant with that much responsibility could also contribute to Coffey's psychosis.",
            "When a sub the size of the one Coffey is in implodes, the whole ordeal would happen in less than a microsecond. The air inside the sub would ignite and instantly vaporize his body in to dust. Therefore there wouldn't be any blood.",
            "Just like Lindsey says, swimming in freezing cold water can slow the body's metabolism drastically. This is called cold water drowning. There are rare but documented accounts of people surviving drowning for extreme lengths of time. One 18-year-old man survived for 38 minutes under water. Deep hypothermia is used in medicine, especially during surgeries which require stopping circulation for repairs, such as aortic arch reconstruction and giant cerebral aneurysm clippings. The body is cooled to less than 18 degrees Celsius (64.4 deg F) and the heart is stopped. Studies have shown this can be done up to 45 minutes without neural damage. According to the novelization of The Abyss, the NTIs preserved Lindsey's life because they had perceived her good nature through their first contact. A hint of this can be seen in the film as a blue glow that emanates from the moonpool after our heroes believe Lindsey is dead.",
            "Believing Bud to be dead at the bottom of the trench, Lindsey is astonished when he suddenly starts texting her again. \"Virgil Brigman back on the air,\" he types. \"Have some new friends down here.\" He goes on to explain that it bothers the NTIs to see us hurting each other and that they sent the tidal wave to us as a message. \"Hope you got it,\" Bud texts, then adds, \"Keep pantyhose on. You're going to love this.\" Suddenly, the Deepcore starts to rumble, and the Benthic Explorer on the surface begins receiving signals of something big rising to the surface right under them. As everyone watches in amazement, the alien vessel lifts the oil rig, the Benthic Explorer, and the rest of the naval fleet right out of the water, balancing them on its massive hull. The platform crew and remaining SEALs are surprised that they have been lifted to the surface without having to decompress, assuming that the NTIs \"did something to us.\" In the final scene, Bud exits the alien craft, and he and Lindsey walk to each other. \"Hi, Brigman,\" Lindsey greets him. \"Hi, Mrs Brigman,\" Bud replies and kisses her.",
            "A very elaborate ending was indeed scripted and filmed for the theatrical version of The Abyss. It starts off after Bud is saved by the aliens. They show him the news on a giant video wall about the imminent war between the USA and the Soviet Union. This changes into a special report about giant tidal waves that appear everywhere around the globe, threatening all mankind. Bud instantly understands that the aliens are responsible for these tsunamis, and he asks why they want to destroy mankind. They respond by showing him images of the many wars and atrocities committed by humans in their seemingly never-ending route to self-destruction. But, as the waves are about to hit the land, they stop and retreat; the aliens have stopped them. Bud's sacrifice has showed them that humanity may have the strength and wisdom to make it after all. The movie then ends with the spaceship rising up towards the ocean surface.This ending, together with many other deleted scenes, was restored in the Special Edition of The Abyss. The reason that these scenes were deleted from the earlier version is that they would have made the movie almost 3 hours long. In those days, a running time that long was generally considered too big a commercial risk, especially for big-budget, action-packed, special effects-heavy blockbusters that have to earn a lot of money to break even, let alone make a profit. A general rule is that movies make the most money in the first week(s) or weekend after the premiere. A long running time has the disadvantage that cinemas can hold fewer screenings per day, which diminishes the box-office per day of showing. Furthermore, conventional wisdom at the time was that audiences were not very enthusiastic about remaining focused for such a long time, following the commercial failures of Novecento, Heaven's Gate and Once Upon a Time in America; a notion that was largely disproved since then, with many fine examples of 3-hour-plus movies that became huge box-office hits, e.g. Dances With Wolves, Lord of the Rings, James Cameron's own Titanic and Avatar. Also, it was originally released during the summer film season of 1989, albeit very late in the season, and most summer films then didn't run much longer than 2 hours.Contrary to what may be thought, the omission of the wave scene was not a studio decision; director James Cameron and producer Gale Anne Hurd had final cut as long as the movie was kept under an agreed-upon length of 135 minutes, and according to Cameron, the studio was even disappointed to see the wave scene go. However, the special effects of the scene had not been finished, and reactions from test audiences to the unfinished scene were mixed. So Cameron and Hurd were faced with the decision to either trim shots and parts of scenes away from other parts of the movie, or remove an entire subplot. They decided upon the latter, feeling that the first option would hurt the movie's focus and character development, and they also thought that the movie's theme still work without the wave scene, although less overtly. So the tidal wave scenes were never completely finished during post-production.However, a favourable response to the Special Edition of Cameron's Aliens in 1991 prompted him to revisit The Abyss in 1993 and restore the deleted scenes with fully-finished special effects and a slightly re-recorded soundtrack."

            "The out-of-universe answer is, it allowed the filmmakers to re-use the 1955 set (and actors) instead of making (and casting) a new one.The in-universe answer is, 'Old Biff' seems to regard 1955 as the year his fortunes took a turn for the worse: the year in which, among other things, he was refused by Lorraine and humiliated by George, and presumably began his decline into the working-class. To him, 1955 would have seemed the perfect opportunity to save himself from those mishaps.\nIt's not out of the realm of possibilities that he could have had other people (such as his grandma) place some minor bets for him before he turned 21. So he would then have significant funds to start betting with when he turned 21.Also, Biff, not being the brightest bulb in the chandelier (ie: George doing his homework in 1955 and office work in 1985), may have been allowed to finish the academic year after turning 21 as a senior.",
            "When Doc sees Marty off, he warns of 'A few short-circuits in [Griff's] bionic implants'. This is usually understood as a slur on Griff's intelligence or sanity, or a warning against his short temper; but the \"robotic\" sounds suggest a joke on taking the idiom literally.",
            "As a filmmaking choice, this consists with the end of BTTF I, in which Doc re-appears within hours of his departure, to recruit Marty for the new adventure. This also preserves (ironically) the dramatic unity of time (a late-neoclassical or early post-neoclassical convention), such that the entire trilogy depicts the events of a few days.As a plot-device, the use of 1985 Marty enables Doc to have that Marty impersonate his (Marty's) son, and refuse Griff. The 2015 Marty is never shown speaking with his son, and is implied throughout to be very much distracted from his wife and children; and moreover, is as easily swayed as his son (by the minor villain 'Douglas J. Needles'), to take the blame for the crimes of others. He would therefore seem unreliable to Doc.",
            "Considering how rich and powerful Biff was, and George having been recently deceased; she likely married him for financial security. He likely promised her he'd take care of her children and secure their futures. So despite her despising Biff, she felt marrying him was beneficial for her kids. As we see, Biff uses that relationship as leverage to control Lorraine. When she threatens to leave him, he says he'll financially cut off her and her kids.",
            "In 2020, a fan of the BTTF trilogy tried to explain this paradox.Short version: statistics in the 2015 almanac should be modified with each change of events, just like the USA Today newspaper in 2015, at the beginning of the movie, shifted from a cover with Marty's son arrested, to a cover with Griff and his gang arrested (the content of the newspaper probably shifted as Well).In that manner, 1955 Biff Tannen should always have the winners of every sport event till the end of the century, no matter if gambling rules of other external factors were altered.",
            "Yes, If he were to remember that in 30 years. He may be able to remember the events which took place during the movie in 30 years but you would imagine the majority of his memories would be based around the Almanac itself as opposed to the reason why he purchased it in the first place. Don't forget that he only spends a day in 2015 but at the end of the film immediately goes on to spend a week in 1885.",
            "It could be a simple foreshadowing trope since he conveniently had something on hand to subsequently destroy the almanac and then it morphs from Biff's casino to his auto detailing business. Marty didn't smoke, wasn't a pyromaniac nor could he have known he would actually retrieve the almanac. As with the USA Today that Doc had, it may have been taken as a indicator that history did change if he did destroy it.It's implied that he picked up the matchbook simply to look at it when Biff's back was turned. When Biff turned to face him, Marty quickly pocketed the matchbook. Why Marty felt the need to hide his taking of a matchbook isn't known. But it could have just been a hurried reaction in a tense situation.",
            "Doc was adamant about not altering the past, which in turn alters the future. However we see that after the events of the first film, Doc decided \"what the hell...\" and read the letter that Marty wrote him about his fate in 1985. It's likely that Doc's perspective changed slightly and felt that one event in Marty's life completely destroyed his family and felt that he should help Marty if he could by altering one event.If Doc was really interested in completely changing Marty's life, he could simply tell Marty what happens to him so Marty could make better choices. Instead he opts not to change Marty's life but his children's.",
            "Old Biff had as much time as he wanted to figure out how it worked. It could have taken him hours or even days to figure out, and all he had to do was to return to Hilldale in 2015 just after he left. We never see Marty and Doc return with Jennifer to find the Delorean gone, but Biff couldn't have gone back to 1955, give his younger self the almanac, and return it on time. Turning on the time circuits is not a laborious task. Punching in the date should also be a very easy thing to do as the digital time and dates are clearly marked and there's a key pad clearly visible. If he didn't get it right the first time, he could try again (as Doc did at the start of BTTF I). Operating the time machine is so easy that Marty accidentally traveled to 1955 in BTTF I. Biff would not have known to travel to 88 miles per hour (MPH), but most likely sped up until he reached the precise speed needed to activate the time displacement.The Mr. Fusion question requires some speculation. At the end of BTTF I (or beginning of BTTF II), Doc powers Mr. Fusion using trash. However, it is never stated that Mr. Fusion is needed to be powered after every time travel trip. One load could likely last several trips. Some people assume the need to refuel, because Doc powers Mr. Fusion before returning from 2015 to the alternate 1985. It is also implied that Doc has made several trips in 2015. We don't know if Doc powered Mr. Fusion every trip he made. We also don't know when Doc got Mr. Fusion to power the time circuits. (It was probably when he first entered 2015 so he wouldn't need plutonium anymore.) So we don't know for sure whether Mr. Fusion is needed for every single trip. If this is true, then Biff would have no trouble going to 1955 and then back to 2015. It is also very likely that Mr. Fusion is a relatively common appliance in 2015, evidenced by its design and signs of branding. Therefore 2015 Biff may be familiar with the device. Also, even if Biff needed to refuel, all Mr. Fusion takes is garbage to fuel it. Therefore, he likely had no problems finding fuel in 1955.In the re-shooting of the DeLorean's departure from 1985 that took place in order to incorporate Elizabeth Shue, \"less old\" Biff witnessed the departure and may have known to accelerate, if not the precise speed he needed to reach.",
            "Einy (Einstein), being the first time traveler, does not bump into his future self. This is due to the fact Einy does not go back to his original time (albeit only one minute). There is one Einy before the time travel, zero Einsteins during the following minute, then one Einy again when he \"arrives\". Marty and Jen do see themselves in 2015. However, they do eventually get back to 1985 (their original time), so can exist in the future, just like Einy in Part I but unlike Marty and Jen in Part III. Doc does not return to his original time, but instead decides to stay in 1885 in Part III, so he would not and does not exist 30 years into the future. 30 years after the events of the trilogy, Marty and Jennifer would be 48 and living out their lives in 2015, whereas Doc would be 95 (but with the vigor of a person aged from 55 to 65) and living out his life in 1915 (or in whatever year to which he might time-visit or even time-migrate). As a time traveler with access to a rejuvenation caveat, Doc's fate (as well as the fates of his life-long companions, e.g. Clara and Einstein) is a little more arbitrary than the other characters' or ordinary folks'.",
            "Marty successfully burns the Almanac while Doc hovers overhead in the DeLorean as the storm breaks out. As the Almanac burns, Marty notices that the logo on Biff's matchcover changes from \"Pleasure Paradise\" to \"Auto Detailing.\" The newspaper heading changes from \"George McFly Murdered\" to \"George McFly Honored\". Marty calls Doc with the good news that things are reverting back to the reality they knew before. Doc checks the headline on his newspaper and sees it revert from \"Emmett Brown Committed\" to \"Emmett Brown Commended\". Suddenly, a bolt of lightning strikes the DeLorean, and it vanishes. Marty tries to call Doc on his cell, but there is no answer. Moments later, a car pulls up, and a man gets out. He informs Marty that he is from Western Union and has a letter for Marty that they have been holding for the past 70 years with instructions to deliver it at that exact location on that exact date and time. Marty opens the letter, which is signed, \"Your friend, 'Doc' Emmett L. Brown.\" Doc says that he's now living in the year 1885 in the Old West. Utterly alone in the 1955 timeline, Marty can think of only one person who can help him, the 1955 Doc who is currently in the town square helping Marty's counterpart get back to 1985. In the final scene, Marty runs up to 1955 Doc and totally surprises him. Doc has just sent the yesterday Marty back to the future. Marty replies that he's back from the future, and Doc faints. The words \"To Be Concluded\" appear on screen, and then a montage of scenes from Back to the Future Part III are shown."

He almost falters at the second trap when he realizes that he must step only on the stones that spell out God's name (Jehovah) until he remembers that the first letter in Latin is actually \"I\" (not \"J\"). On the third trap, in which he must cross a deep chasm, he is forced to step down onto a bridge that was disquised to be invisible. At the end of the path, he encounters a table covered in numerous chalices and the Knight who has been guarding them for 700 years. By following Indy, Donovan and Elsa catch up, but Donovan is perplexed by all the chalices and allows Elsa to pick the proper one for him. She chooses an ornate gold one, he drinks from it, and promptly dies. \"He chose poorly,\" comments the Knight. Indy chooses a plain wooden cup, as would be made by a carpenter, and drinks from it. \"You have chosen wisely,\" says the Knight, so Indy fills it with water and lets Henry drink from it. Henry is immediately cured, but Elsa grabs the cup for herself and tries to leave the temple, setting off a massive earthquake. Elsa and the cup fall into a fissure. When Indy tries to pull her out, she tries to grab for the fallen cup, but her glove slips off her hand and she falls into the precipice. In the final scene, Indy, Henry, Marcus, and Sallah leave the temple, mount their horses, and ride away. but not before Henry reveals that, although Henry is his junior, he got the named \"Indiana\" after the family dog.",
            "Yes. You can see Elsa becoming increasingly disturbed by Donovan's actions over the course of the film, particularly after the shoot-out with the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword. The final straw was most likely when Donovan shot Henry Jones to ensure Indy's cooperation.When Elsa chooses the cup on Donovan's behalf, she gives him a quick smile, which looks very much forced, and is probably meant to give him a false sense of security that she will pick the correct Grail. Also, after she gives Donovan the cup, a gold chalice inlaid with jewels, she looks at Indy and subtly shakes her head. And when Donovan starts to feel sick from drinking from the wrong cup, her expression is not surprised at all, as if she thinks this is exactly what he deserves. When Indiana then starts to look for the genuine Grail, Elsa states that it would not be made out of gold, indicating that she had deliberately given Donovan the wrong cup.",
            "At the heart-pounding hanging moment in the film where Indy is reaching for the grail, he stops because his father, for the first time in the entire movie, calls him \"Indiana,\" instead of \"Junior.\" Indy just got caught up in the moment of wanting the grail, which he didn't really seem to desire previously. Indy realized at the moment when his father called him \"Indiana\" that his own real search in the film was not for the holy grail, but for the relationship he'd always wanted with his father. It wouldn't have been worth it for Indy to have kept on striving for the grail just as the Nazis and Elsa had done and failed, risking his life and his father's; the grail just revealed each person's own greed.",
            "For Dr Jones Sr, the quest itself and the knowledge that the Grail actually existed was satisfying enough -- he got to drink from it and actually hold it. He clearly enjoys the adventure his son takes him on, with the exception of a few bumps along the way, and he was able to reconnect with Indy after such a long period of non-communication with him.",
            "No. The easiest way to think of the Holy Grail is not as the cup of immortality, but as the fountain of youth. One sip won't make you immortal; you have to keep drinking from it. That would explain why the knights who left the cave after drinking from the Grail eventually died of extreme old age. Nothing in the film states that one becomes immortal by drinking from the Grail one time, and if that were the case, it would be difficult to explain those knights' deaths. The grail knight does say that the grail itself cannot pass beyond the great seal, for that is the price of immortality. The meaning is that, if you wish to be immortal, you have to stay in that cave for eternity with the grail. Therefore, they are not immortal. Additionally, we see in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull that Henry Jones, Sr. has indeed passed away in the time since the events of Last Crusade."

The Sioux reluctantly accepted Dunbar's decision. Stands with a Fist also decided to leave together with Dunbar.",

Dunbar leaves his post and joins the Sioux, he's seen as a traitor. His rescue and killing of all guards would obviously be seen as an unforgettable taunt and a real threat.Among this real reason to send an even bigger army to fight them, this would also be the opportunity needed for anybody wanting to actively fight the natives, or wanting to lead an army and increase in ranks.Knowing all that, Dunbar decided to leave the tribe, surrender, and use that to talk about a truce and how good people the natives are, to anybody that would listen to it. In this action, he both removes the motivation to raid them, and creates the chance to make European people learn about them.Stands with a Fist, as his wife, goes with him.

There is a clue early in the film when Lieutenant Garber mentions a \"last minute replacement\" to Colonel Stuart after using his radio in an airport phone booth, presumably to contact Major Grant. This \"replacement\" was Telford, who later tells McClane he had been drafted in only the day before, as a necessity (Blue Light's regular radio operator having appendicitis).

        ],
        "answers": [
            "While not a lot is explained, there are moments in the movie where certain rules are mentioned regarding how Ghosts operate and how the afterlife works.The golden rule is that you become a ghost when you die. But here's where things get complicated.For starters who goes where:\nIf you have been a good person in your life leading up to your eventual death, you will be guided to a paradise hosted by small beings of light. Whether they are angels, elementals or another type of being altogether is uncertain, but what is certain is you are better off going with them. So be good.If you were a bad person in life and have no chance to redeem yourself prior to your death or any remorse from your crimes; thats when what the Hospital Ghost describes as \"The Other Ones\". Beings that emerge from the very shadows. Whether they are demons, dark ones is not quite explained, but once they get a hold of you, they drag you into the very shadows they emerge from.Now here's where things get murky. While it mostly applies to good people that die, whenever a ghost has unfinished business or feels they have unfinished business, they can choose to reject passing on to the next world. As shown when Sam was offered an opportunity to ascend with the light beings, but chose to stay in order to protect Molly and find out more about his murder. Once completed, the ghost is able to move on. It is unknown if the same applies to bad people, however it appears unlikely. As shown when the shadow beings made their move, not too long after Carl and Willie realized they have died.Then there's the abilities of a ghost:\nGhosts are intangible. Their basic ability is to walk through walls and other solid objects and beings. In their POV, the ability also doubles as a crude version of X-Ray Vision. As seen when Sam's first walk through showed him seeing the exact intricate details of the human anatomy of the doctor who was wheeling his body to the morgue.-They have the ability to communicate with living beings that have a heightened or extra sense of awareness. This was first demonstrated when Sam realized his pet cat could sense his presence. Which he later used to scare off Willie when he catches him breaking into Molly's home. This also applies to some humans who have what is referred to as \"The Gift.\"\n-They have the ability to manipulate objects in the physical world. While an inexperienced Ghost can't move objects because their bodies easily move through them. Through training, they are able to manipulate objects and touch people. The Subway Ghost describes it as realizing you're ghostly form is nothing more than your mind and emotions manifested into a physical form of energy and through concentration that energy can be used to manipulate objects. From moving chairs, to breaking windows, to even punching a living human being as Sam demonstrated on Willie and Carl.\n-They have the ability to possess the living. Ghosts are able to, through the same method as manipulating objects possess living humans and use them as a vessel for proper communication and physical contact. As demonstrated when a Ghost named Orlando possessed Oda Mae in order to communicate with his wife. However there is a consequence as possession causes the ghost to expend larger amounts of energy than simple manipulations. Which leaves them near powerless temporarily. As seen when after Sam possesses Oda Mae, he finds himself unable to fight Carl for a while.The Medium:\nThe Medium is one of a few humans who have the ability to communicate with Ghosts. How they are able to isn't fully explained, but there are certain things revealed about them.\nTheir abilities:\n-Their abilities or as Oda Mae refers to it \"The Gift.\" are hereditary. Passed down from parent to child. As heard from Oda Mae, who while she didn't believe she had it during her career as a con artist; made a note that her mother and grandmother before her had the gift.\n-They can hear the ghosts, but they can't see them. While they are the best chance for the ghosts to communicate with the living, even the mediums aren't powerful enough to see their form. When Oda Mae first meets Sam, she confuses both her sisters and her mark, because she could hear him, but not see him. When Sam forces her to help him warn Molly of Willie and Carl, she even asked for a picture of Sam to get a better sense of visualization of the person she is talking to. While it's not outright stated, it's implied her hearing of Sam is Telepathic in nature. As shown when, he wouldn't stop singing \"Henry the 8th.\". In an attempt to drown him out she put pillows over her ears, but it didn't even muffle the sound.\n-While it's unknown, it's implied that anyone can be a medium through Trauma. After Sam was able to prevent Carl from killing Molly and Oda Mae, before the light beings come to claim him, Molly was able to hear Sam. Whether this was because of the light beings, or her trauma heightened her awareness is unknown. The light beings however were most certainly responsible for revealing Sam's ghostly form to them prior to his ascension.Last but not least the rules regarding ordinary humans:\n-Ordinary humans often always cannot see or hear ghosts. However ghosts can make their presence known to them through their abilities. As shown when Sam was able to get Carl's attention in the bank by moving the chairs and accusing him on his computer. However since the majority of humans don't see, hear or even believe in ghosts; any reactions from those that know, would lead them to believe they went crazy. Case in point, when Sam tormented Willy to save Oda Mae. He did enough to make Willy believe that something invisible was after him. Reducing him to a scampering, screaming mess, right up until his own death. To the rest of the citizens, they thought he flipped out and killed himself.\n-No matter what, Humans can't harm ghosts. Aside from not being able to see or hear them, humans have the disadvantage of being unable to attack ghosts physically. Even if it were possible, because they couldn't see ghosts, a human wouldn't be able to hit or throw a solid object at them. As seen when Carl tried to hurl a crane hook at Sam, which missed him. The closest thing to harm they can bring is when they are possessed, as that uses up too much energy.",
            "Carl was working for drug dealers as a money launderer and Carl hired Willie to mug Sam. However, Willy killed Sam which Carl didn't hire him to do and Carl planned to steal $4 million to pay back his superiors. When Oda Mae with Sam's guidance withdrew the $4 million, Carl went to Molly's apartment and threatened to kill Molly and threatened Oda Mae at gunpoint. Upon his death, the dark shadows dragged Carl's ghost to hell for his sins."

Connie was furious with Michael for this and hated him for making her a widow and her children fatherless.

            "Before the helicopter attack wipes out much of the American Mafiosos (called in the movie universe, the Commission) there is a scene where Michael and Vincent are talking on another helicopter heading to Atlantic City. Michael comments that Joey Zasa is just a two-bit punk who doesn't have the muscle nor the brains.The man who is the 'mastermind' behind the plot against the Corleone Family's attempt to legitimize themselves with the Vatican and the Real Estate Company deal is a businessman named Lido Lucchese. He is first introduced in the meeting scene at the Vatican City as the man stating 'all our ships must sail in the right direction' to Michael. He is revealed as the mastermind behind the whole plot when he meets with Don Oswaldo Altobello and Vincent in Sicily. He is killed at the climax of the movie, in typical Godfather style with showing other murders being committed (including Pope John Paul the First), by being stabbed graphically in the throat with his own glasses after a warning is whispered in his ear by one of Michael's assassins.",

            "Predominantly, it's the same movie, just with a more cleaned-up look, like the special editions of the Original Trilogy of Star Wars.

It also omits the ceremony sequence where Michael is granted the Order of Saint Sebastian.The Ending: The ending is mostly the same. After the climax at the Opera and Mary's Death, the scene cuts to Michael quietly living alone at an estate, presumably in Corleone, Sicily. Instead of him collapsing dead and dropping an orange, he remembers (in flashbacks) various dances he has attended with various characters, mainly Kay and Mary, who he has now lost forever (presumably his attempts to make up with Kay Adams were ruined since it was by his actions that Mary died). He puts on his sunglasses and fade to a black screen, where a phrase is posted in English. Said phrase essentially summarizes that Michael is just a broken and lonely man shattered by his ambitions and attempts and is left alone to suffer and be tormented by his memories, good and bad, which he has complete recognition of.",
            "While they definitely look like members of the Ku Klux Klan, the four men who hold up the statue of the Virgin Mary or Madonna in the Italian-American Festival in Little Italy are NOT members of the Klan.

            "The Main Villain is Licio Lucchesse, an Italian Businessman who is a high-ranking member of the group of Catholic Businessmen on the Board of Vatican Directors who are opposed to doing business with Michael Corleone. He first prominently appears in the Vatican after the announcement of the current pope's poor health and he prominently threatens Michael by stating that 'all the ships must sail in the same direction'. Presumably, aside from not wanting to officially associate with Mafiosos, even former ones, like Michael Corleone, Luchhese is involved with using Vatican money to handle various business deals and doesn't want to be involved with the eventual scandal when it is exposed. Thus he wants a scapegoat to basically cover his tracks and that is Michael Corleone. He is killed during the Opera Climax by Carlo, who drives the man's instantly recognizable rimmed glasses into his neck, causing him to bleed out.The prominent accomplices of Lucchese are revealed to be a mafioso and very close ally of the Corleone family known as Oswaldo Altobello, who is Connie's godfather and an old ally of Vito Corleone's when he was becoming a powerful figure in organized crime in New York through bootlegging and other crimes. Altobello is killed while attending the opera by choking on a poisoned dessert brought to him by Connie.Archbishop Gilday is basically the fall guy for Lucchese's business deals conducted with Vatican funds. He attempts to prevent the impending audit by recently-appointed Pope John Paul the First (Who is the same Cardinal who hears Michael's confession in the film) by poisoning the Holy Father's tea successfully. Moments after the assassination, he is found by Rocco, and killed by being thrown down a flight of stairs.The third accomplice is Keinzig, the moustached Swiss banker who helped handle the Vatican Money with Gilday. He goes on the run with a lot of money stolen from the Vatican Bank, leaving Gilday to take the fall, and is eventually found and hanged by Vincent's men. Interestingly, the scene where Keinzig is found hanged is inspiration for a scene in Terry Gilliam's Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, where Heath Ledger's character is found hanged, and it is steadily revealed that Ledger's character of Tony is similar to Keinzig.The final accomplice to Lucchese is Mosca, a dangerous assassin who poses as a priest to assassinate Michael at the opera. However, despite killing several of Michael and Vincent's men, he is unsuccessful and kills Mary before being shot himself.",

The last time Billy was seen was at the party with Jimmy, Henry and Tommy, and earlier Tommy became enraged and tried to pick a fight with Billy. There were witnesses to this from both sides so it's also likely that Tommy was known to be the main culprit by Billy's crew.Seeing as how Billy was a made man (you cannot kill a made man without express permission from a boss) and Tommy was not; Billy's crew felt they had enough reason to kill Tommy as retribution for Billy's disappearance.

            "There's a few possible reasons:1) Morrie had been pestering Jimmy for his cut of the Lufthansa heist money for ages. Jimmy decided to kill Morrie due to being annoyed at him. But they were all having such a good time and so many laughs at the poker game, Jimmy genuinely changed his mind about killing him. However, as soon as the night was over, Morrie immediately started pestering Jimmy again so Jimmy gave the signal to Tommy to whack Morrie.2) Jimmy always planned on killing Morrie and all the other loose ends in the Lufthansa heist instead of paying them. Morrie was simply going to be first, due to how annoying he was. Jimmy asked Henry to help him, but noticed how reluctant Henry was. So Jimmy told Henry to forget about it to unburden him.3) It was actually Henry who killed Morrie. We are told this story by Henry, as if he's on the witness stand. He says Jimmy asked him to help him kill Morrie, but Henry didn't want to. Henry then tells us that Jimmy changed his mind and it was a huge weight off Henry's shoulders. Yet we see Morrie was killed anyway. Given that Henry is a criminal and a liar, it's entirely possible he was involved in Morrie's death but it's not wise to openly admit you killed someone.",
            "This is covered by Henry's narration shortly after this scene. Stacks' role in the Lufthansa heist was to steal a panel truck then get it compacted afterwards to hide all trace. Instead he got stoned, overslept and the cops had found the truck in the meantime, and supposedly got fingerprints off the wheel. So it was only a matter of time before they got to Stacks, who would likely inform on the rest of the crew.",

            "Like Henry says to Karen during their argument when she visits, \"This is what happens when you 'go away,'\" i.e., when a wiseguy is sent to prison: you lose your support base in the mob, so Paul refused to help Henry's family out. The reason is never fully explained, but it's probably because Paul and other mob enforcers don't want to draw attention to the relationship they have with a convicted criminal like Henry or Jimmy. In light of that, the only way Henry could find (aside from working in the prison metal shop, etc.) to support Karen and his girls was to deal drugs in prison. Don't forget, Henry and his friends always considered themselves above manual labor or 9 to 5-type jobs, so Henry would look for an easy way to \"put food on the table\". Also, dealing drugs would earn Henry far more money than working in the prison would. Paulie tells Henry, in the backyard during the family dinner after Henry's released from prison, \"I don't want any more of that shit... just stay away from the garbage... I'm not talking about what you did inside. You did what you had to do.\" And, as we see, Henry doesn't listen to Paul's orders.Paulie doesn't have an ethical issue with drugs, or want Henry to avoid dealing for Henry's sake. Paulie just doesn't want the risks that Henry dealing dope brings to HIM (Paulie). In prison, where the C.O's are on the mob's payroll, and they live in a tightly-controlled environment, where they're at the top of the food chain, and Henry's only dealing direct to users (so grams, not kilo's or pounds), that risk to Paulie is minimal. But on the streets, things are different- Henry's importing and wholesaling. So MUCH bigger quantities (and more intense police scrutiny, harsher sentences if busted) than the grams he was selling in prison. There are dozens of police agencies Henry may run afoul of, with officers who AREN'T under mob control. Paulie isn't sharing a living-space, where he can watch, and potentially control Henry, and get a feel for whether Henry's using/how out-of-control his using is. There are rival dealers, disgruntled customers, drama with suppliers. A thousand different, unpredictable ways that things can go wrong (and draw heat to Paulie), that are beyond Paulie's control.Basically, Henry selling as a side-hustle in prison poses little risk to Paulie. But Henry importing and wholesaling kilos at a time, in the uncontrolled environment of the streets, makes Henry a liability to Paulie, likely to bring police attention that he can't squash, to the family. Also, if Henry gets caught, the time he's facing is significant, which would be more likely that Henry would co-operate with the police against Paulie. In the end, that's exactly what happens.",
            "Karen initially went to see Jimmy to tell him that Henry had recently cleaned up his act, mostly having to do with getting him off the cocaine. She also seems to be handing him some documents, probably copies of documents that Henry had gotten from his lawyer. Jimmy also wanted to know what Henry had been talking about regarding the criminal charges of drug possession and manufacture, i.e., Jimmy wanted to see if Henry had told the police or his lawyer anything that might incriminate Jimmy himself or any of their fellow gang members. The reason he had Karen walk by the shopfront with the two shady-looking guys in it was specifically to scare and rattle her. It was likely meant as a reminder to Karen (and ultimately to Henry) that the Mafia can \"get to anyone\" or threaten them. Jimmy's plan clearly works since we see that Karen is quite upset when she gets home.",
            "It's an old film and tv technique called \"breaking the fourth wall.\" Traditionally, a film or TV set is a closed world where the \"fourth wall\", i.e., the TV screen or film screen, is never addressed by the actors or characters in a show. By having Henry tell us directly that he was sad to be leaving the easy-going criminal life of a mobster, Scorsese makes the scene much more dramatic.",

            "He heard the sound it made when it passed the October and determined it was high-pitched and had to be Russian. Jones, a sonar expert, has an incredible gift for identifying underwater sounds that we've seen demonstrated throughout the movie. He probably has also read and studied up extensively on Russian armaments like the torpedoes they use and in his time working as a sonar guy, must have heard or read that Russian torpedoes are higher-pitched because they use different mechanical components or they simply move faster.",
            "Ramius' political officer Ivan Putin (Peter Firth) was the only one that Ramius had not personally handpicked for his inner circle. Since the political officer knew what the original orders were and would have recognized as fake the orders that Ramius subsequently substituted, Ramius had to dispense with him. The Senior officers even discuss this, it being pointed out that his death was justified as the distrusted and (by at least one officer disliked) Putin would have actively tried to prevent the defection",
            "Two reasons. Ramius wanted to defect because of the circumstances surrounding his wife's death a year before the story opens. What happened to his wife is not shown in the movie but talked about in depth in the book. She was killed because the corruption of the Soviet system allowed a drunk doctor (the son of a Politburo member) to operate on her with poor quality drugs and, as a result, she died from a simple operation. This showed Ramius the corruption of the Soviet system. The other reason is that Marko hates the cold war, its cost on the lives of him and his men, and above all else he wants to avoid a real war. Marko knows that the Red October was created as a \"first strike\" weapon to get a first nuclear strike on America in event of a war, and therefore give them a significant advantage in the war and increase the odds of it happening. When Marko and his friend are talking about what they want for the future, Marko talks about the peace he enjoyed when fishing as a young man. Marko states earlier that he came up with his plan (to defect) when he saw the plans for the Red October. He steals the Red October to prevent the Russian government from being able to use it to start a war.",
            "The American bigwigs knew that Ramius sent a letter to his wife's uncle, Admiral Yuri Illyich Padorin, after which the majority of the Soviet naval force was ordered to hunt down the Red October and destroy it. Their first assumption was that Ramius was a rogue, intending to attack the U.S. under his own volition. Then Jack Ryan remembered that it was the first anniversary of Ramius' wife's death. It dawned on Ryan that another explanation for Ramius taking a course for the American coast and for the Soviet fleet to issue orders to destroy the sub was because the letter Ramius sent to Padorin contained his intention to defect.",
            "Ryan was sending a message from the Dallas by way of Morse code with flashing lights on the periscope. Ramius saw the message from the Red October. Ryan requested that Ramius acknowledge the message with a single ping, so Ramius ordered the sonar ping in order to verify the range to the other submarine (which was just an excuse he gave). The crew on the Red October did not know that Ramius was responding to a message sent from the Dallas.",
            "The exchange of cigarettes between military men in the field is often seen in films as a sign of good will.Also, Ryan looks pretty nervous in the scene: tensions are very high in the situation with the two submarines maintaining their high alert status while they try to have a peaceful diplomatic exchange aboard the October. Ryan has been in other very tense situations before when he was an active duty Marine but nothing quite like this: a meeting between two factions, the Soviet Union and the United States at the height of the cold war, aboard a submarine carrying enough fire power to wipe out a significant portion of the United States. Ryan also probably wanted the cigarette to calm his nerves.",
            "After successfully dodging the Russian topedo by speeding at it head on before it can arm itself, Ramius notes that Captain Tupolev won't make that mistake again and prepares for battle. Suddenly, gunfire erupts, fatally wounding Ramius' first officer Vasily Borodin with a bullet meant for Ramius. The as-yet unidentified sniper runs into the missile bay, intending to rig a missile in order to blow up the Red October. He is followed by Ryan and Ramius, who takes a bullet in the shoulder. Ryan continues going after the saboteur whom he identifies as Loginov, the Red October's cook, just before he shoots him. Meanwhile, the Konovalov has fired a live torpedo at the Red October. With the help of the Dallas, the Red October takes evasive measures, causing the torpedo to search out another ship, finally settling on the Konovalov, blowing it out of the water. The President's national security adviser, Jeffrey Pelt, explains to Soviet ambassador Andrei Lysenko that recovery of the Red October wreckage is too difficult at this time but that the crew is safe and will be returned to the Soviets. Lysenko mentions that the Konovalov has also been lost. Some time later, Ramius, Ryan, Mancuso, Melekhin, and the Red October head up the Penobscot River in Maine. Ryan assures Ramius that this is the last place satellites will ever try to look for the sub. 'Welcome to the New World, sir,' Ryan then says to Ramius. In the final scene, Ryan flies back to London with Stanley's new baby brother.",
            "The book explains this a bit better than the movie. Loginov was GRU (Glavnoye razvedyvatel'noye upravleniye), which was the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Soviet Union. He was secretly assigned to the Red October on her maiden voyage and remained under cover as a cook's assistant. This is hinted at early in the film. When Ramius is speaking with his Political Officer, he says, \"How many agents did the KGB put aboard my boat?\" To which the officer responds, \"...If the KGB or the GRU has agents aboard, I would be the last to know.\"",
            "The novel reveals that before leaving Murmansk, Loginov was briefed by his military intelligence superiors on the details of the Red October's official orders (that it was to rendezvous with the Konovolov). Thus, when Ramius announced over the ship's P.A. system that their orders were to sail to New York to conduct missile drills, there was a shot of Loginov in the galley with a perplexed look on his face. This was a subtle foreshadow that Loginov knows that the real orders were not being followed. That announcement, coupled with the \"accidental\" death of the political officer and then witnessing Ramius removing and keeping the second missile key, compelled Loginov to sabotage the caterpillar drive.",
            "He only did one - the initial sabotage of the caterpillar drive, so he had probably been trained on how to remove the \"buffer circuit\" the Chief Engineer (the tall, thin guy dressed in red) shows to Ramius and Borodin. Loginov was shown at least that one sabotage method (he may have had a few others) so that he could stop the sub in case of an emergency that countermanded the original orders. As the Chief says, it was done in a way that wasn't easy to find or investigate.All the other sabotage procedures with the reactor plant and caterpillars were done by the Chief under Captain Ramius' orders. These were done in a controlled way to cause fear and panic among the non-defecting crew as part of Ramius and his senior staff's cover story. The only other sabotage the Loginov tried was at the end when he tried to set off a \"range safety package\" (RSP) on one of the missiles. An RSP is normally on board a test missile so if something goes wrong and the missile heads off course, they can self destruct the missile. On operational missiles, the RSP is normally removed to prevent the intentional destruction by the enemy in-flight to targets. It is explained in the book that an RSP was left installed on one missile for the purpose of being a self destruct device for the whole sub in case of just such an emergency requiring destruction of the sub. Loginov, being a GRU agent, was taught how to do this.Fortunately, Jack Ryan shoots him before he is able to touch the wires together and blow up the Red October.",
            "In the book the US president personally plays a leading role in the events and several other US submarines and a Royal Navy aircraft carrier are also involved in the search. There is a subplot involving an American spy in the Kremlin who provides NATO with the details of the Soviet fleet's mission to sink the Red October and another with a KGB spy who is turned by the FBI and used to relay false information back to the Soviets. We see the Soviet Politburo discuss the information but there is no scene where the Red October has to evade an air-dropped torpedo and the GRU agent on board never sabotages the caterpiller drive. Ryan never boards the USS Dallas which never receives any orders to sink the Red October whilst another Soviet submarine is destroyed by a reactor accident during the hunt. Following the fake radiation leak the Soviet crew are conveyed from the Red October by an American Deep Sea Rescue Vehicle mini-submarine (DSRV) rather than abandoning ship and presume that Ramius and the officers scuttled the vessel in order to prevent it falling into American hands. The evacuated crew never witness any of its combat with the Soviet Alfa class submarine which is sunk by the Red October ramming it rather than the USS Dallas luring its own torpedo onto it. An obsolete US Navy submarine is then blown up in the spot where the Red October was supposed to have exploded in order to provide wreckage that will convince the Soviets that their boat is definitely destroyed."

When Verna tries to guess that in the dream Tom chased the hat and then put it on his head \"but it wasn't a hat anymore and it changed into something else, something wonderful\" (seemingly implying a crown), Tom bluntly tells her he didn't chase it and it stayed a hat. Therefore, the dream may foreshadow that Tom has no real ambition to betray Leo, symbolically rejecting the crown (power) to keep his hat (his own personal status and identity).

            "No. The movie's opening scenes clearly show that he was alone on the mountain road when he started skidding. However, just before his car runs off the cliff, Annie's vehicle can be seen approaching from the opposite direction. Although Annie later admits that she knew he was at the Silver Creek Lodge, she was actually driving home from town while Paul was driving from the lodge into town. It's a case of crossing each others' paths at the right time. In the book, Annie reveals that she didn't even believe it was Paul Sheldon at first. Then she checks his driver's license and realizes it really is.In the novel, it's suggested that Annie had taken up residence near Sidewinder because she knew Paul would retreat to the area each time he wrote or was close to finishing a book.",
            "Viewers are torn on an answer to this question, some saying that she knew and that's why she knocked over the glass of wine, others saying she didn't know and the wine spill was an accident. The movie does not provide conclusive evidence in either direction. It reveals only that, at the time of the dinner, Annie knew Paul had been out of his locked bedroom because the ceramic penguin had been moved, but she doesn't yet know how he got out. During the dinner, in fact, she seemed to be genuinely under the impression that she was actually making headway with him. It wasn't until he got out the second time, looked at her scrapbook, and took the butcher knife that she realized he was plotting against her, so she searched his room and found the knife as well as the hairpin \"key\". Most viewers conclude that Annie did not notice the missing Novril after Paul's first outing, so she did not think he had laced her wine, concluding that the spill was most likely an accident caused by Annie's quick reaction after she knocked over the burning candle. As for the book, there's no clue there because the wine-spilling scene never happened. Paul does think of scenarios where he might be able to kill or wound Annie, one in which he contemplates putting some Novril into a tub of her ice-cream, but he rejects this on the basis that Novril has a very bitter taste that Annie would probably notice.",
            "Buster (Richard Farnsworth) and his charming wife Virginia (Frances Sternhagen) are characters made up for the movie. At first, Buster knows only that Paul Sheldon is the author of the Misery novels and has been staying at the Silver Creek Lodge working on a new book. After inspecting Paul's wrecked car, he concludes that someone pried open the car door to get him out. According to Buster, one possibility is that the bodies of both Paul and his savior will be found after the snow melts. The other is that Paul is alive somewhere. While he waits for the spring thaw, Buster decides to read the Misery novels. At one point in his reading, he comes across a quote that rings a bell: \"There is a justice higher than that of man. I will be judged by Him.\" The quote sounds familiar, so he pours through some archived newspaper articles until he notices the exact quote attributed to Annie Wilkes after her trial. That's when everything clicks, and he starts to suspect Annie.He's also given another minor clue from the general store manager, that Annie's been buying the paper Paul uses to write the book.",
            "Paul finishes the book and asks for his usual-a cigarette, matches to light it, and a glass of Dom P\u00e9rignon champagne. Annie brings them, but he sends her for a second glass so that she can share in the toast. While Annie is gone, Paul douses the entire manuscript with lighter fluid. When Annie returns, he taunts her, saying, \"Does she finally marry Ian or will it be Winthorne? It's all right here,\" and then sets it on fire. Annie goes ballistic and attacks Paul. In their fight, she falls and hits her head on his typewriter but gets up again as he tries to crawl away. He finally smashes her in the face with a cast-iron paperweight of a pig. In the epilogue (18 months later), Paul (using a cane) meets his agent (Lauren Bacall) in a restaurant to discuss his new book. As they discuss him writing a nonfiction book about his experience with Annie, a waitress looking exactly like Annie comes over and asks if he is Paul Sheldon. Her face changes, showing that she is not Annie, and she says, \"I'm your number one fan.\" Paul replies, \"That's sweet of you.\"",
            "In the movie, no. Paul burned that book. The new novel that he is presenting to his agent is titled The Higher Education of J. Philip Stone and is not a Misery book. In King's novel, however, Paul saved the actual manuscript by hiding it under the bed and substituting blank and rejected pages with just a title page on top to make Annie think that he was burning the actual manuscript. It was subsequently published as Misery Returns. However, the novel suggests that after publishing Misery Returns, Paul sinks into a deep depression following his experience with Annie that he tries to control with alcohol and he experiences a severe case of writer's block. By the end of the story, he finds himself inspired by a young boy carrying a skunk on the street near his home and furiously begins to write a new story.",
            "Those who have both seen the movie and read the book say that there are some big differences between them. The biggest one is that that the story in the book is set entirely in Annie's house. There's no subplot about Buster or Paul's agent, which serves to focus on the search for Paul. In the novel, Paul is pretty much on his own trying to get away from Annie. Annie is presented as more psychotic and her mood swings are accentuated. She cuts off one of Paul's feet with an axe rather than hobbling him when she finds out he'd gotten out of his room and also cuts off a thumb with an electric knife when he complains about the typewriter missing a letter. In the novel, Paul is addicted to Novril; not so in the movie. The ending in the novel is is quite different in that Paul saves his original manuscript and burns a stack of unused paper with only a cover sheet saying Misery's Return."

            "Perhaps the Predator saw King Willie as a kill that would bring him much honour, after all as the head of the Jamaican Drug gang he wielded much power. Or maybe King Willie thought the Predator was a mythical demon of sorts and openly challenged him to a duel. Either way it would give an insight to the Predator's culture.Also, as Leona says to Harrigan; \"First Danny, then King Willy and you were right there. He's playing with you, Mike.\"\nIt's possible the Predator simply followed Harrigan to the meeting and observed it. Once Harrigan left the predator killed Willie as a way of working his way up the ladder.",
            "It's never been officially confirmed that the Predator will only kill people who are armed. However, the Predator's vision tech is likely able to scan a person for hidden weapons and saw that Willie cane carried a blade, making Willie a worthy kill.",

Once City Hunter was defeated by Harrigan, the rest of the clan revealed themselves and carried away City Hunter's body. The Elder Predator then gives Harrigan the pistol as a sign of respect for defeating a member of his clan.",
            "In the first film, Mac managed to hit the Predator in the leg while it was cloaked. In Predator 2, Jerry unloads about three magazines at the Predator straight ahead in a train car, and he didn't appear to hit him once. A few times, the bullets even ricochet off the Predator's armor but seem almost as if they pass right through him or don't even touch him. Three theories have been suggested: (1) Jerry simply didn't hit him, perhaps aiming too high because he couldn't see the Predator properly, (2) the Predators have upgraded their cloaking technology to help deflect bullets, and (3) the Predators' skins are tough enough to withstand 9mm, .40, or .45 cal handgun rounds but not strong enough to withstand the far more powerful 5.56mm or 7.62mm rounds commonly used in automatic rifles and carbines or 12-gauge slug rounds in Harrigan's shotgun.",
            "Leona is in the very early stages of pregnancy, as the Predator's scan and the paramedics confirm. Similar to the reason the predator spared Vega's girlfriend, a pregnant woman would not be an honorable kill.",
            "Harrigan follows the Predator down an elevator shaft and through a hole in the bottom, landing in an underground chamber. When he notices the skulls and spinal cords decorating the wall, he realizes that he is in the Predator's spaceship. Suddenly, he is attacked by the Predator who easily bats Harrigan around. When the Predator advances for another attack, Harrigan thrusts the throwing disc into his stomach, ripping him open and killing him. Suddenly nine more Predators uncloak, surrounding him, but they do not attack. Two of them carry off the body of their fallen comrade, and all but one files out of the room. The last one presents Harrigan with a antique flintlock pistol engraved Raphael Adolini 1715. \"Take it,\" says the Predator as he walks away. Harrigan can hear the spaceship's engines starting up, so he runs from the chamber and out into a tunnel. The ship blasts off and away, leaving Harrigan covered in ashes. As he slowly walks out of the tunnel, a helicopter lands and one of Keyes' assistants asks what happened, but Harrigan does not reply. \"Damn it, we came so close,\" the agent says. Harrigan looks at the flintlock and replies, \"You'll get another chance.\" In the final scene, police cars begin amassing as the helicopter takes off into the night sky.",
            "Harrigan was given the antique pistol by the Predator leader as a sign of respect and honour for defeating one of their own in combat. This is also why he was left unharmed. The pistol was from the year 1715 to show Harrigan (and the audience) that the Predators had been visiting Earth to hunt humans since at least that time, and that the first movie was not the first contact with humans after all. (There is also an 18th century storyline in the Predator prequel, \"Prey\" where the main charactern Naru acquires this pistol.) The notion that Predators have already visited Earth long before the events of Predator was already hinted at in the first movie, when Anna (Elpidia Carrillo) tells the story how some men from her village had disappeared, and were found without their skin. Also, Peter Keyes (Gary Busey) mentions to Harrigan that Predators have been sighted at many other sites of conflict within recent history, such as Iwo Jima (1945).",
            "The spaceship seemed to be there as a kind of Headquarters for the Predator aliens. Other than to hunt, no explanation is given as to their presence. Viewers have suggested that (1) each Predator was sent out to hunt. They all go hunting in various places at the same time or in close time frames in order to minimize the chance of being discovered. Once their hunt is complete, they return to the headquarters and head back into space. The predator in this film was simply the last to complete his hunt. (2) The ship was there to collect the Predator before his hunt was complete because he wasn't following the ritual and was being too high-profile.",
            "After the Predator's ship departs, Keyes' deputy Garber flies in by helicopter and questions Harrigan as to what happened. However police units begin to arrive at the scene in response to the massive explosion caused by the departure of the spaceship, and the government team leaves rather than risk an open confrontation with the LAPD and exposure to the media. We know that Keyes' unit is aware that the Predator will operate its self-destruct device when defeated, so they probably assume it is dead by its own hand.",
            "While the AvP films aren't considered canon, humanity is still unaware of the existence of the Predator species in the first film. It's likely Harrigan knows it would be pointless to start ranting and raving about an alien that killed all these gang members and his friends. He would simply be dismissed as a lunatic and any stories about the Predator would be dismissed as well. So Harrigan would probably keep his mouth shut and convince Leona to do so as well.There would be some physical evidence left behind. The Predator's mask, severed arm device, shoulder gun and his spear were all left on Earth. It's possible that Garber and his men would collect these items and cover up any traces of the Predator."

            "Yes. Cohaagan mentions near the end that he was part of the set-up to lead Doug to Mars.",
            "Dr. Edgemar shows up at Doug's hotel room, and even brings along Doug's wife in order to convince Doug that he's not actually on Mars, but at Rekall. Edgemar says that Doug is suffering a paranoid delusion based around his memory implant. Edgemar brings several valid arguments to Doug's attention, such as the fact that Doug lived a normal life all the way up until he went to Rekall. After that he has people trying to kill him left, right and centre, yet Doug himself is more or less invincible (as nobody manages to kill him). He then happens to get to Mars and meets an athletic brunette who is both sleazy and demure (exactly the woman Doug described at Rekall as being his preference and even the \"model\" that appeared on the screen was that of Melina) and so on. Doug, bordering on being convinced, tries one last time to call Edgemar's bluff and suggests that he could kill Edgemar and it won't matter because he isn't really there. Edgemar responds by saying that it won't make any difference to himself, but to Doug, Edgemar would be dead in the dream world, and with nobody to help guide Doug back to reality, Doug would slip into permanent psychosis, ending with him being lobotomized. Edgemar gets Doug to put a pill in his mouth (a symbol that he desires to go back to reality) and as he orders Doug to swallow it, Doug sees a single bead of sweat trickle down the side of Edgemar's head. This sweating may not have any special significance (the real doctor Edgemar may have been sweating, which translated into his mental image inside Doug's head), but Doug takes this as a sign that Edgemar is lying: a memory implant would have no reason to sweat. In Doug's judgment, The Edgemar standing there is getting nervous due to Doug threatening him with a gun, and also afraid that Doug won't break, and therefore he is real. So Doug shoots Edgemar in the forehead and spits the pill out. It's also possible, if it was indeed a dream, that Doug's mind wanted to stay in the dream world and so he projects the bead of sweat on Edgemar's head so Doug has a reason to reject the truth and shoot Edgemar.",
            "This is the other possibility, and the facts also fit this explanation. The assumption is that Doug starts dreaming during the procedure at Rekall, and everything that happens before that is reality. Doug simply has dreams about Mars, because he sees daily news footage of the guerrilla war going on there, and that's why he unconsciously incorporates it into his nightmares. Dreaming about an unknown woman may simply be coincidence; we all dream about anonymous people, she may simply be someone he once crossed on the street or met in a store, and not a recollection of an earlier memory. Or perhaps an subconscious clue that Doug is not so happy in his relation with Lori after all (as dreams are often highly metaphoric). A subtle clue that Doug's later adventure will be a dream might be that Bob, the salesman from Rekall, seems to be hesitant to let Doug make a virtual trip to Mars. Maybe because the daily news keeps showing how violent the situation on Mars is, and he fears that this knowledge may negatively affect Doug's dream. Which is exactly what happens with Doug and what causes his dream to run out of control. Aside from that, Bob tells him how the dream will go; Doug being a secret agent, people firing guns at him, the suite at the Hilton, and at the end killing the bad guy, rescuing the girl and saving Mars. Dr. Lull mentions alien machinery, and the Rekall technician comments that Doug's dream is called Blue Skies on Mars. And on top of that, Milena's face is already one of the options he has to choose from; all very conspicuous.So the dream starts exactly when Doug is sedated in the chair at Rekall. The part where he wakes up, thinks he is Hauser and attacks the Rekall employees is the beginning of the dream. As Dr. Edgemar later confirms, Doug immediately had a schizoid embolism: his mind is reacting violently to the impant procedure; he is making the dream up as he goes, incorporating things and people he knows into the dream; this includes the procedure at Rekall, his wife Lori, Harry from work, Vilos Cohaagen, the Mars rebellion, and Milena from his dreams (although she could be an implant, as Doug chose her as his fantasy woman). People and things he doesn't know, like Richter and Benny, may be part of the original Ego Trip dream program. Due to the schizoid embolism however, Doug experiences extreme paranoia, thinking that he is a double agent whose memory has been erased, and who is hunted by almost everyone. Dr. Edgemar needs to intervene: he inserts a memory of himself in the dream and tries to convince Doug everything is the result of his imagination running wild; he even implants an image of Lori (the real one) to assure him. As happened in the Rekall office, Edgemar gives an outline of everything that is about to happen; saving the rebel cause, being Cohaagens bosom buddy, and the alien civilizations. Doug believes it for a minute, but then he sees Edgemar sweating. Now it can be speculated that Doug is so paranoid that he imagines the drop of sweat on Edgemar's head, practically giving himself a reason not to believe the doctor, and kill him. This is probably what Edgemar meant when he said that the \"walls of reality\" would come crashing down and Doug would be stuck in a permanent psychosis; Edgemar was Doug's only connection to reality, and by killing his only guide out, Doug ultimately rejects the real world and accepts the dream as reality, becoming permanently stuck inside an illusion. In this illusion, Lori immediately becomes a paranoid imagination again, attacking him and betraying him to Richter's men (the wall behind him even exploding, the walls literally crashing down around him). Doug plays out his dream, and in the end, the only way to get him back to the real world is by lobotomizing him, which is what happens when we see the flash of light.Another distinct possibility (and probability) is that Doug had, in fact, visited Rekall once before, and that the movie itself follows his 2nd attempt at enjoying the Ego Trip, unbeknownst to him. Reason being, is that his memory of the 1st attempt was erased by Rekall as an illegal cover-up of their failure and nearly lobotomizing him. Hence Bob being very uneasy when Doug revisits Rekall and requests the Mars trip yet again. Bob puts on a smiley face and acts cool around Doug, maintaining his professional composure, so as to not tip Doug off that he's been there once already, especially considering what happened the previous time. So Bob tries to discourage Doug from Mars and coax him into trying out a different memory implant instead (so as to avoid the same outcome as last time). But of course, Doug doesn't budge. He wants Mars. After that, Bob thinks for a moment, and against his better judgement, reluctantly decides to accommodate Doug a 2nd time. Later, when Doug goes berserk, and is resedated, Bob states that he's just re-enacting the secret agent portion of his Ego Trip, and the doctor's rebuttal is they had not implanted it yet. Therefore, somewhere deep within Doug's subconscious, the original failed implant still existed. So, after failing twice now, they erase Doug's memory of ever going to Rekall and then create a mandatory policy on the spot that no one at Rekall has ever heard of him. This could also explain why Doug has been having vivid, reoccurring dreams of going to Mars and of Mileena before going back to Rekall: a residue of this first failed Ego Trip that Rekall did not manage to properly erase. That's why Mileena's face appears on the screen in front of Doug after he specifies what type of girl he wants in his fantasy, because she is in fact just a Rekall fabrication and he'd picked her the 1st time around, too. Guy knows what he wants. Doug's dream actually begins with his cab ride home, and not with him going beserk. The alien structures featured at the end of the movie also appear on the screen before Doug goes under. Hence them appearing within Doug's Ego Trip fantasy later on. The technician then mentions \"Blue skies on Mars?\" with a very cynical attitude in reference to a newly implemented feature to the Ego Trip storyline. Hence the fantasy ending with a blue sky on Mars. This theory is further supported by Doug's brief conversation about Rekall with his coworker/friend Harry at the quarry. Harry tells Doug not to go to Rekall and states that a \"friend of his\" went there and nearly got himself lobotomized. Nearly. Harry is of course actually talking about Doug, (Harry knows Doug does not \"recall\" the 1st instance) and that's why when Doug disappointingly looks away from Harry and his advice, Harry looks back to Doug with a very worried expression. Worried that his friend will repeat the same mind threatening mistake. Which of course he does (or we wouldn't have a movie after all). Elements of his schizoid embolism are indeed self-implemented from Doug's reality. Such as his friend Harry & wife Lori being a part of it, suddenly trying to kill him. Doug also saw Cohaagan on the news many times before. So, just like a real dream functions, his delusion is a mixing pot of both real life figures and ones from the implant. The rest is just Doug's imagination running rampant as his true persona and made-up persona are at constant odds with one another, resulting in his eventual and inevitable lobotomy, which ultimately transcends his reality. (Which we, in the real real world all know, is also made up.) Poor Doug. Should've listened to Harry. \"Don't fuck with your brain, Pal. It ain't worth it.\"",
            "Assuming that Doug is not spending the majority of the movie dreaming in a chair at Recall, but everything he experiences is really happening, the proposed series of events could be as follows:Vilos Cohaagen is administrator on Mars, Hauser is his trusted friend and employee. During the colonization of Mars, Cohaagen has sacrificed many workers by letting them work to death, and allowing others to mutate into hideous forms, due to poor shielding from space radiation and bad air quality. Cohaagen further extorts Mars' inhabitants with high taxes on air, threatening to shut off the air to those who oppose him. This causes a resistance group of Martians (colonists and mutants) to start terrorist actions against Cohaagen's forces, in order to free Mars from his oppression. During mining operations in the Pyramid mountains, workers discover remnants of an ancient alien civilization. Its purpose was perhaps to make Mars an habitable planet with its own atmosphere; however, that would effectively take away Cohaagen's source of power, so he closes the mine and keeps the finding a secret, maintaining that the alien machinery was there to cause a global meltdown and destroy Mars if it was ever turned on (or he likes to believe that, at least). The resistance leader, Kuato, learns about the secret, and that it may be the key to the salvation of the planet, so he desperately seeks the truth.Several attempts are made to eradicate the resistance, but the rebels are well hidden among the inhabitants of Mars; infiltration missions fail because many of the mutants are psychic and spot the spies eventually before they can find out who and where Kuato is. So Cohaagen and Hauser set up a delicate plan. Hauser starts spying on a woman called Melina, who is suspected of working with the rebels. He gains her trust by convincing her he wants to get out of Cohaagen's organisation. Just when he is ready to be introduced into the resistance, Hauser pulls out and \"disappears\" to make the rebels and Melina think he has been caught and killed by Cohaagen. A trail is set for \"Douglas Quaid\" to find his way into the heart of the resistance. Hauser tapes a video to himself, explaining how he wanted to betray Cohaagen, and that Quaid needs to go to Mars to join the rebels. He also makes another tape, one to be revealed to Quaid after Kuato has been killed, explaining the entire scheme. A suite in the Hilton Hotel on Mars is rented in Houser's name, and a message is left there with instructions to find Melina. Hauser's memory is isolated and blocked, a bug is inserted in his head and he gets the memory and personality of Douglas Quaid, a construction worker on Earth. One of Cohaagen's spies, Lori, goes to live with him pretending she is his wife, making sure that he remembers nothing of his former life. Other people keeping an eye on Quaid are Harry, who impersonates a colleague on his work, and Richter. None of them, however, are told that Hauser is actually a double agent; they simply believe Hauser is a traitor who got punished by having to live out his days on Earth as Quaid.The object is to have Quaid return to Mars after a while so he can get into contact with Melina and the resistance again. Unfortunately, this plan gets accelerated when Quaid unexpectedly begins to have dreams of his former life on Mars as Hauser. He is so fascinated by these dreams that he goes to Rekall to have a trip to Mars implanted. However, during the implantation procedure, the scientists inadvertently reactivate Hauser's memory. They wipe it and restore Quaid's personality again, but Harry, Lori and Richter fear that the procedure at Rekall will cause Hauser to resurface again, so they try to kill him, despite Cohaagen's orders to bring Quaid back alive. Cohaagen has another agent deliver a suitcase to Quaid, containing the first Hauser message, the bug extractor, and enough information to get to the Hilton Hotel on Mars and find the message to look for Melina. On Mars, Benny, another one of Cohaagen's spies, helps Quaid to get where he needs to be. But Melina does not believe Quaid's story and sends him away. Benny relays this information to Cohaagen, who calls in Dr. Edgemar from Rekall to present himself to Quaid as a memory implant, in an attempt to fool Quaid into handing himself over with Lori's help (Edgemar may even be the person who wiped Hauser's mind the first time). It is not quite sure why they want Quaid back now; perhaps they want to reacquire him and try another way to get him to Kuato, now that Melina seems unlikely to be of any help. Despite that Quaid sees through Edgemar's ruse, Richter's men succeed in catching him. He is unexpectedly rescued by Melina, and from there, Quaid fulfills his purpose of meeting Kuato and getting Benny close enough to kill him. Afterwards, Quaid learns from Hauser's message how he has essentially been double-crossed by himself. The big flaw in this plan was obviously that \"Quaid\", the new personality, could not be adequately controlled, and started to defend his own existence, leading to him activating the alien device, and the bad guy becoming the hero.This explanation leaves several coincidences unaccounted for: e.g. Bob from Rekall, Dr. Lull, the Rekall technician and Dr. Edgemar give a lot of examples of what will happen in the implanted dream, which happens in actuality later on. Also, Milena's face is already pre-programmed as an optional mystery woman in the Ego Trip; it is very coincidental that she would really exist. However, they may have alternate explanations: Milena's face may just be standard enough that she closely resembles the standard athletic brunette pre-programmed in the Ego Trip. There is a possibility that programmers from Rekall did some field research on Mars for creating the Ego Trip, heard all the rumours going around about the Pyramid Mountains, the alien machinery, its purpose, and the prophecy of someone saving Mars one day, and decided to make these elements part of the Ego Trip (and thus accidentally predicted the future). They may even have used existing people on Mars as \"templates\" for the people in the Ego Trip (which would explain why Milena is pre-programmed in it). Dr Edgemar is probably one of Cohaagen's trusted employees, and as such, one of the few people who knew exactly what had happened to Doug and what the alien machinery could do. Since Doug is still hesitant to believe him, Edgemar has no choice but to fabricate a story, and make it as convincing as possible, by including his own believes and predictions, hoping the amount of detail will convince Doug that he tells the truth (and initially, it worked).In any which way, it should be noted that in the audio commentary, Verhoeven correctly states that the quality of the script is exemplified by the fact that two characters can accurately predict the direction the story will go in, yet the film retains its edge-of-the-seat feel.",
            "Quaid and Melina make it to the control room. As Quaid prepares to turn on the reactor, he is confronted by Cohaagen who warns him that the reaction will spread to all the tribidium on the planet, putting Mars into a global meltdown. Instead, he intends to blow up the reactor, keeping his control over the air supply. He turns his gun on Quaid, however, Melina shoots Cohaagen first. He activates the bomb anyway, but Quaid tosses it into an exit tunnel. The explosion rips open the walls causing massive decompression from exposure to the atmopsheric vacuum. Quaid and Melina hang on as the decompression tries to suck them outside, but Cohaagen is sucked out onto the surface of the planet where he quickly dies from lack of oxygen. Quaid laboriously crawls his way over to the reactor and activates it before he and Melina are also sucked outside onto the planet's surface. They struggle to breathe as the reaction begins to spread across the planet, causing the release of breathable oxygen and allowing them and all Martian residents to safely breathe the free air. In the final scene, Quaid and Melina stand outside, gazing at the blue sky. Quaid wonders whether it's real, but Melina replies: \"Kiss me quick before you wake up.\""

            "Are Ninny and Idgie Threadgoode the same person?"
        ],
        "answers": [
            "That is untrue. Go back and watch the scene it says 1903 to 1939. This story is based on the authors Aunt, Bess Fortenberry, and her friend and the cafe is actually Irondale Cafe in Irondale, Alabama. There was an article about it in 1994 in the Chicago Tribune but it won't let me post the link.",
            "There has been a lot of speculation among viewers of the film about the final scene, in which it seems apparent that Ninny Threadgoode and Idgie are the same person. When Evelyn couch finds a note and a jar of honey on Ruth's grave, Ninny gives her a \"knowing look\" and Evelyn takes on a look of understanding. However, the final scene is not a definitive statement that they are the same. Evidence throughout the movie shows the separation between the characters, and scenes are listed below:1. Ninny states in the nursing home during her first scene that she was practically adopted by the Threadgoode family, not born directly into it.2. Ninny Threadgoode also states that she married Cleo Threadgoode, another one of Idgie's brothers. However, Cleo Threadgoode never appears by name in the film, and neither does Ninny, so the confusion is understandable.3. During the wedding scene near the beginning, a child-aged Idgie is on her brother Buddy's back while Ninny says in voiceover that she (Ninny) had always had a crush on Buddy, rather than \"Idgie always had a crush on Buddy.\" Even if she was trying to pretend that she and Idgie were separate people, it doesn't seem likely that Idgie would describe herself as having a \"crush\" on her own brother.4. Towards the end of the movie Ninny says that Sipsey confessed on her deathbed the full truth of Frank Bennett's death. Idgie knew the truth from the beginning, so Sipsey would have no reason to confess if Ninny were Idgie.5. Mrs. Otis, Ninny's friend and roommate, was also present at Sipsey's confession, meaning that she would know both Idgie and Ninny if they were separate people. Mrs Otis' adult daughter confirms that her mother has been Ninny's neighbor for many years. Even though we never see Ninny and Mrs Otis interact in the film, it seems likely Mrs Otis would have noticed that her long-time friend \"Idgie\" was suddenly calling herself \"Ninny.\"The implication that Ninny and Idgie are the same person, therefore, is impossible based on several other points in the film.The book makes it clear that Ninny and Idgie are different people, as Ninny has died and Evelyn is visiting her grave when she finds the jar of honey and the note on Ruth's tombstone. A final scene confirms that Idgie now runs a roadside stand with her brother Julian (the boy who made fun of Idgie at the wedding), where they sell honey while Idgie entertains visitors with her tall tales.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The above is one interpretation of the film, whereas below offers another with understanding of creative story adaptation for film. Out of respect for everyone's right to their own opinions, it has been left to offer the reader the option to decide for themselves which version makes more sense to them. This is one sign of the amazing skill of the writers of the movie - over 20 years later, people are STILL trying to figure out the truth of the story. This is an attribute of truly creative storytelling.In the film adaptation of this book, Idgie and Ninny are indeed the same person. Using the points made above, the other interpretation of Idgie and Ninny being the same person is addressed below:1. As far as being adopted, this is a turn of phrase in Idgie's creative storytelling to Evelyn. Idgie keeps Buddy's memory alive by, as the saying goes, spinning a good yarn (which most likely influenced the author's choice of the name \"Threadgoode\"). \"Practically adopted\" is just another way of telling Evelyn that she was part of the Threadgoode family and establishes a close familial connection, which is why she would know so many details of Ruth and Idgie's lives.2. Cleo does not appear in this movie because the theatrical Ninny IS the theatrical Idgie. Ninny is trying to establish a deep connection to the Threadgoode family, otherwise her intimate knowledge does not quite make enough sense. She does not want Evelyn to figure out at the beginning of her tale that she is actually Idgie. Cleo being left out was done to make the idea that Idgie and Ninny are one in the same only slightly more obvious. For all we know, \"Cleo\" is a completely made up name for her husband's real name. In the book Ninny and Idgie are indeed separate, but making them the same person makes the story more intriguing, and confusing, for the 3rd party - the viewer of the movie.3. Ninny says she had such a crush on him because young Idgie loved her brother so much that when he died she never got over it. As Buddy's \"pet since the day she was born,\" she was completely heartbroken. This is a creative way to express her love for Buddy and implies how strong it is as well as keeping Evelyn unaware of Ninny's true connection to Buddy as his little sister. ( You have to understand that what is happening on screen is always directly linked to the narration, and when Ninny said she had \"such a crush\" on Buddy, Buddy is carrying Idgie around on his back and they are the focus of the scene.)4. When Ninny says that Sipsey confessed on her deathbed to herself and Mrs. Otis, this is just another creative way for Ninny to tell Evelyn the story and explains why she knows exactly what happened to Ruth's husband. It's just a creative cover story. Evelyn wouldn't be able to \"fact check\" Ninny's story because she was not there and no one is alive who was (especially after Mrs. Otis dies), so who can argue with Ninny's claim that it was a deathbed confession and not something of which she already had direct knowledge? Evelyn simply trusts that what Ninny is telling her is the truth, but that does not mean that it is actually true. She never second guesses Ninny by going to Mrs. Otis.5. Yes, Mrs. Otis would notice if Idgie suddenly started calling herself Ninny... but only if she was present to hear the story. However she is not. She's never seen interacting with Ninny. One can assume the name \"Ninny\" was completely made up for the story being told to Evelyn and to make the truth and fiction harder to separate. This would be another tribute by Idgie to her brother Buddy. (Another interpretation of the name change is that as soon as Idgie settled down, she became a different person than young Idgie, and so gave herself another name to distinguish her younger, wild, carefree self from her older, settled, married self. In that case, Idgie and Ninny would be the same person to Mrs. Otis anyways.)As you can see, all of the points can be interpreted in another way which confirms that Ninny is in fact Idgie. This was done because an old woman telling a younger woman a story about two other women who lived in the 1930's is not nearly as interesting as one of those women growing old and concealing her identity in order to tell Evelyn the great story of the lives of her two greatest loves - Buddy and Ruth. This is why the scene at the end has Evelyn and Ninny exchanging a look of knowing when Evelyn discovers the note on the the grave, because Evelyn JUST figured out that Ninny IS Idgie. Evelyn continues to play along with Ninny's creative storytelling by asking \"Maybe we'll see her today?\" as she looks at Ninny, who playfully returns \"Maybe.\"What went unnoticed above is that Ruth's tombstone shows \"1903-1989\". That means she died in advanced age, not while Buddy Jr was still a kid. That also means that she died just 1 or 2 years before \"Ninny\" meets Evelyn. So the whole \"cancer while young\" story is bogus. So might be as well the \"marriage with Cleo\" and \"Albert's 30 years of life\" narratives."

The gunshot that is heard is from Lecter shooting Officer Boyle, who was also guarding him, in the stomach. Lecter did not shoot Pembry, but he did break his neck and mutilate his face.",
            "Her suspicions are aroused when \"Gordon\" asks if Frederika Bimmell was \"a great big fat person.\" Lecter pointed out that all of the victims were larger women, because the killer wants their skins to fit onto a man's body. That Gumb's first thought of a woman he didn't otherwise recognize was her size was enough to make Starling want to find out more. Once inside his house, Clarice recognizes the Death's Head (moth) in the living room. Gumb gives his name as \"Jack Gordon.\" Those initials, J.G., are consistent with \"Jame Gumb\" and \"John Grant,\" both aliases named by Crawford.",
            "From Lecter's advice-that Bill covets that which he sees every day-Clarice and Ardelia deduce that the first victim could have been someone who Bill knew personally. Clarice drives to Belvedere, Ohio to talk with the father of the first victim, Frederika Bimmel. In looking over Frederika's bedroom, Clarice finds a music box ballerina, in which she finds a false bottom that contains pictures obviously missed during previous investigations. On the pictures, Frederika is seen posing, wearing only underwear, suggesting that there was indeed an unknown man in her life who took the pictures, most likely her murderer. Clarice goes through a wardrobe and notices the triangular gussets on Frederika's dresses match the pieces of skin Bill cut from one of his victims. Clarice calls Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) to inform him that Bill is making a \"woman suit\" of real skin. Crawford is already in route to Chicago, having identified Bill as Jame Gumb, but they find that the house where he's supposedly living has been abandoned. Clarice continues to poke around in Belvedere and interviews one of Frederika's friends, who points to the house of \"old Mrs Littman\" where she was often hanging around. Mrs Littman doesn't live there any more, but the current resident, who calls himself Jack Gordon, offers to give her Mrs Littman's son's business card and invites Clarice inside to wait. When she notices spools of thread and a Death's-Head moth, she realizes that Jack Gordon is really Jame \"Buffalo Bill\" Gumb. She pulls her gun on him, but Gumb leads her on a wild goose chase into the basement, where he has Catherine Martin imprisoned in a well. Gumb dons a night vision mask and turns out the lights, leaving Clarice to feel around in the dark. When he makes the mistake of cocking his gun, Clarice shoots him. Catherine is subsequently rescued. In the final scenes, Clarice is shown graduating from the Academy. At the party that follows, she receives a phone call from Lecter, calling from the airport on the island of Bimini in the Bahamas. He assures her that he's not about to come looking for her and requests that she extend him the same courtesy, which Clarice cannot do, of course. He then says that he must hang up because he's \"having an old friend for dinner\", as he watches Dr. Frederick Chilton deplane.",
            "The closing, where Hannibal says: \"I'm having an old friend for dinner\" as he watches Dr. Chilton deplane, strongly suggests that Chilton ended up as one of Hannibal's meals. A small reference was made in the sequel novel Hannibal, where it was mentioned that Chilton disappeared seven years earlier while on vacation, strongly suggesting Hannibal had gotten his revenge (albeit in the novel, Chilton disappeared in Jamaica, not the Bahamas). However, this is never specifically stated in the sequel movie.

            "While it seems that Director Paul Verhoeven never needs an excuse for more sex and nudity, there are at least two reasons. One is that it's meant to show some of the inner demons Nick is still dealing with along with the effects of working so much on this sordid murder case.The second possible reason is popular with some fans of the movie, as the scene may help the viewer determine who is or isn't the real killer. At the beginning when the murder takes place, the audience doesn't see the killer's face but they do see her body. Later on we get several chances to see Catherine Tramell's body. It could be that be seeing Dr. Garner naked it may be possible to determine who the real killer is. It's unlikely Tramell would have agreed to a consensual sexual encounter due to professional ethics, so it may have been necessary to come up with any way to get her undressed, and given the state of affairs in the movie, a rape scene wasn't out of the question.",
            "The last scene leaves implicit that Catherine is the real killer and framed Beth, who was innocent. Nick knows and even so decides to stay with her.",
            "This only a theory: Catherine sent Beth a message as Gus to Beth via a note (Which she may had forged Gus's handwriting) telling Beth to meet him at the office building thinking Catherine's college roommate wanted to meet them and Catherine may had also sent a message to Gus as Beth telling him to meet her there. After killing Gus, quickly fleeing the scene and disposing of the blood stained hoodie she wore when she killed Gus, Catherine somehow broke into Beth's apartment and planted the photos and newspaper clippings of Catherine and Boz and disposed of evidence that Catherine was in Beth's apartment and Catherine. In the time between Nick and the police were at Beth's apartment, Catherine returned to her place and changed clothes and cleaned the ice pick and broke into Nick's apartment and planted the ice pick under his bed so she could kill him and she waited as long as she could for Nick and as she Nick approaching his apartment, started fake crying. Why Catherine didn't get the ice pick and kill Nick and why she changed her mind? There is one possibility: Nick knew that in the ending of Catherine's novel, the detective dies and with Catherine not killing Nick, Nick would still believe Catherine is innocent.",

He reads a few lines that describe how Shooter finds his partner dead, his feet sticking out of the elevator door. Later, while Nick waits in the car as Gus go to talk with the person who called Gus with information about Catherine Tramell and Lisa Hoberman, Nick realizes that Gus must take the elevator up to the meeting place in Suite 405. He suddenly realizes that Gus has been set up to die just as it was written in Catherine's manuscript.",

In a distraught manner, Catherine begins to babble about how she can't allow herself to care about anyone and how she doesn't want to do 'this' and lose Nick. They end up making love, Catherine collapsing into Nick's arms afterwards. Catherine asks Nick what they do now, and he replies: 'Fuck like minks, raise rugrats, and live happily ever after.' As Catherine's hand slowly slides down the side of the bed, she admits that she hates 'rug rats', so Nick says, 'Forget the rug rats.' She slowly, almost menacingly, turns toward him, then suddenly grabs him with both arms and kisses him torridly.

            "No. Penguin originally wanted to be welcomed by the people of Gotham. Penguin extorted Max Schreck to do it. Which involved a complicated scheme of trying to make the Penguin look heroic and villifying Batman. While also having Penguin run for Mayor. During this time, Penguin tries to find his birth parents in the hall of records. Once Batman foils the plan and Penguin is once again met with hatred and revulsion by Gotham, Schreck immediately abandons him and Penguin resorts to taking revenge on the people of Gotham by kidnapping the first born of every wealthy family in Gotham, which also included Max's son, Chip. So clearly Max was not in on this plan.",
            "No one has answered this question yet.",
            "Not until the very end of the film. Shreck sees Bruce Wayne only as a possible investor in his power plant, and Penguin doesn't interact much at all with Bruce, so neither of them connect him with Batman. Catwoman sees Bruce Wayne as a rich, eligible bachelor for whom she has romantic feelings. She doesn't learn that he is Batman until Schreck's party when Bruce says back to her word-for-word an exchange they had when in their guises as Batman and Catwoman: \"Mistletoe can be deadly if you eat it. A kiss can be even deadlier if you mean it.\"",
            "Yes. Selina Kyle was working as a meek secretary for Max Shreck and living alone with only her cat for company. When she discovered Max's real plan for a power plant he was intending to build, he pushed her out of a window to keep her quiet. She survived the fall but her personality changed, becoming more aggressive and vindictive. She cut up a leather coat, fashioned for herself a cat costume, donned a bullwhip, and Catwoman was born.Second Opinion: Actually, it's shown, but never actually explained. She falls out the window, lands, and before she awakens, a group of cats bite her fingers, which seems to bring her back to life. There is no explanation if the cats brought her to life or if she simply didn't die... but the actual reason is never actually explained in this movie i.e. unlike Jack Napier falling into the vat showed exactly how he transformed from a mobster into The Joker.",
            "Yes. The movie opens with a scene showing how Esther Cobblepot (Diane Salinger) gave birth to Oswald, who was born deformed with Penguin-like features. They keep him locked in a cage and after seeing him kill their cat, they decided to throw the infant Oswald into a river. Oswald then drifts down the river, into the sewer and is brought ashore and raised by penguins. Thirty-three years later, Oswald is shown as a deformed man with flippers for fingers and still living in the sewer with a flock of penguins under the Gotham Zoo's Arctic World.",
            "Batman follows Penguin into his sewer lair under Arctic World where Catwoman has Shreck cornered. He stops her from killing Shreck and suggests that they take him to the police, after which they can go home together. Even though Shreck is watching, Batman pulls off his mask, revealing his identity as Bruce Wayne. Catwoman almost agrees but suddenly refuses on grounds that she couldn't live with herself. She pulls off her mask, too, revealing to Shreck her identity as Selina Kyle. Shreck immediately fires her, shoots Bruce, and turns the gun on Selina. She challenges him, saying, \"You killed me, the Penguin killed me, and Batman killed me. That's three lives. You got enough (bullets) in there to finish me off?\" Shreck fires and keeps firing four times until he is out of bullets, but Selina keeps advancing. Figuring she still has two lives left, she uses one of them to electrocute him with power cables and a taser, causing the lair to burst with explosions. She then disappears. Penguin suddenly rises out of the toxic water, bleeding from his mouth. He complains that the heat is getting to him and that he needs a drink of ice water but collapses and dies, his penguins sliding him into his watery grave. Later, as Bruce and Alfred are driving down the street, Bruce notices what looks like Catwoman's shadow against a wall. He jumps out of the car but she is nowhere to be seen. In the final scene, the bat signal emblazons the night sky, and Catwoman's head looks up at it, suggesting that she still has one life left.",
            "In the special features section of various DVD releases, it is mentioned that the final shot showing that Catwoman had survived was added at the last minute at the studio's insistence. The film was originally to have ended more ambiguously. Following Batman Returns, there were plans to have Catwoman subsequently featured in a film of her own, but the project was stuck in \"development hell\" for a whole decade. By the time Catwoman (2004) was finally made in 2004, all of the originally-slated participants had dropped out or been let go, and the character was no longer even Selina Kyle or related to the Batman universe. The most likely in-universe answer is that not seeing Catwoman in any of the Batman sequels could simply mean that Selina Kyle has given up her life of crime or simply moved away from Gotham City. However, there were ideas for Michelle Pfeiffer to return as Catwoman in Batman Forever (1995)."

        "answers": [
            "Presumably because ordering the Code Red was a criminal act and the judge was reminding Jessup that he had the Fifth Amendment right to not incriminate himself. The Bill of Rights generally applies to military courts-martial, though sometimes differently than in civilian courts. But the right against self-incrimination is fundamental enough that it undoubtedly applies, or at least Sorkin might well have thought it does.It could also have had something to do with the fact that when Kaffee was yelling at Jessep the Judge told Kaffee he was now in contempt of court, due to Kaffee's suddenly hostile attitude toward Jessep, a high ranking Marine officer and toward the court. In the end, Kaffee could be arrested and even tried for his contempt. Thus due to the judge's decision he says he doesn't have answer since Kaffee is in contempt of court and thus the line of questioning is over. Those charges would likely be dismissed by the judge and wouldn't count against him due to Jessep's willingness to answer and basically incriminate himself.",
            "It was likely because Colonel Jessep was willing to answer the question and admitted to ordering the code red. Thus it now makes sense to the court as to why Kaffee was so pushing and demanding with his questioning. Therefore the Judge likely ordered the Contempt of Court to be stricken from the record and allow Kaffee to not only go free, but finish the trial. Also, Capt Ross is a prosecutor. Both as a JAG prosecutor and as Kaffe's superior, Capt Ross can levee charges against Kaffe, but doesn't have arrest authority.",
            "Markinson had gone through classified training in intelligence and had years of experience working in the field. Most of what he'd learned about subterfuge probably came to him from working in the field for that long. We don't really know how much time lapsed from when Markinson disappeared until he slipped into Kaffee's car but it seems like a good amount of time to observe Kaffee in Washington and learn his habits, like how often he visits Luther's newsstand. He also could have simply found out Kaffee's address or where his office at JAG was and followed him from there.The only real way to know the answer is to join the Marine Corps and qualify then go into the intelligence field into one of the MOSs that require that training.",
            "From a writing perspective they needed a character in the room who didn't know what that meant so there was a logical reason why someone else in the room would explain it to the audience. However within the context of the film, Downey wasn't portrayed as being especially smart so I guess it's within his character to not know what a dishonorable discharge was.Although it seems more likely that he did know that getting a dishonorable discharge was devastating. How would he know that? A couple reasons come to mind. First, he was there (before Kaffee asked Commander Galloway if he could speak to his client privately) when Corporal Dawson asked Lt. Kaffee if they took the plea deal, would they get a dishonorable discharge, and Kaffee says \"probably.\" Dawson's reaction to that answer illustrated that he was vehemently opposed to taking a deal if it meant sacrificing his honor. Again, Private Downey was in the room when that exchange between Dawson and Kaffee took place, so he would have known that, at the very least, A dishonorable discharge was very bad. Second, Downey's reaction to getting a dishonorable discharge also indicates he knew it was devastating. So, it would seem that his outburst/question, \"What does that mean? What did we do wrong? We did nothing wrong,\" was related to him not knowing WHY they received that punishment, and not because he didn't know what the punishment (dishonorable discharge) was.",
            "As stated in the movie, Kaffee would have very easily been reprimanded for his conduct at minimum, such as facing the court marshal he joked about facing when he was having his drunken meltdown.However, because of the reveal during Jessup's testimony and the fact it is a movie, this is forgotten about pretty quickly.",
            "No one has answered this question yet.",
            "The film never tells us however given how desperately Santiago wanted to get out of Gitmo (giving him a reason to lie about the shooting), and how dedicated Dawson was to his honor (lying would be out of character for him), it's more likely that Dawson firing at the enemy was indeed justified and Santiago either lied or mistakenly concluded that the enemy never engaged Dawson.",
            "In many cases, when someone accepts a plea agreement, one of the stipulations is forfeiting the right to appeal. Since Dawson and Downey rejected the plea offered by the prosecutor, they would be able to appeal the one charge they were convicted of (conduct unbecoming of a US Marine).",
            "Lt. Col. Markinson (J.T. Walsh) clearly felt tremendous guilt over Santiago's death and blamed himself because he wasn't able to stop Jessup from ordering the Code Red. Doing the right thing (telling Kaffee the truth), however, has put him in a position where he could lose everything: his job, his rank, his respect among his peers, and, most importantly, his honor and we can bet that Jessup would've done everything he could to destroy Markinson's career, despite them being good friends for many years. Unable to do the right thing without destroying his own life and consumed with guilt over the murder, Markinson sees no way to go other than to shoot himself."

            "Moss tries repeatedly to convince Aaranow to break in to the office and steal the good leads. Moss would then sell them to a rival sales company and split the profits with Aaronow. We never see Aaronow agree to this. The next day, the office is broken in to. At the end we find out Levene was the one who broke in and stole the leads, and when pressed to find out who his accomplice was, he says it was Moss.So while we see the conversation between Moss and Aaranow, it's likely that Moss went to Levene first and had the same conversation with him. We see Levene on the phone with the hospital about his daughter. We hear him say \"They cancelled her..... I'll have the money tomorrow.\". It's likely Levene originally refused Moss, so Moss went to Aaranow. But motivated by desperation, Levene ended up stealing the leads and bringing them to Moss to fence.",
            "No. Williamson tells Levene that \"I'm trying to get home for two hours. I gotta go home, grab one hour with my kids, come back, see if any of you closed a contract, take the contract to the bank.\" Obviously, Williamson went home for an hour, and then returned to the office after Roma had closed the Lingk deal but before Levene had broken in. Presumably, Roma left the closed Lingk contract in a drop box or some other form of receptacle on his desk.",
            "The break-in and robbery of the office is never shown on camera, so as a result, no definitive answer is provided for this question in the film, and fans have thus hypothesized several theories as to the significance of the phones being stolen.The most popular suggestion is simply that stealing the phones was Levene's way of making the robbery look like more of a regular office burglary; if he had only stolen the leads and nothing else, it would have been immediately obvious that the break-in was not a random burglary, but one orchestrated for the express purpose of getting the leads, hence it must have been carried out by someone who knew about them, i.e. it must have been an inside job. As we see, Roma was annoyed that he had to reconfirm all of his deals for the last couple days. But due to the fact he had no phone to simply call them, he'd have to either go find a payphone or knock on their doors.Another theory is that Levene took the phones to prevent Roma, Moss and Aaronow from being able to make sales calls that morning, thus giving himself an extra edge in the sales contest.It would also serve to create more of a hassle for Williamson while he was trying to re-establish order in the office. It would keep him from calling his superiors at Mitch & Murray to provide them with updates on how things were going and to keep M&M from calling Williamson with advice and/or orders on how to handle the situation.",
            "Some fans find the penultimate scene in the film a little confusing as to why Roma loses his temper so much with Williamson; what exactly does Williamson do that merits such an outburst?The problem concerns how long Lingk has to pull out of the deal, the oft-mentioned \"three days.\" If Lingk thinks the cheque has been cashed, he will think he only has until Friday to back out of the deal, and will thus act immediately. Roma is trying to convince him he has until Monday, telling him the cheque hasn't been cashed yet (the scene takes place on Wednesday morning). Roma's reason for doing this is if they wait until Monday, Lingk will no longer be able to pull out of the deal, as he says himself, the time will have elapsed. If Roma can make Lingk believe that the cheque has not been cashed, Lingk might agree to wait until Monday, hence making a renege on the deal impossible, but if Lingk thinks the cheque has been cashed, he obviously isn't going to wait, and will attempt to pull out of the deal immediately. Williamson ruins Roma's plan by telling Lingk that the cheque has already been cashed (which it hasn't), thus Lingk assumes he only has until Friday, and Roma will now be unable to convince him to wait until Monday; hence Lingk will be able to back out of the deal, as he will do so in the time allowed. Williamson mistakenly thinks Lingk is worried about the deal going through, that the contract may have been stolen in the robbery, so he lies about it, saying the contract has already gone to the bank (which it hasn't; it is still on Williamson's desk). He thinks this will help Roma by putting Lingk's mind at ease, when it actual fact it has completely the opposite effect.",
            "Because Levene knew that Williamson was lying about the Lingk contract having gone to the bank. In reality, the Lingk contract was on Williamson's desk, but Williamson tells Roma that he had brought it to the bank. When telling Williamson what an idiot he is, Levene says \"If you're gonna make something up, John, be sure that it helps.\" Levene should have had no way of knowing that Williamson was lying on the spur of the moment. Like Roma, Levene should have assumed that Williamson was telling the truth. As Williamson explains a little later in the film, he usually dropped the contracts off every night, but on the night of the robbery he didn't. So Williamson's spur-of-the-moment lie to Lingk about the contract being sent in should have gone by unrecognized by everyone. But Levene knew because he had seen the contract on the desk. Ergo, he had been in the office and he was the thief.",
            "Shelley's big \"victory\" is the deal he'd made with the Nyborgs for a sale of $82,000, his first big closing in a long time, perhaps years. The Nyborgs had been known around the office (and perhaps other real estate offices) as customers who'd repeatedly show up in the stacks of leads but would never actually take any deals with the salespeople they'd talk to. Shelley, however, didn't know that fact.After Williamson drags Shelley's confession of the crime out of him, he reveals that the check the Nyborgs wrote to close the deal is worthless: the Nyborgs don't have the kind of money Shelley got them to sign for. When Williamson tells Shelley that the Nyborgs are crazy and that he'd had dealings with them at another company, he also tells Shelley \"they just like talking to salesmen,\" which likely means they like to deliberately waste the time of salespeople for their own amusement or due to some mental imbalance. Williamson also points out that if Shelley had been more observant in the Nyborgs' home, he'd have seen that they live rather poorly and couldn't possibly invest in expensive property.In an earlier scene, Moss and Aaronow are talking in the bar at the Chinese restaurant and one of them says the same line. It's likely that the line \"they just like talking to salesmen\" is slang (or even mantra) in the industry for people like the Nyborgs who are crazy enough to listen to a sales pitch just to waste a salesperson's time. The look of despair on Shelley's face when Williamson tells him makes it plain that it's a concept he's very familiar with and that he's been duped after many successful years in the business and the recent slump he's been in.",
            "Many fans have queried this. At the end of the film, Williamson takes great pleasure in telling Levene that the Nyborgs are crazy and that the cheque they wrote for Levene is no good. However, if Williamson knew this, why did he give Levene the lead in the first place? Here is the conversation between the two about the lead:Williamson: \"Bruce and Harriet Nyborg? You wanna see the memos? They're nuts. They used to call in every week when I was with Webb and we were selling Arizona. They're nuts. Did you see how they were living? How can you delude yourself?\"Levene: \"I got their cheque.\"W: \"Yeah, well forget it, frame it, it's worthless.\"L: \"The cheque is no good?\"W: \"Yeah, you wanna wait around, I'll pull the memo. I'm busy now.\"L: \"Wait a minute. The cheque is no good? They're nuts?\"W: \"Wanna call the bank Shelley? I called them. I called them four months ago when we first got the lead. The people are insane. They just like talking to salesmen.\"L: \"Don't...\"W: \"I'm sorry.\"L: \"Why?\"W: \"Because I don't like you.\"L: \"My daughter...\"W: \"Fuck you.\"Williamson knew the Nyborg lead was worthless; as he says, he confirmed it four months previously when Premier Properties first got the lead, but he repeatedly gave the lead to Levene anyway (Levene mentions at one stage that he has seen the Nyborg name several times before). We know Williamson is more than capable of lying as he lies to Lingk about the contract, and then lies to Levene about not turning him in if he confessed. He is also willing to accept a bribe from Levene earlier in the film and to hand out the Glengarry leads. As such, Williamson is portrayed as a man with dubious scruples. Taking this fact together with his comment to Levene \"because I don't like you,\" may imply that Williamson purposefully gave Levene the bad lead simply because he disliked him, to waste his time, cause him to fail and therefore, to bring about his redundancy.Another, similar, theory, is that the parent company, Mitch and Murray, wanted to cut the number of workers they employed so they devised the sales contest and randomly distributed worthless leads to ensure someone would fail (the main difference between this theory and the above is that in the above theory, Levene is specifically chosen to receive the bad lead, but here, he is simply unlucky).Both these theories involve someone at some stage consciously making the decision to give the bad lead to someone, and as such, there can be little doubt that there is some degree of maliciousness at play somewhere along the chain of command; someone knows the lead is bad, but they never make any attempt to recall it."

When asked if Hawkeye was telling the truth about the murdered settlers, he lied, saying that it had to be simply natives raiding the farms. Hawkeye knew the truth: the French and Huron were working together to massacre local settlers as a terror tactic to aid the French and threaten the British.Munro himself was denying a provision of an agreement that his superior, General Webb, came to with the settlers of the area to allow them to leave whatever battle they were assisting in and go home to defend their families in the area. Munro said he needed them at the fort and ordered them all to stay or be charged with abandonment of their duty.When Heywood, Cora and Alice are brought before the Sachem (the village's chief or wisest man) of the Huron village, Cora is to be burned alive to fulfill Magua's wish that Munro's family be wiped out. Hawkeye, who didn't speak French like Heywood, Magua and the Sachem did, offered himself in Cora's place. When Heywood offered himself, he was trying to redeem himself for expressing his jealously toward Cora falling in love with Hawkeye and for not providing proper testimony to support Hawkeye's report about the murdered settlers. The Sachem is convinced enough and agrees.",
            "\"Sachem\" is a general term for any Native American chief. Magua had gone to the Huron village to talk to this man and gain his acceptance as a Huron warrior. As Magua, a Huron, explains, his village had been raided years earlier and destroyed and his children were killed by the British, aided by the Mohawk people. They also took Magua captive and forced him into a life of slavery until he was able to free himself. After personally killing his and the Huron's enemy, Col. Munro and capturing his daughters, he believed it would be enough to regain his status as a Huron warrior. The tradition seems to be that any Huron sachem can grant this request."

            "After the Robbery occurs, the getaway driver Mr. Brown, dies from a gunshot wound to the head, forcing Mr. Orange and Mr. White to flee on foot. They then stop a car with the intent to hijack it. The lady driving the car grabs a gun from her glove compartment and shoots Orange in his abdomen, causing Orange to return fire, killing her.While one may think it is Murder since Orange was participating in the carjacking with White, and that the lady was defending her property, especially since they were armed. In court it would most likely play out in favor of Orange (Freddy). The lady obviously did not know Orange was a undercover cop, and Orange could not divulge that to her, since White was there with him. Some may think that he should have not carjacked the lady, and taken White into custody since the Police were obviously not far away at all, and could have backed him up. He was specifically instructed not to blow his cover until they took Joe Cabot into Custody, since Orange even tells Marvin Nash that the cops were not to move in on the warehouse until Joe showed up. Also it is highly unlikely that Orange had is credentials on him, since he was undercover, and having his credentials could increase the likeliness of his cover getting blown.Another thing someone could say is that undercover cops cannot kill while working undercover. Usually they must talk their way out of it, or pull out of the operation. This is true, however this mostly pertains to if a criminal ordered that person to kill someone to prove your not a cop, or to offer membership as that would be murder. In the instance of Orange and the lady, while she was defending her property (again not knowing Orange was a cop) Orange has also been trained to use deadly force against someone who threatens him with a deadly weapon, thus not only being threatened, but attacked, his natural response is to respond with deadly force. In which he does. If Orange had survived the events, a court case would be opened, and because of the situation he most likely would have been able to prove self defense, as he feared for his life after being shot, as she could have shot him again, or injured White, who they needed alive. So no it was not murder since Orange was threatened with deadly force, he had no other way to respond.",
            "Alive, possibly. Able to move or even be conscious, highly unlikely.According to Amazon's X-Ray feature, a medical expert was on set to ensure the loss of blood shown was not in excess of what a person could lose and still be clinging to life. The assumption would be that this expert would know how much a person could lose and still be (if only barely) functional.",
            "As Joe says \"He was the only one I wasn't 100% on. I should have my fuckin' head examined for going ahead when I wasn't 100%.\"In other words, all the other thieves Joe hired for the job had checked out and were trustworthy. We know that Joe and Eddie had a strong history with Mr. Blonde and Mr. White. Mr. Pink mentions he's known Joe since he was a kid. Which means Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue were likely trusted associates that have worked with Joe before.But Mr. Orange was the new guy. He had never worked with anyone on the team before, and his referral was from a guy named Long Beach Mike who confirmed that Mr. Orange was a good thief. This referral seemed to be enough for Joe to give Orange the job. Once it was obvious that someone set them up to be arrested, Joe immediately deduced it was the new guy on the team. Also, there may have been other hints that Joe initially dismissed, but remembered after the job went south. Think of the opening scene, when Joe asked who didn't throw in for the tip, Orange immediately tells him it's Mr. Pink who doesn't tip, because he doesn't believe in it. If Mr. Orange had any more slip ups like this during his time with the crew, Joe would likely remember it.",
            "Early on, Mr. White whispers to the wounded Mr. Orange, then combs Orange's hair. Mr. Orange laughs. White says, \"It's all right, pal. It's all right,\".",
            "There has been some confusion among viewers as to how Mr. Brown is killed. Because Brown is the getaway driver, and we see him crash the car before we see him injured, some viewers come to think that he has been injured in the crash. Others theorize that he is killed by Mr. Orange, to whom he is talking just before his death. In actuality, as Mr. White tells Mr. Pink, Brown was shot by the police (possibly the officers that Mr. White later fires on). He crashes the car as a result of his soon-to-be-fatal injury. Mr. Orange does not harm Mr. Brown - his shell-shocked behavior after Brown's death is due to the violence that he is witnessing and not yet any that he has committed. He has, after all, just seen his friend Mr. White gun down two of his fellow officers.",
            "Just because someone is shot in the head doesn't mean they die instantly, or at all for that matter. The bullet entered his forehead but may have not gone deep enough to be instantly fatal. It's likely that the wound caused Brown to die from cerebral hemorrhaging, which takes longer, rather than dying from brain tissue trauma.",
            "A famous source of confusion for viewers of Reservoir Dogs is how, in the climactic Mexican stand-off, Nice Guy Eddie is killed. The bullets were supposed to fly thusly: Joe shoots Mr. Orange, Eddie shoots Mr. White, and Mr. White shoots Joe and then Eddie. However, during filming Eddie (Chris Penn)'s squib went off before Mr. White was able to get to him, and he fell to the floor anyway. Hence, the confusion began. Tarantino has claimed that he realized the mistake, but left it in the film to give people something to talk about. Seeing as how Mr. Orange did not have a loaded gun at that time, Mr. White is really the only possible candidate for Eddie's shooting and if you watch the scene in slow motion, as Mr. White is falling, he clearly turns and fires at Eddie. A far-fetched theory is that Mr. Pink, hiding underneath the ramp shot Eddie, so Pink would be the last man standing and get away with the diamonds, though he seemed to want to stay out of it completely.",
            "On the commentary track for the 2002 10th Anniversary Edition DVD of Reservoir Dogs, Quentin Tarantino insists that viewers who don't understand why Mr. Orange tells Mr. White that he is an undercover cop (knowing full well that Mr. White is likely to kill him upon finding out) have not understood the film. Mr. Orange tells Mr. White, who has acted as his protector throughout the film, the truth because he feels that he owes it to him as a matter of honor. Tarantino actually described it as something beyond honor, best summed up by the Japanese word \"jingi\" that has no English equivalent. Having witnessed White sacrifice everything for him; White kills two very good friends of his to protect Orange, taking a bullet and willing to stay behind and lose out on the diamonds and go to prison rather than leave Orange for dead, Orange feels compelled to do likewise.\nOrange does not reveal the truth until the final moment because it is only then that he is free to do so without forsaking his duty as a police officer. Now that Joe Cabot - the man he was sent in to get - is dead, Orange's mission is over.",
            "Following the Mexican stand-off, Joe and Nice Guy Eddie have been killed. Mr. Pink, who stayed out of the fray, leaves with the diamonds. He may be arrested upon leaving the warehouse by the police officers who have just arrived (shouting can be heard following Pink's exit, followed by shots). Before the police enter the warehouse, a shot and bleeding Mr. White cradles Mr. Orange, who reveals that he is really a police officer. Mr. Orange repeats again and again that he is sorry. A devastated Mr. White puts his gun to Orange's head. The police burst in and are heard off-camera urging Mr. White to put his gun down. As the camera remains tight on White's face, we hear him shoot Orange. The police officers react by firing on White, who is knocked back, out of the frame. The credits roll.",
            "Mr. Blue: Killed by the police off-camera. He is never seen again after the opening scene and the \"name assigning\" scene. It is mentioned by Joe that he is \"dead as Dillinger.\" The video game based on the movie reveals he was cornered and shot by the cops in a movie theater, but this may not be canon.Mr. Brown: Shot in the head while driving the getaway vehicle. He crashes, tries to get the car free (the bumpers were locked up in the crash), then dies.Mr. Blonde: While torturing Marvin Nash, Blonde decides to burn him alive, at this point Mr. Orange awakens and unloads his gun into Mr. Blonde.Officer Marvin Nash: Upon finding the bullet-riddled body of Mr. Blonde, Eddie's very good friend; An enraged Eddie shoots Marvin 3 times in the chest, killing him.Joe Cabot: Shot by Mr. White in the Mexican stand-off at the end.Nice Guy Eddie/Eddie Cabot: Also shot by Mr. White in the Mexican stand off. (Though this is debated, the logical answer within the film is that Mr. White turned and shot him as he fell over. Watching the sequence in slow motion also shows this.)Mr. Orange: Shot in the gut during the original getaway by the woman who's car he and Larry stole, bleeding out and unconscious through most of the scenes after the robbery, he comes to and is shot again by Joe in the Mexican stand-off because he suspected Orange of being a cop/rat. Though he doesn't die from this injury, a wounded Mr. White cradles his friend, Mr. Orange, in his arms, trying to console him, hearing the sirens outside. Mr. Orange revealed that he was actually a cop and says he is sorry. Mr. White, realizing that he just killed two of his best friends to protect a new friend who was in fact a cop, is overcome with emotion, pulls out his gun, places it against Mr. Orange's head and pulls the trigger.Mr. White: He is first shot by Eddie in the Mexican stand-off, and the police storm the warehouse just in time to see Mr. White putting the gun against Mr. Orange's head. They order him repeatedly to drop the gun, but he shoots Mr. Orange and in turn is gunned down by the police.Mr. Pink: The only person to survive the ordeal. He tries to reason with the others during the Mexican stand-off but after realizing that nobody is listening to him, he hides underneath the ramp until the shooting stops. He then crawls out, grabs the diamonds and leaves. If you listen closely to the background you can hire sirens, cars crashing and gunfire. This leads people to believe he was killed; however, there is dialogue afterward where you hear police yelling at him to get out of the car, and Mr. Pink can be heard saying, \"Don't shoot me; I've been shot, goddamn it!\", and then the police yell, \"Are you a cop killer? Did you kill a cop?\" Seconds later they break into the warehouse to find Mr. White and Mr. Orange. In the videogame, depending on how many people you kill, Mr. Pink can: (1) die, (2) get arrested, or (3) get away without the diamonds (although he did put two handfuls in his pockets)."

            "There are many theories as to the presence of the ring and its meaning. One of the most popular is that it allows for the bearer to teleport through space and time. This explains why Agent Jeffries appears and then vanishes from the FBI office, why Chet Desmond vanishes after taking it, why Cooper is able to communicate with Laura in the Black Lodge and how Annie is able to tell Laura about Cooper being stranded in the lodge.Another theory is that the ring protects the wearer from being inhabited by Bob's spirit.There is also the possibility that the ring is a physical reference to the events of Twin Peaks being caught in a circle, or ring, and destined to repeat themselves. Also of note, the symbol on the ring is the same symbol seen in one episode of the TV series on a Native American cave painting. This may be connected to the fact that Dale Cooper is trapped in the Black Lodge, where events are non-linear.This is actually suggested in the final episode of the TV series, where a scene between Bobby and Shelly at the Double-R Diner plays out exactly the same as a scene in the pilot. Another reference to this idea comes from a line of dialogue spoken by the Man From Another Place, cut from the film's convenience store scene: \"And everything will proceed cyclically.\"The 2017 series Twin Peaks: The Return showed the ring as being a conduit to the Black Lodge. Anyone who died while wearing the ring would appear subsequently in the lodge, returning the ring to its home.",
            "The drug dealer Bobby kills is, in fact, the Deer Meadow Police Deputy that had a run-in with FBI Agent Chet Desmond earlier in the film. The murder is only briefly referenced in the pilot, when James is telling Donna of his last night with Laura. There is no further explicit reference made to the event in the series, although curiously in one episode Bobby is seen briefly reaching out seemingly in desperation to a crucifix on a wall before being disturbed. It could also be inferred that Bobby's difficult relationship with his father Major Briggs during the series may have something to do with Bobby's angst over the killing, to which he cannot bring himself to confess."

When Qualen regains visibility, he flies the copter at Gabe, who escapes by jumping over the side of the cliff and hanging on to the ladder. Qualen pulls the ladder away from the mountainside, but it remains tethered at the bottom, causing the chopper to crash upside down into the side of the cliff. Gabe loses his hold on the ladder and falls off, landing on the bottom of the dangling copter. Qualen climbs out and attacks Gabe. Suddenly, the ladder gives way, Gabe grabs the side of the cliff, and the helicopter falls to the ground below, sending Qualen to his death.

            "At that time Kimble is a convicted murderer and a fugitive. Given specific circumstances, it would be legal to use lethal force, as Gerard did with Copeland.",
            "Gerard's first red flag was when Cosmo asked him why Kimble would work at a hospital that's crawling with cops, when an amputee walked by. After following him to the prosthetic ward, he asked to see a list of patients that have a criminal record, and (correctly) assumed Kimble would visit him in county lockup. After unsuccessfully chasing him in the police headquarters and through the parade, Gerard's team watched the surveillance video of the visit and saw that it was a quick visit. They then talked to the initial Chicago police who gave a lazy theory about they money. Gerard concluded that Kimble was innocent after the break-in at Sykes's home, when he became agitated during the interview, and later saw his employer's connection to Kimble.",
            "No. While it's possible that the blow Kimble delivered to Nichols could be fatal, Gerard does not check Nichols for a pulse or show any concern that he may be fatally wounded.The screenplay describes Nichols as \"unconscious,\" and has direction saying that Nichols was carried out on a stretcher, and loaded into an ambulance.",
            "The shots of Kimble and Gerard in the tunnel overlooking the dam were filmed on a special set built on a flatbed truck. The truck was parked on top of the dam, and the tunnel end was rotated out over the edge. Harrison Ford actually looked out over the dam while wearing a safety harness.For the jump, several custom-built dummies were filmed being thrown out of the tunnel and falling over the dam. These reportedly cost $12,000 each.",
            "No. Although Helen does say \"Richard\" during the 9-1-1 call, she was actually calling out to her husband to help her, perhaps having heard him just entering the house. Some have suggested that the One-Armed Man, Frederick Sykes (Andreas Katsulas), allowed her to make the call and may even have forced her to say Richard's name. Still, it's easy to see how the courts would think differently from the call.",
            "Because it's true. Gerard's job is to catch fugitives, not to figure out their guilt or innocence. That's for the courts. He doesn't care that Kimble is innocent or not, he just needs to capture him. At this point, Kimble has only been missing for several hours. Gerard doesn't know that Kimble is innocent and has no reason to suspect that he is. Kimble pleaded \"not guilty\" at trial, but that's meaningless. By definition, anyone who actually goes to trial pleads \"not guilty\". As a law enforcement officer, Gerard is probably well aware of guilty people who falsely claim innocence, especially prisoners. Gerard only begins to question Kimble's guilt later on, when Kimble has returned to Chicago. Gerard realizes that Kimble is taking crazy risks to look into aspects of his case. For a guilty man this would make no sense, and it gets Gerard wondering whether Kimble might actually be wrongly convicted.",
            "She was just a nameless good Samaritan who offered him a ride. The very next scene has Gerard's team going to apprehend someone and commenting that \"he's shacked up with a woman\". The audience is meant to think they're talking about Kimble and the woman, but they're actually talking about Copeland, the other escapee. The scene with the driver picking him up is thus supposed to be a red herring.",
            "Actually, it was Dr. Kimble that was the intended target, not Helen. Sykes had been hired by Dr Charles Nichols to kill Richard. Pay close attention: at the fundraiser, Nichols gives Richard back the keys to his car after having borrowed it. The events of the rest of the night are assumed when Gerard is looking over the phone records: Nichols phones Sykes from Kimble's car and then stops at the house to unlock the door. The plan was to kill Richard after he and Helen came home from the benefit. However, a wrench is thrown into the plan when Richard is called away to assist at a surgery, delaying his arrival at his home. When Sykes gets there, Helen is the only one at the house. Why Sykes kills Helen instead is unknown. Did she walk in and surprise Sykes? Did Sykes decide to frame Richard for murder? Or did he plan on killing both Helen and Richard to eliminate any potential witnesses? The answer is never revealed. Later in the movie, when Kimble asks Nichols the same question, \"Why Helen?\", he gets no answer either.",
            "Because he was beginning to suspect that Provasic, the new wonder drug being developed by the Devlin MacGregor Pharmaceutical Company, wasn't as miraculous a drug after all. Kimble was seeing more and more of the patients in the Provasic research program coming to surgery with severely damaged livers. The very night of Helen's murder, in fact, Kimble was called to perform surgery on yet another Provasic patient. The claim that the drug worked with no side effects, which Kimble was going to challenge, would have halted the release of the drug for general use and cost the drug company millions.",
            "By checking the hospital records he gets a list of men who had the same type of prosthetic that Helen's killer did. He then methodically tracks down and eliminates the men as suspects. When he breaks into Sykes's apartment he recognizes Sykes as the killer from a photograph. Checking through Sykes's things he sees paychecks from Devlin MacGregor and photos of Sykes with Lantz, a doctor who Kimble knew was working on Provasic. This causes Kimble to remember how much Devlin MacGregor was pushing Provasic and about his own discovery that Provasic may have been causing liver failure. Since he and Helen had no other connection to Sykes, he surmises that Provasic was the reason for the murder attempt.\nWhen Kimble found out that Lentz was already dead when the samples were switched, he knew that only Dr Charles Nichols had access at that point.",
            "Lentz was killed, because he, like Kimble stood in the way of the approval of RDU-90 so that Provasic could be sold by Devlin McGregor. Only his murder would enable Nichols to fully falsify the research regarding RDU-90 with Kimble already out of the way by falsifying the pathology reports of his, which he could only do so the day when Lentz was murdered without causing too much attention about it.",
            "Gerard was trying to demonstrate to Kimble that he was out of options. He could either trust him, give up peacefully, and take the chance that Gerard would help him-or he could keep running and trying to get away (thus proving he was guilty) and Gerard would be forced to shoot him.",
            "Standard procedure. Although Gerard believed Kimble to be innocent at this point he was still a wanted fugitive who had already escaped custody once. In addition, the Chicago police still believed that Kimble shot the transit cop, and gave orders to shoot to kill. They could not do so if he was in federal custody with Gerard escorting him to a car.",
            "There were many ambulances operating in that area, but what allowed Gerard to single out Kimble's ambulance was that it was not responding to radio calls, driving recklessly (like around downed grade crossing gates with its lights flashing), and operating outside its designated service area.",
            "After the manhunt for Kimble begins, there is noticeably no reference to Copeland (Eddie Bo Smith Jr.), whom the sheriff at the crash site had written off as dead. Perhaps the most likely explanation is that the authorities presumed that Kimble was the only inmate to survive. They only realized that Copeland also escaped when they failed to find his body in the wreckage. Copeland is not brought up until after the scene where Kimble accepts a ride from another woman. As he climbs in and she drives off with him, we cut to the U.S. Marshals' Chicago field office. Cosmo tells Gerard, \"We've got him - shacked up with some babe over in Whiting\", (a city in Indiana, not far from Chicago) who \"left work tonight and took him home\". This is intended to be a red herring: the audience is led to believe that they have a tip on Kimble getting picked up and that the marshals are going to get him. The next morning, Gerard and Noah Newman lead a raid on the house, where Newman is grabbed by Copeland (hiding out at his girlfriend's house). Copeland takes Newman hostage with his own gun and threatens to kill him unless he is given a car to escape the scene. Gerard shoots and kills Copeland with two shots from point blank range from his Glock 17, because, as he later whispers into Newman's deafened ear, \"I don't bargain.\" We later see him being reprimanded over the phone for his actions.",
            "Kimble would likely be given a new trial based off the changed circumstances. With the real culprits (Sykes and Nichols) in custody, as well as testimonial evidence provided by Gerard, Kimble will almost certainly be found innocent. Whether or not he resumes his former life practicing vascular surgery is up in the air. But Kimble will almost certainly go public with the evidence he gathered against Provasic and perhaps testify against Nichols and Sykes in their own trials.He probably would also act against the Chicago Police for having concealed the evidence that they had found Sykes (attempted murder against Kimble in their obsession to make him pay for his \"crime\" and because of a misplaced loyalty against an ex-cop (Sykes)), which contributed to Lentz's death and the death of the policeman from Chicago.It's plain that Kimble committed further crimes during his quest for justice (including fleeing an officer of the law, pointing a firearm at Gerard, breaking and entering, etc.) but with the public on his side he might possibly be pardoned.",
            "When Kimble first contacts Nichols he probably helps him in order to stay above suspicion and avoid a scene. He probably assumed that Kimble would be caught soon by the police and, in fact, when questioned by Gerard he readily offers up all the information he has about Kimble. This is in contrast to some of Kimble's other friends, who actually attempt to stall the Marshals. Later on, Nichols doesn't really offer any help to Kimble. All he does is tell him that Lentz is dead. It's possible that Nichols hoped that this would put Kimble off the Provasic theory of the crime."

Muldoon got outgambitted, essentially. He saw a raptor 'hiding' and thought that was the ambushing raptor which was just the bait whilst the real ambusher got into position. He's hunted all sorts of modern predators, but this is far more intelligence and cooperation than pretty much anything other than maybe lions on the savannahs or in the jungles.4. Muldoon has only ever observed them in captivity. Grant knew about the flanking maneuver because he's a dinosaur expert, but even then it was theoretical. Muldoon was a game warden and was an expert in modern animals. So while he was technically the most knowledgeable about Raptors because he's spent time observing living ones, he has never seen them hunt in the wild.",
            "Because they were being hunted. If Muldoon went in to the maintenance shed with Ellie, it would give time for the Raptors to re-locate or ambush them as they left the shed. Muldoon knew where at least one of the Raptors was. So he thought it best to draw them away from the shed and try and hunt them.",
            "Malcom probably thought the Rex was going to turn back, so he wanted to buy them more time. Grant immediately tries to tell Malcolm not to do it, so even this scene addresses that Malcom's decision was ill-judged.Alan Grant is a paleontologist. Ian Malcolm is a chaos theorist. Grant has studied dinosaurs all of his life. Malcolm hasn't. Grant is familiar with the notion of predatory motion-based vision. Malcolm isn't. When Grant threw the flare, Malcolm probably assumed it would distract the Rex for a second, before it turned back and went after Grant and the kids. and believed that by offering a new distraction, he was saving Grant's life. This is further demonstrated when he finally does throw the flare and keeps running; he didn't understand it was the motion the Rex was chasing. With the limited information about the situation that Malcolm possessed, what he did was remarkably heroic, luring the Rex away so that Grant could reach the children. Unfortunately, because of the information he did not possess, it was ultimately meaningless.",
            "Nedry likely chose that night to steal the embryos because the facility was down to a skeleton crew. With almost no employees around, it would be significantly easier to execute his plan. As we see, he never encounters a single employee.When Nedry speaks to \"the man on the boat\", it's likely Nedry's 18 minute window included when all the crew leaving for the boat would have been boarded, but before the boat cast off. Due to the storm, it appears the boat was leaving earlier than it was supposed to, so Nedry had to rush to complete their mission.",
            "Because that would have taken two years or more and the chances of success would've been minimal.In the novel, Mr Arnold is able to search the lines of code and find the precise one that Nedry inserted to start the program that disabled the system. After a few moments of investigation, Arnold is able to reverse what Nedry did.",
            "This was done as a potential set-up for a sequel. As the book for The Lost World hadn't been written yet, there was no Site B created. Once the second book was written, the sequel film was based on that idea and the Barbasol can became irrelevant.The shaving can does finally re-appear in the sixth film, Jurassic World: Dominion. In the possession of Lewis Dodgson, the man who originally gave Nedry the can in this film.",
            "No.In the original novel, and in Michael Crichton's drafts of the screenplay, Nedry's body is discovered by Muldoon, being eaten by compies. The point of this in the story is that weapons are kept in the Jeep (unbeknownst to Nedry) which are needed to sedate the Tyrannosaurus, so after Nedry's Jeep is found, Muldoon and Gennaro (who survives these versions of the story) are able to go hunting the rex. In David Koepp's 1992 drafts of the screenplay, the plot element of sedating the Tyrannosaurus was dropped from the story, so the discovery of Nedry's body was too.In 2011's Jurassic Park: The Game, Nedry's body is found by BioSyn associate Nima Cruz while searching for his Barbasol can. The game is considered \"soft-canon\" to the film series.",
            "No. While it is unclear whether he soiled his underwear upon experiencing the T-Rex knocking the toilet down around him, it is clear that he only ran to the toilet to hide from the dinosaur. In several shots, you can see that he is still wearing his khaki shorts when the T-Rex finds and eats him.A scene similar to this appeared in the book, though the unfortunate victim was Ed Regis, who does not appear in the film. Ed Regis is present during the main road attack in the book, and like Gennaro, he abandons the children upon seeing the T-Rex. The book makes clear that Regis urinates himself. The film shows a toilet nearby the road instead, which Gennaro runs to.",
            "Earlier in the film, Hammond mentions that \"they clocked the T. rex going 32 miles per hour,\" so the car could easily outrun it. Computer simulations using the T. rex's skeletal structure have found that it probably only ran at a maximum of 11-18 mph and that its legs, in ratio to the rest of its body, were not large enough to propel it beyond 25 mph. It was Ian's leaning back in terror that stopped the car from accelerating at first, resulting in the close shave before the getaway. When Ian leans back, he knocks the gear shift lever loose which put the Jeep in neutral. You can hear Muldoon shouting \"GET OFF THE STICK! BLOODY MOVE!!!\" to Ian.",
            "Lysine is an amino acid, one of the 'building blocks' of protein. Specifically, it is one of nine 'essential' amino acids that cannot be manufactured by the body and must be consumed in food. Sources of lysine include eggs, meat, soy, milk, Parmesan cheese, fish, and most grains and legumes. The lysine contingency plan called for withholding lysine from the dinosaurs' diets in order to kill them, if necessary.It was included in the construction of the animals' DNA so they could only survive with the diets provided in the park, i.e., they could not survive off the island. However, death by lack of lysine would take a long time, several weeks and even longer for the meat eaters since digestion of meat produces lysine. John Hammond was against using the plan for the obvious reason: He didn't want to kill off all the dinosaurs, lose his investment, and be forced to start all over again.While Hammond certainly felt an attachment to the animals is a plausible explanation of his decision can be ascertained by his exclamation to John Arnold that 'people are dying!', Arnold was adamant he didn't want to be responsible for rebooting the park systems as they may not have come back on at all and seemed more in favour of Muldoon's suggestion to use the lysine contingency. However, this would have taken too long to come into effect whereas 'theoretically' rebooting the system would have given them almost immediate control.",
            "While the film follows the plot relatively close, the book and film have several differences. Almost every character is somewhat different in the book than the film. For example:In the book Gennaro is a young, muscular man and is a fairly likeable character. Also, in the book, he lives. Near the end of the book, after the main characters part company with Hammond, Gennaro becomes a sort of scapegoat and is blamed by Grant for the dangers they are facing. In the second book (The Lost World) it is mentioned that he died of dysentary on a business trip in between the timeline of the two stories. There is another character named Ed Regis who works on the island and goes on the tour with the others, as Gennaro stayed with Ellie to look after the sick Stegosaurus in the book. In the film Gennaro is combined with many of Ed Regis' traits and is killed in a very similar way to Regis.Muldoon is pretty much the same in both the book and the film, only he is described as being South-African and might have a drinking problem, whereas in the film he is British. In the book he is wounded but lives. In the film he dies.Nedry is exactly the same, almost down to the last detail. He dies in the same way in both the film and the book, though the book is more graphic (he's disemboweled and his head is ripped off). In the film, he is portrayed as being solely motivated by greed. In the book, it's made clear that Hammond mislead him about the programming job he was given. It was far more time consuming and complicated for the pay he was getting. He planned to quit, but Hammond threatened him with a lawsuit and would make sure Nedry could never get a high-level job again if he tried to leave. So his motivations were more about fair compensation as well as settling a score against Hammond. Also, in the book he was planning to shut down the security system, deliver the embryos to some people on a boat, then return to the control room and reset everything to normal and nobody would be the wiser, but was killed before he could return to reset everything. In the film it is unclear whether he was deliberately sabotaging the park and was planning to escape on the boat, or if he was going to return to the control room. Though him stating he had an \"18 minute window\" suggests he was planning to return. He also left the raptor fence on, likely because it was a separate facility and not directly connected to the gate he needed to open and didn't want to risk them escaping.Dr. Harding has a brief appearance in the movie as the veterinarian looking after the sick Triceratops, but then leaves on the boat heading to the mainland. In the book, he stays on the Island throughout the whole ordeal. He is wounded by a Raptor, but lives.Dr. Henry Wu has a much more significant role in the book than in the film. In the book he explains in great detail how the dinosaurs are cloned, etc. He too stays on the island throughout the ordeal and is killed by Raptors near the end of the book. In the film he declares that he is leaving on a boat, meaning he survives the film and returns in Jurassic WorldIn the film Ray Arnold is the lead computer engineer. In the book his name is John Arnold (it was changed most likely due to the fact that there was a character named John Hammond, and having two Johns in the film might be confusing, though some sources name him as \"John Raymond Arnold\"). His traits are very similar in both the book and the film. In the book, he is also a US Navy veteran. In the film he goes missing and Ellie finds his severed arm. In the book, the reader follows him into the maintenance shed, where he's gutted by a raptor.Ian Malcolm is described in the same way in both the book and the film, except in the book he is 'a balding man'. In the film he is witty and also provides the comic relief. In the book he is still humourous and witty at times, but mostly he's much more serious, philosophical and at times condescending. He and John Hammond absolutely loathe each other in the book, whereas in the film, Hammond only seems annoyed by Malcolm, as Malcolm never passes up an opportunity to get on Hammond's nerves. In the book he panics, runs out of the car and gets bitten by the Rex, which in turn breaks his leg in several places. In the film, he nobly distracts the Rex with a flare in order for Grant to rescue the kids. He is sent flying into the bathroom hut on the snout of the Rex, breaking his leg. In the book he dies from his injury, but he is resurrected for the second book by saying \"I only appeared dead, but the surgeons did excellent work to revive me.\"Alan Grant is very casual in the book. He wears tattered jeans, sneakers, and has a beard. In the film he is much more clean-cut, wearing collared shirts and khaki pants, and is clean-shaven. Also, in the book he likes kids, whereas in the film he initially hates kids, but grows to enjoy their company as the film progresses. Near the end of the book, having survived the trek through the jungle, he becomes hostile towards Gennaro in Hammond's absence and blames him for the circumstances they and the rest of the survivors are facing.In the book, Tim is eleven years old and the eldest of the children, while he is two years younger in the film. Lex is only seven and doesn't provide much to the plot in the book whereas, in the film, she is twelve years old and plays an equal role to her screen brother. Tim is the one who is good with computers and helps activate the park security systems in the book while also aware he has to protect his sister. Lex becomes the computer expert in the film, while Tim is the dinosaur expert.John Hammond is very different in the book. He is arrogant, deceptive, disrespectful and rude, and described as almost dwarf-like in his appearance. He recognises the consequences of his experiments but disregards them in the name of profit. He also tries to blame all the faults of the park on his employees, dismissing the park's failure on the supposed incompetence of Wu, Arnold, Nedry, Harding and Muldoon. In the film he is still eccentric but he is very friendly, honest and generous, and does not appear to fully grasp the reality of what he's done until the end of the film; at one point in the movie he criticizes Gennaro's idea of the park as a playground for the rich, which is essentially what the Hammond in the book is trying to create. In the book he refuses to leave the island with Grant and instead ventures off into the park by himself, where he injures himself falling down a cliff and is summarily eaten by chicken-like dinosaurs called Procompsognathus (which appear in the second and briefly in the third film). In the film he survives, and makes an appearance in later films.Ellie Sattler is described as being 23, tanned, and is noticed more by the male characters. In the film she is dating Grant and is rather reserved. In the book she is Grant's student and is engaged to someone else.Lewis Dodgson gets a bit more mention in the book and its sequel, The Lost World. His role in both the book and the film are pretty much the same: he meets Nedry and pays him off, then isn't seen again. However, a bit more background on his character is given in the book. In the second book, The Lost World, he is the main antagonist and is killed at the end. In the films he pays off Nedry and is never seen again.At one point in the novel, Alan, Lex, and Tim ride a boat down a river, one of the rides yet to be completed. While on the boat they are chased by the swimming T-Rex and enter a large birdcage with Cearadactylus. Both events were eventually used in Jurassic Park III, though the T-Rex is replaced with a Spinosaurus.In the book, at one point Lex, Tim and Grant are behind a waterfall and the T-Rex attempts to attack them. Though the opening was too small for the Rex to get his head in. This idea was used in the second film, The Lost WorldThe beginning of the book has a wounded worker being airlifted to a local hospital in Costa Rica; before dying he mutters, \"Raptor\". In the film we see this worker being attacked by the Raptor (though not too graphically), but it is only mentioned later on that he died.Shortly after the worker died, the book follows a family on vacation on the main land of Costa Rica. When on the beach, their young daughter is attacked by these chicken-like lizards, which turned out to be Procompsognathus. It begs the question as to how these small dinosaurs had gotten off the island. In the film, this scene never happens, though it did in the sequel The Lost World: Jurassic Park (albeit on Isla Sorna as opposed to Costa Rica).At the end of the book, Isla Nublar gets napalmed, completely wiping out every living thing on the island. Hence the need for a site B in the second book. In the film, no such thing is said to have happened. A deleted scene in the The Lost World mentions that the \"original facility was destroyed\", referencing the sequence in the book where this happens. Though because it was deleted, it isn't considered canon. Also, Jurassic World takes place on Isla Nublar. So it's likely that the original facility being destroyed may have been due to a hurricane or some other natural element. The visitor's appears in Jurassic World briefly, still intact, but decimated and over-grown with plant life, in the restricted zone of the island.In the book, the facility isn't manned by a skeleton crew of three due to an incoming storm. There are dozens of people still working on the island, including general labourers who are working to finish construction on the island and several are killed when the raptors get loose.In the book, the Velociraptors are described as having a snout like a crocodile and they are only about 4 feet tall (though one is described as being 6 feet tall). Still larger than their real life counterparts which were about 1 and a half to 2 feet tall. In the film, they are about 6 feet tall and share more physical traits with the larger Utahraptor."

            "According to an article on Shmoop \"Forrest Gump opens and closes with the image of a white feather floating through the air. In the opening, it comes to rest in Forrest's suitcase. At the end, it flies back up into the air, helping to symbolize the cycle that has now been completed- specifically, the cycle of life and death, and of new beginnings. After all, the first day of school just like Forrest did at the beginning go the movie. It symbolizes Forrest's view of life rather than Lt. Dan's; there's no big destiny endgame we're all trying to achieve, there's just a random series of events knocking us about.\"",
            "There is no explicit confirmation that forrest and jenny had sex\nIn the late stages of the movie, Jenny comes back into Forrest's life to spend some time at his home. The two reconnect after years of tension that finally culminates in a bedroom scene that, allegedly, changes their connection permanently. The two share a passionate kiss, Jenny climbs in his bed, and the implication is that the two had sex.\nWith that said, there's no explicit confirmation that happened. There's a litany of other things a couple can get into in that circumstance, and sex is only one of them. In fact, Forrest is a virgin to that point in Forrest Gump, so he's largely ignorant of the act required to create a son. Jenny, to be honest, probably knew that, so there would likely be little to no worry on her end of being discovered.\nbut by no means do we know Forrest and Jenny had sex. And even then, we only know they had sex once. We all know once is all it takes, but given the context of the rest of the points, it certainly makes the odds of Forrest being the father much less certain.\nIn the context of Forrest Gump, we're to believe that Jenny had her night with Forrest, fled in the morning, and then nine months later had a baby. She then returns an undetermined amount of time later with Forrest Jr. and informs Forrest that the boy is his. Forrest is shocked by the news, but eventually snaps out of it and joins Forrest Jr. for an episode of Sesame Street.\nThere's quite a gap of time between Forrest Jr.'s birth and Jenny's revelation to Forrest though. Jenny mentions that he's one of the brightest kids in school, which would presumably put him in the kindergarten age range of 5. Jenny spent five years past Forrest Jr.'s birth to reveal him to Forrest, and only really decides he should know his father when she gets sick.\nIt's safe to say Forrest would've been a part of that child's life at any point in that process, and he would've been thrilled to have Jenny around. Why did she stay away and raise a child alone, Perhaps she wasn't alone and had another relationship with another man. In either case, there had to be something keeping Jenny away for so long, and one would think it wasn't her fear of Forrest's reaction that he had a son.When Jenny first shows up at Forrest's home, she's looking to leave the hard life she's led to that point behind. Forrest gladly takes her in, but does notice that Jenny seems to be very fatigued throughout the visit. Forrest specifically notes that \"She just sleeps, and sleeps like she hasn't slept for days.\" What happened to Jenny that made her so sleepy.\nAt that time dna tests did not exist. So, the only person who could have known the paternity of little Forrest was Jenny and I doubt she was 100% certain herself.About the only thing we can rely on is an assessment of Jenny's character to determine if she was probably telling the truth.Throughout her adult life (up to a point), she is portrayed as a free spirit, leading a high-risk lifestyle. She is shown singing nude at a strip club, leading a hippie and promiscuous lifestyle, and taking hard-core drugs.\nShe loves and deeply cares for Forrest as a \"lifelong friend,\" but there is no romantic connection (at least on her part). For this reason, she turns down his marriage proposal (in Greenboro).\nAt the low point of her life (around 1975 I'm guessing), she is shown in a dirty hotel room, dressed like a slut, with drugs everywhere. She steps onto the balcony, tears rolling down her face and is ready to jump to her death (about 10 flights down).\nSeveral years later (it appears), [actually, the next scene we see her in, following the drug scene] she shows up unexpectedly at Forrest's house in Greenboro, sometime after his mother has passed away. Her appearance is a complete opposite from the previous time we see her. Her face is clear, is neatly groomed and appears to be clear thinking.\nHowever, we receive our first clues she is sick. Forrest says, \"She just sleeps, and sleeps like she hasn't slept for days.\"\nForrest proposes after they get reconnected, but Jenny declines. He is heart-broken. \"Why don't you love me, Jenny?\"\nLater that evening (after the proposal), Jenny crawls into Forrest's bed (he was originally sleeping alone), and sleeps with him. Removing her nightgown, the presumption is that they had sex.\nThe next day, she gets into a taxi, disappearing, once again. Forrest is naturally heartbroken, once again.\nI get the feeling that Jenny was already late when she visited Forrest. I don't think that she would have slept with him otherwise. Jenny always rebuffed his attempts at courtship before. She wasn't prepared for a relationship and she knew that he wasn't prepared for the consequences of sex.She knew that if she was pregnant, her child would need a father. So, she slept with Forrest to create the possibility that Forrest could be a father. Ultimately, it doesn't matter if Forrest really was the father because Forrest loved Jenny and if Jenny needed him to take care her child he would. There is a lot we can learn from Forrest Gump.\nThere are a lot of reasons, one of them being she's in the early stages of pregnancy. Fatigue is a big part of pregnancy, and it's possible Jenny arrived at Forrest's doorstep already pregnant. Perhaps she realized her lifestyle was no place to raise a child, and that there was always that option where she could settle down and have a comfortable life with Forrest. He'd be a great father and she'd never have to worry or want for anything ever again.After some time there, Jenny gets cold feet because she realizes she could never love Forrest, or maybe feels guilty about the plan she made. Jenny then leaves, perhaps deciding to bear the responsibility for the child on her own. It's only when she realized she's dying that she returned, realizing that her initial plan is now the only way to give her child a good life and ensure his safety.It's hard to push the issue that Forrest Jr. is not Forrest Gump's child when Jenny literally named him after the father. Why would she do that if she felt otherwise? If someone else was the father, wouldn't they think it's a bit weird she named her son after her very famous childhood friend, but seemingly has no relationship with him through a bulk of Forrest Jr.'s lifeThere are probably a lot of opinions about this. But alot of fans agree that he is indeed the fatherBut one thing that sure is indicated that he actually is the father is that there are two clues in the movie. Their inclusion into the movie plot indicate that the creators wanted you to conclude that Little Forrest is in fact Forrest's biological son.When Forrest first finds out about being a father, he asks if he can be with Little Forrest. He goes over to him, sits down, and they both start watching TV. From that point on their actions are identical: They get caught up in the show at the same time, and they tilt their heads slightly to the left at the same time.Later on, we see that they both love the same things naturally. Little Forrest loves to fish. Once again they get caught up in the sitting \"action\" of fishing with their heads tilted slightly to the left.Forrest also asks Jenny (when he sort of understands it's his son), if the boy is like him (ie. somewhat challenged), to which Jenny replies \"No\". So Forrest obviously think it's his son (and Jenny probably got why he asked, but didn't correct the assumption)\nBeyond that, Jenny had never lied to Forrest before and there was no reason to doubt her about Forrest being the father.",
            "Several possibilities:1) He may have left her, or he was born out of wedlock.2) Its a euphemism for him having abandoned them; just without having to say it outright. A slightly later scene with Forrest asking what vacation means, and his mother tells him it's when someone goes away and doesn't ever come back. Which seems like a sanitised version of \"deadbeat father running off\", suitable for a child.3) It could be that he's deceased, but Forrest seems to understand the concept of going to heaven so I would probably argue that he left either getting a divorce or just leaving for whatever reason.",
            "Forrest Gump (Born June 6, 1944) is a idiot from Greenbow, Alabama. Although he is well meaning and good hearted, he is slow and has a average IQ. Forrest lived with his mother and suffered a disability which he couldn't walk properly. He met his long time best friend and future wife Jenny Curran who lived with her abusive father. Forrest later became a American football player. A Vietnam veteran. A ping pong player. A Shrimp boat captain. Businessman and runner. Forrest met famous deceased celebrities such as Elvis Prestley. John Lennon and John F. Kennedy. During his time in Vietnam, Forrest became friends with Bubba Blues and his superior officer Lt. Dan Taylor. Bubba was killed in action and Lt. Dan Taylor was wounded and both his legs were amputated. After his mother died from cancer. Forrest impregnated Jenny and years later, Forrest met his young son Forrest, Jr. However, Forrest would be rocked with tragedy again when Jenny told Forrest she was dying from an unknown illness and Forrest agreed to marry her and to raise Forrest, Jr. back in Greenbow and Forrest became a single father and was left to raise Forrest alone when Jenny passed away.",
            "The makers of Forrest Gump identify themselves as political liberals (in American parlance). However, since the film was released in 1994, some scholars have argued that it promotes conservative ideals, rejecting Jenny's counterculture habits (showing her dying of hepatitis C as a result of her choices) and rewarding Forrest's 1950s family values and clean-cut behavior with long life and financial success. Others consider this a manipulative reading of the film. Read both sides of the discussion here.",
            "Those who have both seen the movie and read the book say that there are quite a few differences. Generally, they say that the book is even sillier than the movie and that the book doesn't have the tragedy that the movie has. Forrest lives with Jenny for a long time before Jenny gets fed up with him and leaves. The book, more so than the film, pokes fun at Forrest. There's a long, slapstick sequence where Forrest spends time with his buddy Sue the orangutan. Forrest is more cynical and abrasive in the novel, and his fantastic adventures are the primary focus as opposed to the love story. Jenny and Mrs. Gump do not die in the novel."

Butch is extremely fortunate: his timing couldn't have been better when he entered his apartment while Marsellus was gone and Vincent was in the bathroom. Vincent probably hears Butch come in, but believing it is Marsellus, is not alarmed. As Butch is driving away after having retrieved his watch and killed Vincent, he encounters Marsellus on his way back to the apartment, carrying a box of donuts and two cups of coffee. The \"trivia track\" on the DVD confirms this interpretation to be correct. An added explanation that does not disagree with the above but adds a psychological dimension is that Vincent is demonstrably very careless with guns. In another scene, this carelessness costs someone else (Marvin) his life. Here, Vincent carelessly assumes that Butch would not be dumb enough to come back to his own apartment and, so, allows the gun to go unattended in the kitchen while he uses the facilities. Also, Marsellus and Vincent could have been waiting for anyone to come to Butch's apartment to interrogate them as to Butch's whereabouts: Butch could have sent Fabienne to get his watch thinking Marsellus and Vincent wouldn't know who she was.\n(Also, Vincent is seen to be using the facilities more often than any other character in the movie, at least three times, twice while reading the same book. The theme throughout the film is that whenever Vincent goes into the bathroom, something bad happens: Mia overdoses on his heroin, he's killed by Butch, and he finds himself in the middle of Pumpkin & Honeybunny's robbery of the restaurant.) It's also not out of the realm of possibility that Vincent didn't even know Marsellus had put the MAC-10 on the counter. If Vincent likes to read while using the restroom, it's entirely possible he was in there a while and may have been in there before Marsellus even left. Heroin addiction is known to cause constipation making that even more likely.",
            "The overarching theme of the movie is retaining one's honor in the face of adversity. Butch was going to skip town and go on the run from Marsellus but he realizes that leaving Marsellus to be raped or worse by Maynard and Zed was dishonorable. When he selects a weapon (claw hammer, baseball bat, chain saw) they're all pretty messy things to use as weapons. The sword is associated with samurai, a position of honor in feudal Japan. Also, the sword is literally longer and more deadly than any of the other weapons he sifts through before he finds it. It's unlikely that Butch is an experienced user of the sword but he was also counting on surprise; Butch wouldn't have to get as close to Maynard or Zed to use it and risk them being able to counterattack very easily. The hammer isn't very practical because it doesn't have much striking distance. The chain saw has a very short blade and starting it would have quickly alerted Maynard and Zed giving them plenty of reaction time. And the bat has the length but Butch would risk a non-fatal injury that one of the guys could bounce back from. Look at the fear on Zed's face when Butch taunts him to pick up his pistol. Zed knows that Butch could easily cut his hand off in one stroke or injure him enough to land a second stroke and kill him then.",
            "It's a question of honor, which is a major theme in all of Tarantino's films: Butch puts himself in Marsellus' position and decides that he would hate to be left to such a horrid fate; he cannot just leave somebody there, no matter who it is. Butch does the \"right thing\" to put it simply; he realises that Maynard and Zed cannot get away with what they are doing to anybody-who knows how many people they've raped, tortured or even killed in Maynard's basement prior to Marsellus and Butch stumbling into the shop?Butch may have also considered saving Marsellus an act of redemption. By saving his skin, he may have hoped that Marsellus would forgive him and let him go, if not, Butch may have killed Marsellus himself. Notice how Butch still stood ready to swing with the sword when he asked, \"What now?\" The former becomes the case, whether that was Butch's intention or not. Also, if Marsellus ever escaped and learned that Butch had left him there to his fate, Marsellus would sure unleash even more retaliation against Butch than he was subject to after double-crossing him at the fight.Consider the weapon Butch chooses: a samurai sword. The samurai are long-associated with honour towards their masters. If you want to simplify the overarching theme of the film, you could say it's about honor among thieves. There is also a clue to why Butch saves Marsellus; in the flashback scene with Christopher Walken's Captain Koons, and the young Butch. In the scene, Koons is relating his imprisonment with Butch's father, and tells Butch, \"Hopefully, you'll never have to experience this yourself, but when two men are in a situation like me and your dad were, for as long as we were, you take on certain responsibilities of the other.\" It's possible that these words came to Butch's mind as he was attempting to leave the pawn shop.",
            "The entire reason Winston was sent to deal with \"The Bonnie Situation\" was because he's an incredibly efficient cleaner -- \"I think fast and I need you boys to act fast!\" Jimmy was already furious with Jules and Vincent for bringing a blood-soaked car with a dead body in the back seat to his house. Jules points out that Jimmy was incredibly close to kicking them out as it was, while Jules wouldn't allow that to happen before Marvin had been dealt with, he didn't want it to reach that point, as Jimmy was his friend. Winston was looking for the fastest way to get Vincent and Jules cleaned up, as well as get rid of any trace they were ever there before Jimmy's wife Bonnie arrived home from her night shift, while also trying to appease Jimmy's disapproval of the entire situation he had been put in. Had they taken turns in the shower, this would take up a significant amount of time. As the average male spends approximately 10 minutes in the shower, having to scrub the blood and brains off possibly extending this time to 15 to 20 minutes each. That's 30 to 40 minutes total, as well as making a bloody mess in the tub which would have to be cleaned, using up even more time, (keep in mind the car had to be cleaned as well). Also, it may have raised suspicion with Bonnie to arrive home to find the shower had been cleaned first thing in the morning, which could lead to her questioning Jimmy, which he risks being caught in a lie. The most efficient and safe method was to have them strip naked in the back yard and hose them both down at the same time. Any remaining blood and brain matter that was sprayed off of them could easily be washed away with the hose and Bonnie wouldn't be the wiser.",
            "Mia is a cocaine user, and when she sees the heroin in Vincent's coat pocket, she just assumes that it is cocaine-it's a white powder in a plastic baggie, and it looks just like coke. The problem is that, when Vincent goes to Lance's house to score heroin, Lance informs him he is out of balloons and asks if a baggie would be all right. (Heroin is usually stashed by dealers in balloons, not baggies, most likely to avoid situations just like this! It is also put in balloons so if you are caught with it or need to safely transport it you can swallow it quickly then \"retrieve\" it later. Mia might have known the difference if Lance had been able to use a balloon.) The heroin he purchases is also described by Lance as being extremely potent (a \"mad man\"). Heroin is a depressant, whereas cocaine is a stimulant, the most likely reason for the overdose. Fortunately, Vincent gets her to Lance's house in time to save her with the adrenaline shot. (The whole heroin/cocaine mix-up is foreshadowed in Lance's comments to Vince, \"Coke is dead as... dead. Heroin is coming back in a big way.\")",
            "Vince was having a very bad morning! He was almost killed by a man who was shooting at him, then he accidentally shot Marvin in the face while they were driving, which made a mess of the car, himself and Jules. Jules gives Vincent a hard time over it despite it being an accident, had to \"take shit\" from the Wolf, Jules and Jimmy; he had to help Jules clean up all the brains, blood and skull that used to be Marvin's head and Jules forces him to take the messier part of cleaning up the car; he had to strip down naked and get hosed down with freezing cold water in order to clean the blood off himself; he had to wear dorky clothes given to him by Jimmy, and finally he was caught in the middle of a Mexican stand-off at the diner when he and Jules went to breakfast. To top it all off, his best friend and partner (Jules) had just decided to quit the business they were in, right after Vincent had come back from several years living in Amsterdam -- he was probably looking forward to reconnecting with his old friend and getting back into the business and enjoying life in the USA again.This was all in the span of about 3 or 4 hours, a LOT of bad luck in a short time. So Vince finally shows up at his destination, then gets teased by Paul the bartender about his taking Mia out to dinner, when Butch came up to the bar. Vince probably knew or assumed why Butch was at the bar -- Marsellus was paying him to take a dive. Vincent may not respect people who are willing to betray their principles for money. So when Butch asked if he was looking at something, Vince took the opportunity to insult him.",
            "Vincent called Butch \"Palooka,\" a reference to a cartoon character named Joe Palooka, who was portrayed in a long-running comic series as a heavyweight boxing champion. In Vincent's eyes, \"Palooka\" would be a derogatory term for boxers in general, implying he looked down on Butch for his profession. It's also a fairly popular euphemism from the 1950s to refer to anyone who appears oafish or dumb. Butch is obviously not either but it was a convenient insult for Vincent to use. After Butch asks, \"What's that?\" Vincent says, \"I think you heard me just fine, Punchy,\" obviously another crack at Butch's profession, because the term \"punchy\" when referring to boxers is a word used to describe a boxer who has been in the game too long and has been punched too much and it shows -- they may look battered physically or may be slow-witted because of brain damage. In Butch's case, neither was the case but Vincent, already in a bad mood, decided to chide him about it anyway."

Perhaps the grapple gun was out of cable, after using it to save both Chase and Robin.Batman also destroys The Riddler's mind control machine while The Riddler's mind was still connected to it. This could very easily have killed Riddler. But it didn't. Afterwards, Riddler is left twisted and near death. There was no reason for Batman to murder a defenseless person.

Batman leaps in after them and manages to save both, landing safely on some scaffolding. Suddenly Two-Face appears to taunt Batman. As Two-Face flips his coin to determine whether or not to kill Batman, Batman tosses several other coins into the air above him. Flailing drastically to capture his real coin, Two-Face falls off the scaffolding and plunges to his death. Riddler is placed in Arkham Asylum, and Chase is called in for consultation when he keeps screaming that he knows Batman's true identity. When Chase asks him who is Batman, Edward claims that he is Batman while flapping the shredded sleeves of his strait jacket like a bat. Chase assures Bruce that Riddler is \"wacko\" and that his secret is safe. Bruce returns the Malaysian dream warden to Chase and thanks her for giving him a new dream. In the final scene, Batman and Robin are seen running together in the glow of the bat signal."

            "Ramsey was testing the readiness of his crew and Cmdr Hunter under the most extreme conditions. You'll notice when the fire breaks out and he's been alerted to it, he waits until they report that the fire has been contained, then immediately orders the drill. Ramsey is testing how well the crew and Hunter would handle such a situation: it's entirely plausible that a fire could break out right before or immediately after the boat had received an EAM. In such a situation, the captain would have to prioritize both events and decide what was more important to resolve: the launching of his missiles according to order, or a fire on his sub. Knowing that at least part of his crew had been trained to deal with the fire, he decided to let them handle it and continue with his drill, which could easily have been a real-life scenario. Though once someone suffered a heart attack, the drill was cancelled. As Ramsey explains to Hunter that during war, distractions and chaos can happen. So it's not wise to only run drills when everything is hunky dory.Hunter plainly disagreed, thinking that the danger from the fire outweighed a missile drill. A fire aboard a submersed submarine is extremely serious since breathable air is a priority and the fire was burning a lot of it. Also, despite the fact that Hunter himself had hit the switch for the extinguishers and it was at least temporarily contained, he believed it could flare up again and created an even more dangerous situation. Hunter also seemed perturbed that Ramsey wasn't taking the fire seriously enough.",
            "The dialogue, which was added by Quentin Tarantino in the role of \"script doctor\", serves three purposes.First, the seemingly irrelevant conversation mirrors the main conflict of the film, where Ramsey and Hunter have conflicting informations and are \"both right\" but also \"both wrong\" about some of them.Second, it carries a subtext of racial tension (Ramsey claims the horses are white, Hunter that they are born black) which is implied thoughout the movie between the older, white Ramsey and the younger, black Hunter.Third, it allows for more elegant closure at the end. When Ramsey jokingly comments \"You were right, and I was wrong. About the horses, the Lipizzaners. They are from Spain, not Portugal\", he is implicitly admitting Hunter was correct about the nuclear missiles scenario without directly addressing the matter, which would be hard and out-of-character for the proud Ramsey.",
            "To set up the answer, you have to understand the rebel's initial grievances\nwith the US.Radchenko's forces threatened nuclear attack on the US and Japan after the US got involved in Chechnya's rebellion that spread to neighboring countries. Russia has always considered the volatility of Chechnya to be an internal matter. Considering this has (fictionally) taken place a few years after the Cold War, nationalists were worried about the expansion of NATO and the US. To keep out American advisors and possible ground forces, nuclear attack was used as a deterrent.However, that deterrent was ultimately a gun to their own heads. Even if they never intended to really launch, fueling their missiles that all bets were off. \"You don't put on a condom if you intend to f-.\" An SLBM strike by US subs would mean that Russian soldiers and possibly civilians would die. An unanswered retaliatory strike might destabilize the Russian government further, indicating weakness, and inviting more war and more Russian civilian deaths. But if rebel forces were to get any missiles off the ground, the US would retaliate and kill more Russian civilians.But ultimately, it was confronting their own invading troops that caused to the rebels to realize that what they were really doing. If they fiercely and successfully resisted, they would be killing their own comrades, and thereby killing their own people when the nukes are used. Either way, Russian civilians would die. Surrendering would be the only option to save those lives. What they hoped to accomplish by capturing the nuclear base ultimately proved useless."

            "As Waingro says \"I'm a cowboy. Looking for anything heavy.\". Essentially he's a psychopath that loves violence and carnage with very little regard for himself or anyone else, which is also why he guns down a defenseless guard. It's also possible that they could have wiped down the truck while waiting for the armored car to arrive, as Waingro's gear was in the truck with Cheritto -- Michael could have easily passed him a rag or something similar and told him to wipe down any spot on the truck he touched with his bare hands. It's also possible that the reason Waingro was hired for the job was because they simply needed an extra man for crowd control. So they hired Waingro through a contact. Since he had never met the team before, had he gotten caught, there's very little information he could give about Neil and the crew. However, once Waingro killed the guard and put them all on the hook for first degree murder, he became a major liability and had to be killed.",
            "The most probable explanation is that Neil believed that the job required an extra man. Three men to control the three guards (who would have been armed, initially), one man to grab the bonds, and a getaway driver. The odd thing is that Waingro seems to have never met the crew as he and Mike had never met each other. Neil probably went to a contact he trusted (Nate) about hiring an extra man for the job. For Waingro to be recruited into Neil's crew, he may have had a background in carrying out heists.Once they had Waingro, Neil had likely met with him beforehand (as Waingro seemed to know how tight the crew was with each other) and explained the job to him. I.e. \"You'll meet up with my guy Mike. You'll be in the tow truck that'll be used to ram the armoured car. After that you'll just be crowd control. Keep the guards from doing anything stupid.\" That's really all the job details Waingro would need. This would also limit the crew's exposure if Waingro was a snitch or undercover cop. Having not met the rest of the crew or had explicit details about the job that he could divulge to the police, Waingro could be cut loose of the crew if need be. Also possible Neil and crew would use Waingro as a scapegoat and all agree to give up Waingro as the mastermind if they were to all be apprehended. Possibly giving them reduced sentences, and keeping their main crew intact. Though that may still be considered ratting and strongly frowned upon in their line of work.Unfortunately, the lack of vetting on Waingro kept Neil blind to the fact that Waingro was a psychopath that was on the job more for the opportunity to kill someone and put them all at risk. Neil might be very cautious and good in his line of work, but he is still capable of making mistakes. And the mistake of Neil allowing Waingro to join his crew would play a major role in his eventual downfall.",
            "It's just scrap paper. There's a very brief shot of Neil holding the opened package and pulling out some of the paper as they walk away from the scene. Doubtless Neil had every intention of checking the package before he'd let the drop-off guy leave the scene -- he had the guy take his hands off the wheel first -- but the other gunman hiding the truck bed was supposed to kill Neil before he'd have the chance to open it.",
            "In the scene where Neil meets with Nate (Jon Voight) and Nate passes on the info he was able to collect on Vincent and his unit, Nate says very quickly that Neil and his guys have been bugged. Nate doesn't go into to very much detail but Neil is professional and knowledgeable enough to assume that it means their phones are tapped, their homes are being watched and their vehicles have all been lowjacked and perhaps more. Nate also mentions that he has at least one connection in the LAPD -- a corrupted officer or other official -- that gave him the info on Vincent and his team as well as their surveillance methods.Neil and his crew would have coordinated with each other on the issue of surveillance, just like they do on their robbery jobs. Neil would contact them all -- most likely in person or send word some other way and tell them \"at 10pm sharp, we all dump everything.\". They'd then swap cars with ones that wouldn't be traced, which would allow them to get away from police visually surveilling them and they would also leave behind any cell phones, beepers or any other electronic equipment that the police would have bugged. Then the crew all meet at a pre-determined hideout until the job is complete.",

            "Waingro and Benny were following Trejo. They then took Trejo's wife hostage and beat the bank heist information out of Trejo before killing his wife and leaving him for dead.It's possible that Trejo mistook Waingro and Benny following him for the police when he called Neil to tell him the \"cops are on me like a cheap suit.\"",
            "First, they didn't blackmail Trejo, they captured him, threatened to kill his wife and then brutally beat Trejo for the bank information. Trejo had already pulled out of the bank job when he thought the cops were following him.They didn't know for certain the heist wouldnt go ahead without Trejo. But they passed along the information to the cops anyway in the hopes Neil and his crew would get caught or better yet, killed. It's also possible Neil would have gone through with the heist only one of them would have driven the car themselves. It would be riskier, but as Chris and Neil both said, the job was worth the risk.",
            "He's likely doing that to soften the bundles up. After they've been slammed around a bit, the bundle will loosen up and the bag will mold itself to whomever carries it. Neil and his crew will be able to more easily exit the bank, especially through the revolving front doors, whereas a stiff bundle could get stuck if it added too much girth to the carrier.",
            "Donald Breedan (Dennis Haysbert) is a minor but still important character who was a recently-paroled ex-convict. He was determined to set his life straight with his wife's support. When he gets a job as a cook at a diner, he is extorted and treated poorly by the restaurant manager, who is implied to have a history of treating paroled cons that way. He tries to endure it but when Neil comes by with an opportunity of a lifetime, he reluctantly accepts, filling in for Trejo as the getaway car driver. His small, but significant story represents the tragic tale of how many people don't want to give ex-convicts a second chance to start fresh, often causing these people to get coaxed or forced back into a life of crime.",
            "The three thieves, Michael Cheritto, Chris Shiherilis and Neil MaCauley, each left the bank carrying a large bag full of cash. Cheritto was killed during the robbery, therefore assuming the bags each had an equal amount of cash in them, his third was seized by the police. However Neil and Chris escape the main shootout each with their bags of cash. Neil went to get Chris, but he had already left; assuming they both kept their shares, then Chris got away with his share. Neil's share was in the car and lost when Vincent chased him down.In the sequel novel Heat 2 (spoilers for the novel):\n-\n-\nChris escapes in to Mexico and Nate sets up an account for him to access the money.",
            "No. The police, Sgt Drucker specifically, offer Charlene a deal: she \"helps\" the police by calling her husband and getting him to show up at the apartment to be arrested. Drucker offered Charlene immunity so she could start a new life with her son Dominick. Drucker explains that Dominick is in danger of entering the \"system\" if he becomes an orphan and it may lead him to a life of crime and incarceration, specifically mentioning two of California's most famous max security prisons at the towns of Chino and Tracy. If Charlene refuses to give Chris up, the police will charge her with being an accessory to Chris' crimes and she will go to jail and lose their son. At the safe house, Charlene gives Chris a signal so he can get away - a very risky move on her part since the police appear to be watching her very closely - but the police and Drucker - who are trying to watch her and hide at the same time, which can be difficult considering the layout of the safehouse -- do not see the signal. As far as they know she was making good on her deal to help them, and he just didn't show. Therefore they have no reason to revoke their deal. They probably just assumed that he wouldn't risk coming for her and left her behind. Additionally, Chris had cut his hair very short to disguise himself and had false ID made up in the interim between when Neil left him and when he left Nate's house. It is also reasonable to guess that even if Drucker suspected her of warning off Chris that he would not actually \"victimize Dominick\" as he had threatened to do. And without being able to charge Chris for the crime it would be difficult to convict her of being an accessory to it.",
            "Yes. Detective Bosko is killed, shot in the neck by Shiherlis during the initial exchange of gunfire between himself, Cherrito, and Hanna's detectives. The officer who is shot in the chest by Neil in the grocery store parking lot is unclear. Though it looks like he was shot in the heart, he may have survived, as he was likely wearing body armour. The officers behind the police car roadblock most likely do survive. There is a black officer with a shotgun who gets shot by Neil, but is then seen pulling another wounded officer behind a police car for safety. The only officer who definitely was killed was Bosko, and he probably was the only police casualty resulting from the shootout, since his picture is the only one displayed on the news, and the other officers were either just severely wounded or had bullets stopped by body armor.",
            "Presumably, Hanna knew that Neil habitually monitored police frequencies, since undoubtedly, in the forensics investigation into the armored car robbery, they found remains of the police scanners in the ambulance (and would probably have assumed that he did so anyway given how well prepared and technically adroit Neil's crew had proven to be). Therefore he would have used encrypted frequencies within his team and possibly employed cell phones to contact the patrol units (in addition to just grabbing whatever uniformed officers were present in the police station when the information came in). Once the shooting starts, the dispatcher's center would have been flooded with 9-1-1 calls leaving Neil's crew no choice but to quickly blast their way out before the essentially endless stream of police reinforcements overwhelm them (we see additional officers start arriving as Hanna chases Neil and the wounded Shiherlis into the parking lot).",
            "The ThievesNeil McCauley escapes the final robbery with Chris Shiherlis. While heading to his new escape route with his girlfriend Eady, Nate calls him to tell him that Neil is in the clear. Nate is also compelled to tell Neil where Waingro was hiding. Neil decides to settle the score with Waingro. As Neil is heading back to his car where Eady is waiting for him, he sees Hanna walking towards him. Neil hesitates, but then decides to leave Eady behind to escape on his own. Hanna chases him into an airfield and Neil gets the drop on Hanna. Fortunately for Hanna, he sees Neil's shadow projected from the lights of a plane, and in a split second decision, Hanna turns his pistol and puts four rounds in Neil. As Neil lies there dying, Hanna approaches him, Neil says \"Told you I'm never going back (to prison)\". Neil offers his hand, and Hanna clutches it and waits with Neil as he dies.Chris Shiherlis is shot in the clavicle by Det. Casals during the shootout, he and Neil escape the scene in a stolen car after Neil fires several suppressive bursts on Hanna and a few other cops. Neil then takes Chris to a trusted doctor to get patched up. Chris insists on going to get his wife and child, but Neil tries to convince Chris that the police are anticipating that and will have a trap set up for him. Chris ignores this and goes for Charlene. She appears on a balcony to him but gives him a signal that it's a trap. So Chris plays it off as asking for directions to someone on the street. He is stopped by the police, but he has a fake I.D. and the car he drove hadn't been reported as stolen, so they let him go. He then drives off with his share of the money, alone.Michael Cheritto is separated from Neil and Chris during the shootout. As he is escaping he trips and falls into a fountain, allowing Hanna time to draw a bead on him. When Michael gets up he grabs a young girl near the fountain and uses her as a human shield while firing at the other cops, unable to notice Hanna behind him. When he turns, he barely has time to react before Hanna shoots him in the head, killing him instantly.Donald Breedan is hit by gunfire while driving the getaway car towards the roadblock. It appears he was shot in the head and dies at the scene.Trejo calls Neil shortly before the final bank heist was supposed to happen saying that the police were all over him and he couldn't shake them. He then says to Neil that the last thing he wanted to do was let him down. He wasn't present for the final bank heist, so Neil deduces that it was Trejo who ratted them out to the police. Neil goes into Trejo's house (likely with the intention of killing him) to find Trejo's wife beaten to death and Trejo also horribly injured, and barely alive. Neil asks Trejo why he betrayed them; Trejo reveals that they forced him to because they were holding his wife hostage (this can be viewed in a deleted scene). He tells Neil it was Waingro and Van Zant who were responsible before asking Neil to put him out of his misery. Neil obliges by shooting him.Nate, though not a thief, is a broker and friend of Neil's. Unless any of the ensuing chaos could be traced back to him, which it is implied it didn't, he was free and clear. Given that Nate is such a valuable connection with a lot of experience in the criminal world, he probably knew a million ways not to be implicated in these types of underworld deals.In other scripts it shows Vincent Hanna and 2 of his officers arrest Nate the Fence after he for the last time talked to Neil McCauley.Cesar Kelso, the mastermind of the bank heist. Neil buys the information to the bank from him.Charlene Shiherlis: See the question Because Shiherlis never showed up to be apprehended by the cops, would Charlene go to jail?The Crooks:Waingro, after learning that Neil and Chris escaped the bank robbery, he goes to hide out in a hotel under the name \"Jameson.\" Nate tells this to Neil, as Nate has a friend inside the LAPD who is staking out the hotel in case Neil makes a move on Waingro. Neil decides that he needs to settle the score with Waingro, so he infiltrates the hotel dressed as a security guard, bypasses all the police and security, breaks into Waingro's room and executes Waingro by shooting him twice in the chest and once in the head (a la the Mozambique Drill).Roger Van Zant: Neil goes to Van Zant's home, throws a patio chair through Van Zant's window while Van Zant is watching a hockey game, startling him. Neil aims his gun at Van Zandt and demands to know where Waingro is hiding. Roger replies \"How the hell would I know?\" so Neil shoots him three times in the chest.Hugh Benny: The cops find out that he is the one who ratted the bank heist to the police, so Vincent and his team storm Benny's apartment. When Benny tries to resist, Vincent shoves him through his balcony door and proceeds to interrogate him. So he was likely arrested unless Vincent agreed to let him go if he gave up all the players.Alan Marciano: Agrees to set Charlene up in order to have charges against him dropped. He follows through, so he was likely released.The CopsVincent Hanna: Catches his wife cheating on him, finds his step-daughter in his bath tub near-death due to her attemping suicide by cutting her wrists. Essentially his personal life has completely derailed, but by the end of the film he had caught or killed the criminals he was after, and seeing as how he was a career person more than a family person, he would likely get through it.Sgt. Drucker is last seen with Charlene, but we presume he continues working for Hanna.Schwartz is shot in the shoulder by Cheritto during the bank robbery while firing from beside an LACMTA bus. He gets patched up and stays in the Robbery/Homicide office while the team try to net Neil and Chris. Earlier scripts had Schwartz being the detective killed in the shootout instead of Bosko (Ted Levine's character).Bosko is part of the initial exchange of gunfire with Shiherlis during the bank robbery shootout. He is killed when Shiherlis shoots him in the neck.Casals stays in the robbery/homicide office with Schwartz except to help Vincent apprehend Hugh Benny."

            "First of all, nothing in the film suggests that the order of the \"types\" is anything but chronological: a Type 3 Screamer is simply developed later than a Type 2 and is not necessarily therefore more advanced. Although we can generally expect a trend toward more advanced capabilities in higher-numbered types, if the Screamers develop a type that e.g. imitates one of the rock bugs we see midway through the film, its \"type\" will presumably be whatever the next available integer is, whether it's more capable than previous types or not.However, the film does make clear that the trend is in fact toward increasing capabilities.The Type 1 Screamer is the one that burrows under the sand. There are at least two variants of the \"Type 1 Revised\": the one Hendricksson examines at the beginning of the film, and the reptile-like one encountered at NEB Headquarters an hour into the film. (The one that \"looks like an animal\" may be a third.) The Type 2 is said to be a \"wounded soldier\" (although it should be noted that the only reliable source of this information is Ross; the others turn out to be Screamers) and the Type 3 is revealed by the Screamers' own tag to be the David Edward Dearing model. Becker himself may or may not be a Type 2, and if he is one, he may be an evolved, advanced, \"revised\" version that is more capable than the original \"wounded soldier.\" It seems likely that Jessica is a Type 4, and there's no telling about the teddy bear in the final shot -- perhaps it's a Type 5, or pehaps it's a 4 and Jessica is a 5.",
            ". . . does Hendricksson expect to get there in an escape pod?We probably have to assume that a faster-than-light drive has been developed. (Certainly there must be faster-than-light communication, or Hendricksson would expect the message from Secretary Green to be at least eight and a half years old.) The escape pod may have such a drive itself or it may take Hendricksson to another vessel that has one.Another possibility is wormhole technology or discovery, where a stable wormhole between Earth and Sirius has been established, either by humans or by nature.",
            "Chuck Elbarak and Hendricksson have a conversation early in the film about Point Reyes, and the Screamer with Chuck's face appears to know about it. How?That's the Type 2 Screamer that posed as Becker. He has put himself back together. He takes faces by peeling them off of his victims. It's not impossible to think that Chuck was tortured for info before the Type 3 Davids killed everyone in the base.",
            "Who puts the teddy bear into the escape pod? The fact is that we don't know; the film never shows us explicitly. It may have been the second Jessica Screamer, the Screamer with Chuck's face, or another Screamer we don't see.The most likely explanation is that Hendrickson puts it in himself, not knowing that it was a screamer, as he is shown have brought it with him and is shown holding it before he goes down to the escape pod."

            "The \"Gluttony\" victim (Bob Mack) was an unnamed obese man who was forced to eat until his stomach bursts, killing him. The \"Greed\" victim was Eli Gould (Gene Borkan), a wealthy lawyer who had 'Sloth' victim Victor acquitted of child molestation. He was purposely bled to death by being forced at gunpoint to sacrifice a pound of his own flesh from his lower abdomen. The \"Sloth\" victim was Victor (Michael Reid MacKay), a notorious paedophile. He was tied to his bed for an entire year, kept at the brink of survival only through the judicious usage of intravenous drugs and medications, the experience of which causes him untold physical anguish and renders him completely insane. He's taken to a local hospital with a chewed up tongue, vegetated brain, disintegrated and rotted skeletal body but we don't hear about him finally dying in the movie. Incidentally, he once escaped conviction for raping a minor due to the successful efforts of his lawyer, Eli Gould. The \"Lust\" victim was a prostitute (Cat Mueller) who was raped and killed by a man forced at gunpoint to use a strap-on dildo with blade attachment. The \"Pride\" victim was a model (Heidi Schanz) whose nose was cut off, disfiguring her. She was provided with a telephone to call an ambulance, hence living life disfigured and scarred, and sleeping pills to commit suicide and escape the life of disfigurement. She ostensibly chooses the latter option. Envy and Wrath are not revealed until the very end of the movie. The \"Envy\" victim is the story's criminal, John Doe (Kevin Spacey). He wanted a normal family life like Mills had; when Tracy Mills (Gwyneth Paltrow) refused to go along with him, he killed her, making her a victim of Envy, her death off-screen and her unseen, decapitated head mailed to Mills and Somerset in the desert. Detective Mills is \"Wrath\"; when John Doe reveals what he has done to Tracy, Mills becomes enraged and shoots John Doe, making him the fatality of the sin Wrath.",
            "John Doe mentions to Mills and Somerset that Tracy begged him for her life and for the life of the unborn child inside her. In short; Tracy told John Doe she was pregnant.",
            "It was Tracy's severed head. John Doe kills her, fulfilling the sin of envy because he envied Det. Mills' \"simple\" life. Doe hoped that in turn Mills would then kill him, fulfilling the final sin, wrath (which also makes sure John is punished by death for his sin). Mills is technically not punished by death for his sin, but he is obviously left a broken man (which is probably the life he is \"allowed to live\", to which John Doe was referring in the car). Though he's not killed like Doe's other victims, Mills is still a victim because of the long-term psychological effects of the ordeal.",
            "John Doe leads Mills and Somerset out into the middle of nowhere, assuring them that they will be impressed by what they find. Along the way, John defends his actions by saying that he was chosen to turn each sin against the sinner. Mills taunts him by saying that he has delusions of grandeur, but Somerset says very little. Eventually, John announces that they have reached the spot, and the car pulls over near some high-tension electrical wires. They walk back along the road for a few yards until Somerset notices a white van approaching them. While Mills holds John at gunpoint, Somerset meets the van. The driver claims that he was just delivering a package for Detective David Mills. Somerset opens the package and steps back in horror. Meanwhile, John is telling Mills how much he admires him and envies the life he has made for himself, so much that he went to Mills' home that morning and tried to play husband with Tracy. But Tracy wouldn't play along, so he took a souvenir-Tracy's head. John further explains how Tracy begged for her life and the life of the child inside her then realizes that Mills didn't even know she was pregnant. Somerset tries to get Mills to hand over his gun, but Mills goes crazy and shoots John six times. In the final scene, Mills is seated in the back seat of a squad car. As the car drives away, Somerset says in a voiceover, \"Ernest Hemingway once wrote, 'The world is a fine place and worth fighting for.' I agree with the second part.\"",
            "It may differ from victim to victim, but a significant amount of planning for at least two victims may be assumed. Victor, the third victim (Sloth), was tied to his bed for exactly a year; keeping a person alive and hidden for that amount of time implies an enormous amount of preparation as well as dedication. This suggests that John Doe already selected Victor and began planning his entire work well before he captured him. Doe probably also had his eye on Eli Gould, the second victim (Greed), because he was the one who kept Victor out of jail. These are the only two victims with a clear connection to each other, as the other 3 victims do not appear to be connected. It is possible that Victor and Eli Gould were among the first victims targeted, even though they were not the first two to be found. Indeed, in John's home, several newspaper clippings can be seen on a cupboard that describe Eli Gould defending Victor and getting him an acquittal, so this may have been how John Doe selected them.Which brings us to the seventh victim. It is reasonable to assume that Mills was selected \"on the spot\". He was recently transfered to homicide, and John Doe could not have known beforehand that Mills would be one of the detectives working on the case. Doe meets up with Mills at the scene of the Sloth murder, and personally experiences Mills' violent temper which would make him the ideal candidate; later, Doe has the opportunity to kill Mills in the alley, but doesn't, probably to preserve him for becoming the seventh victim. It is unknown if Doe had originally intended another person as the Wrath victim before he met Mills, and decided Mills would be the perfect candidate (he can be heard mentioning over the phone that he will be readjusting his schedule); but it makes sense that he intended the seventh victim to be an officer anyway: an officer of the law driven to the point of killing an unarmed suspect would attract a lot of (media) attention, and would ensure that his work would be discussed for years to come. During their conversation when Doe calls his apartment and talks to Mills, he says \"I'm moving up my timetable in light of today's little... setback\" indicating that he likely altered his plans to include Mills.It is more difficult to determine when the other victims were selected. There is a picture of the fourth victim (Lust) in John's house, which may imply he had his eye on her some time, but without an indication of when it was taken, there is no sure way to tell. When John says that he has to readjust his schedule, it may just mean that he is changing the location of the murders, or his \"headquarters\", not the victims per se. He had a special murder weapon created for the Lust victim, and the man he forced to use it on the victim seemed to be a completely random guy, but this does not exclude the possibility that the victim was carefully selected long before that. The same goes for the first (Gluttony) and fifth victim (Pride): they could have been selected shortly before, but given John's meticulous preparations, it is not unthinkable that he had them targeted for some time. Also, John mentions about the Pride victim that she was \"so ugly on the inside (that) she couldn't bear to go on living if she couldn't be beautiful on the outside\", implying that he knew her personally, and she wasn't selected shortly before."

Jose may also believe that Cole will have to use the gun to defend himself or others if things go wrong. Ultimately, Cole uses the gun to try and stop the release of the virus, but his efforts are ultimately unsuccessful.",
            "The virus that James Cole is trying to prevent is a deadly disease that has wiped out most of humanity. The virus is known as the \"Kalavirus,\" and it is believed to have been released by a group known as the Army of the Twelve Monkeys.",

In both, the hero meets a woman in the past with whom he falls in love, and the hero decides he wants to stay in the past with her. And in both, the hero is instead killed at an airport in front of the younger self of the hero, who is there to watch planes. But the films are markedly different. The two films differ in the type of catastrophe that puts humanity in peril. Also, in La jet\u00e9e, the hero travels into the future as well as the past. But the most important difference is that La jet\u00e9e is a 26-minute-long narrated story told over a series of black and white photographs, while Twelve Monkeys is an action movie. Twelve Monkeys' greater length allows for a much more detailed treatment of the subject matter.",

At the end of the film, Cole identifies the carrier of the virus, and although Cole himself dies, his information allowed one of the scientists to go to the past from the future, and obtain a sample of the virus, thereby making the hope for an eventual cure possible. Note that the female scientist is clearly the same age in the modern setting as she is in the future scenes, ruling out the notion that her younger self just happens to have been on the plane with the carrier. It is strongly implied that the scientists from the future planned Cole's death because he refused to return to his own time, and they could not allow him to disturb the past any further. They send Jose (Jon Seda) through time to give Cole an ancient gun and instructions to complete his mission. They might have intended that Cole try to use the gun in a(n) (futile) attempt to kill the carrier of the virus. The scientists probably knew it would not work and would cause security personnel to neutralize him, while the female scientist herself made sure the mission was completed.",
            "There are roughly two major schools of thought on the subject of time travel in (science) fiction. One is that a timeline is \"flexible\" and can be changed. When a certain outcome is undesirable, one needs to travel back to a point in the past, and change whatever caused the undesirable outcome to happen. For instance, in order to save your mother from being run over by a car, you travel back in time so that you can push her out of the car's way and save her life. Most popular movies about time-travel adhere to this principle (e.g. Back to the Future (1985), Donnie Darko (2001), The Butterfly Effect (2004), and Deja Vu (2006)).Another theory is that the timeline is \"fixed\" and can't be changed. The present is already the result of the past plus all attempts to try and manipulate the present. This implies that whatever you try to prevent by traveling back in time will be unsuccessful, or, worse, instrumental in causing whatever you tried to prevent. In case of the mother example, according to this theory, you can travel back in time to a moment before she was hit, but any action you might take will not be successful in saving her. Possible scenarios are that you don't make it in time for some reason: perhaps in your hurry, you are hit by a car yourself, or you could shout at her to watch out for the car, thereby distracting her from the traffic, and thus causing her death. Movies following this principle are Sphere (1998), Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004), The Time Machine (1960), and Twelve Monkeys.Cole says that the future can't be changed, which proves to be true. Throughout the movie we see and hear about things that are said to happen in the future, and they all inevitably happen. Of course, the main event is that the global virus infection occurs. Cole's mission is not to prevent it, because the scientists know he can't; the very fact that the infection happened is evidence that it could not be prevented anyway. Furthermore, by traveling back into the past, Cole sets in motion a chain of events that lead to the very future he comes from, e.g. the mysterious recording by Kathryn to the future, in which she identifies the Army of the Twelve Monkeys as the source of the virus. Cole and the scientists hear the recording and Cole is sent back in time to investigate; however, because of Cole's interactions with Kathryn Railly, he causes Kathryn to make this recording. In essence, the events that trigger him to travel through time actually cause them, which is known as a time paradox.The fact that the future is set does not prevent Cole from trying to change it anyway. It is in his nature to try, simply because he does not know the exact details of what caused that particular future to happen and what his failure in trying was. For instance, it is known in the future that there was an outbreak of a virus, but not who or what started it. After the Army of the Twelve Monkeys appeared to be a dead end, Cole and Kathryn identify the real perpetrator at the airport, and try to stop him. This ends in Cole's death, which is witnessed by the young Cole, explaining the strange dreams he always had. It had never occurred to the young Cole that he actually saw himself dying, so the adult Cole never knew what fate would await him if he would try to prevent the virus outbreak.",
            "Because she has to maintain the timeline, and the future can't be changed. If she had, then a grandfather paradox would occur, where the result of a time journey would prevent the time travel itself from occurring: if the scientist were to stop Dr. Peters from releasing the virus in all the other cities, the virus outbreak would be restricted to the United States, and there would (probably) not be a global outbreak. In that case, there would be no need to send anyone back to the past, and in turn this would mean that there would be no one to stop the outbreak from occurring. This would, again, cause a global virus outbreak, which would prompt the scientists again to travel backwards in time, and so on. In short, the world would get stuck in a cause-and-effect loop. One way to get out of this is to let the future run its course. The scientist ensures that she returns to the future that she left behind, with the cure needed to get the remainder of mankind back to the surface of the Earth.\nIn fact, the holder of the virus infects the airport security guard while he is examining the vials. The virus is held directly under his nose, which implies it infects him with it."

        ],
        "answers": [
            "Technically S\u00f6ze didn't *have* to kill any of them, as none of the group knew his true identity. However the reasons may be as follows; first, Fenster tried to flee., so he had to be killed to show the others what would happen if they tried to run as well. Hockney, Keaton and McManus were likely killed so that they wouldn't be able to tell different stories of the events that happened. If Verbal is the only survivor, he could spin the narrative any way he saw fit. Also, because he worked so closely with the group, S\u00f6ze may have felt they had seen too much as it was. Not to mention, they had all stolen from S\u00f6ze, which is why they were brought together in the first place. While \"Kobayoshi\" explained that because they didn't know they stole from S\u00f6ze is the only reason they weren't killed, that doesn't mean they would be spared forever.",
            "There was no cocaine. When Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite) blackmailed the five men, he said that it was their job to get on the ship and destroy the cocaine on board. S\u00f6ze was using them as a diversion. While they were killing the other men on the ship and looking for the drugs, S\u00f6ze sneaked onto the ship and killed Arturo (Castulo Guerra). Arturo was the one man who could positively identify him, so S\u00f6ze needed him dead.",
            "Yes, there are some. One is Verbal's relative position on the night of the attack. He is hiding behind a stack of material on the dock. When Hockney is killed, Verbal would have been the closest person to him. In his testimony, shown in flashback, Verbal supposedly takes cover behind some large spools of rope on the dock as he observes Soze on the boat. However, when the camera zooms in on this area from the opposite side after the explosion, no one is seen peering through the ropes.In the opening scene, we see Keyser S\u00f6ze look at a gold pocket watch and produce a gold cigarette lighter. Later, in the scene where the gang threatens Kobayashi, we see Verbal wearing a similar watch. He also collects this watch, along with a gold cigarette lighter, as he leaves the police station, despite having earlier demonstrated his inability to use a similar lighter during his questioning.In the interrogation, Verbal comments that when he gets dehydrated his urine becomes thick and lumpy due to a kidney condition. In the opening scene when Keyser S\u00f6ze urinates on the fire, his urine is thick and lumpy.When agent Kujan begins to suggest that Keaton might be the one behind the hit on the docks, Verbal can be seen starting to smile. When Kujan comes around from behind Verbal and looks him in the face, the smile disappears, and Verbal continues to pretend loyalty to Keaton. During the interrogation throughout the movie, although it is easy to miss upon a first viewing, Verbal is seen glancing for a second or two away from Kujan or over Kujan's shoulder at the wall behind him in full view of wanted posters and advertisement flyers of names as Verbal is clearly making up the names of the mysterious associates and contacts such as \"Redfoot\" and \"Kobayashi\" when Kujan's questioning becomes more intense as it revealed that Verbal Kint is making up (on the spur-of-the-moment) aliases of his co-conspirators as he goes along.S\u00f6ze is seen wearing a black fedora and trench coat on the boat. These are both seen hanging in Arturo Marquez's cabin. So it would make sense that Verbal snuck on to the ship, took the coat and hat after killing Arturo in order to finish off Keaton and McManus.Keyser S\u00f6ze is described by Verbal as being of mixed Turkish/German heritage. \"S\u00f6ze\" is Turkish for \"talks too much\", or \"verbal\". \"Keyser\" sounds like the German word \"Kaiser\", meaning \"emperor\", while \"Kint\" sounds like \"king.\" Director Bryan Singer has referred to the name as essentially meaning \"The king that talks too much.\"Finally, one might simply recognize that when S\u00f6ze whispers, \"How ya doin' Keaton?\", at the start of the film, the voice is that of Verbal/Kevin Spacey. After being thrown on the ground Verbal slips, \"I did kill Keaton,\" though Kujan is shouting too loud to hear, and Verbal is able to correct himself by saying \"I did see Keaton get shot.\" Also, when they are listening to the men before the attack on the boat Keaton speculates that they are speaking Russian, Verbal correctly identifies the language as Hungarian, something Soze would obviously know.",
            "Yes. At the end of the movie, US Customs agent Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) concludes that Keyser S\u00f6ze must be Dean Keaton. In an ironic twist, however, S\u00f6ze actually turns out to be Verbal Kint.",
            "Yes and no. Verbal tells Kujan the story as if he was simply Verbal Kint and not Keyser S\u00f6ze. Verbal tells Kujan that it was his plan to rob the corrupt police officers without killing anybody. Then they fenced the goods to Redfoot, who then offered them the next job of robbing Saul Berg, which was set up by Kobayashi, etc. etc., which finally led to the events at the end of the film, leaving Verbal the only survivor. When pushed by Kujan, Verbal is adamant that Dean Keaton was his friend and that he wasn't the mastermind behind all the events. When pushed harder by Kujan and given all the facts, Verbal breaks down and admits that they all followed Keaton from the beginning, and that he planned and executed everything. At the very least, the names of those involved, such as Redfoot and Kobayashi, were clearly invented by Verbal on the spot, and his descriptions of where he was when the others got killed during the attack on the boat all appear to be untrue.However, we see that the person who he referred to as \"Kobayashi\" was real, as he picks Verbal up at the end. So it's likely that most of the events that happened were true, but certain aspects may have been fabricated or several of the names changed in order to keep Kujan from being able to trace anyone who had actually been involved with Verbal, thus preserving S\u00f6ze's identity. For example, the incident when \"Kobayashi\" meets with the five of them, gives them their police files, and gives them the assignment of robbing the ship of the supposed cocaine and money, was likely true. In addition, the robbery of Saul Berg and the New York's Finest Taxi Service, and the fact that all five men were rounded up by the police for a lineup, were certainly true, as such facts could be easily confirmed with a few calls to the LAPD and the NYPD. It should also be noted that one of the keys to lying well is to stick as closely to the truth as possible. In this case, it's likely that many of the broad outlines of the story which Verbal told are true.",
            "At the end of Kujan's interrogation of Verbal Kint, Kujan looks over the details strewn across the bulletin board, recognizing most of the names from Verbal's account of the events, just as an artist's depiction of Keyser S\u00f6ze makes its way to the police station via fax. It is Verbal Kint. As Verbal walks down the street, his leg straightens out, his fingers uncrimp, and he lights a cigarette. Kujan runs from the building in an attempt to catch Verbal, but the man called \"Kobayashi\" has picked him up. Keyser S\u00f6ze has once again disappeared.",
            "It's entirely plausible that all the evidence that pointed to Verbal Kint being Keyser S\u00f6ze was red herrings, and someone else could have been the mythical crime lord. For example, Verbal doesn't look old enough to have been married with children. However, it wouldn't be too shocking if he was simply Keyser Soze's son continuing the family tradition. The story about Soze shooting his children is true, but Verbal survived by hiding when the thugs came in. In fact, Kobayashi could reasonably have been Keyser Soze. He is clearly in his late 50s or early 60s, making a larger window for him to become one of the most powerful criminals in the world. He's less amazingly steeped in American culture, vernacular and geography for a Turkish crime lord compared to Verbal, he never gets directly involved in his crimes, let alone enters a police station and gives clues that could ruin a cherished identity, preferring instead to have those jobs be carried out by middlemen. Under this theory, Verbal is a conman who is Keyser's infiltrator who helps him stay on top, and also even plays the part of Keyser sometimes, such as on the boat, while \"Kobayashi\" remains completely behind the scenes and his face remains a secret. While not the intended theory, it is plausible.",
            "More or less. Soze has wrought revenge on those who stole from him, wiped out the opposition and killed the one witness who could identify him. However, the police now have his photograph, fingerprints and DNA and another witness (the surviving Hungarian gangster) who can implicate him. They can also backtrack through the various aspects of the story, checking up on Edie Finnegan's client list, the owners of the hijacked gun truck etc to generate possible leads on Soze's organisation. However, Soze/Verbal Kint will likely go into hiding, plus with his underworld connections, he will likely stay hidden or more likely re-surface again later, somewhere with a different alias and maybe a different face should he likely change his appearance through plastic surgery, but this is all speculation."

Knowing that he was drugged, Kruger feared that he might reveal her whereabouts. DeGuerin was also probably well aware that Kruger had been trained to withstand extreme amounts of pain so he knew that torturing him to get Lee's location would be pointless. Therefore, drugging and tricking him into paging Lee was the best option.",

Deguerin privately assures Harper that their case will never reach trial because all they have is Lee's testimony against them. Meanwhile, Kruger and Lee get into a van and prepare to drive away. Suddenly, in front of everyone's eyes, the van explodes. Not seen by anyone is a hand closing a sewer grating under the van. Deguerin and Harper drive away in their limo, congratulating each other on arranging Lee's timely death, until they realize that neither of them had anything to do with it. Suddenly, the limo stops, the door locks close automatically, and the chauffeur, actually Johnny Casteleone in disguise, walks away from the car. The limo phone rings, and Kruger's voice says, \"You've just been erased.\" Kruger can be seen standing near the road as Deguerin and Harper realize that they're parked on railroad tracks and that a train is rapidly approaching them. They struggle to no avail to unlock the limo doors and break the windows, but the train crashes into them and the limo goes up in flames.

(3) The mercenary who was holding Alison hostage revealed that he was working with Deguerin right before Deguerin shot him (he lowered his gun and said \"you're early\"), therefore he had to kill Alison to keep her quiet."

The place was either Shep's apartment that Carl was staying at while in town, or Shep had contacted Carl off screen to demand they meet. The big question is, if Shep knew Carl, why did he lie to Jerry? We can only speculate, but it's possible that Shep referred Grimsrud to Jerry and Grimsrud decided to bring Carl in on it. So Shep just pretended to not know him in order to avoid any blame. Shep was already on probation, and if it is discovered he played a role in arranging the kidnapping (i.e. setting up the meeting between Jerry, Carl, and Gaear) he would almost certainly go back to prison.",

            "Grimsrud killed Showalter for two likely reasons:1) Showalter refused to pay Grimsrud for half the car's value and proceeded to threaten him and insult him.2) Grimsrud always planned to kill Showalter to keep all the money for himself.As to why Grimsrud put Showalter in the wood chipper, this would be a fast and efficient way to dispose of the body and make identification impossible.",
            "It's never fully explained in the movie, but there are subtle hints that the scene did have a significant role in the plot; Mike's fragile emotional state obviously startles Marge. After her friend informs her about Mike's problems and the fact that he was never married to Linda as he said, you can see that she becomes very sad and concerned about him. This is most evident in the scene where she is eating Hardee's in her car. As she is thinking about this, her mind apparently wanders off into other areas including the case she is working on. At the very end of that scene, you can see a slight but noticeable expression on her face that indicates a light bulb just went off in her head. This is because she has connected Mike's frantic behavior with the similar, though much less severe, behavior by Jerry in her first meeting with him. You will recall that Jerry displayed a certain amount of nervousness that would have illustrated to someone looking closely that he was a bit panicked (for example, pausing and remarking about Brainerd instead of answering her question about whether a vehicle had been stolen). Marge apparently didn't notice it at the time but after thinking about her encounter with Mike she is then able to connect the dots. Soon after, she goes back to speak with Jerry again. It is also thought that Marge, although being an experienced police officer, realizes she may not always know when she is being lied to. After discovering that everything Mike said to her was a lie, she questions her police work and thinks that maybe Jerry was lying to her as well. This is why she goes back to question Jerry again.",
            "Let's do a little character evaluation on Jerry:1. Jerry is shown to be spineless, inept and incompetent in pretty much everything he tries, a hapless loser who tries but just can't get anything done right. The Coen Brothers have described Jerry as an \"amateur criminal\". This is first evidenced in the scene where Jerry is finalizing a sale for a new car to a couple and the man is infuriated that Jerry added the $500 TruCoat onto the price of $19,500 and charged the customer for it even though the man specifically stated he didn't want it. Instead of Jerry conceding and taking the cost off the man's bill, he says he'd go talk to his boss about it. However seeing as Jerry is the boss (he later tells Marge that he is the sales manager), we see that he steps into the break-room to talk to a co-worker to make it seem like he just spoke to \"his boss\". When he comes back, Jerry says he could get $100 knocked off the cost of the TruCoat, infuriating his customer even further.2. We also see that Jerry's father-in-law Wade, who owns the car dealership Jerry works at, pretty much despises him and makes little effort to hide it. Wade does not like Jerry because he is aware of Jerry's craftiness or of the thought that Jerry may have married his daughter, Jean, just because he is wealthy, which is later shown that with the exception of his and Jean's son, Scott, Jerry shows little or no concern or affection for both his father-in-law or his own wife.3. We can assume Jerry was likely involved in some sort of business scheme or schemes where he lost a lot of money, because he apparently didn't know what he was himself getting into. It is speculated that sometime before the events in the film, he created fake invoices for vehicles he \"sold\" at the dealership even though they didn't actually exist.4. Jerry sent the sold invoices along with an insurance loan request off to the dealership finance company GMAC by using a batch of non-existent dealership vehicles as collateral with illegible VIN numbers... somehow hoping they wouldn't notice. The finance company, GMAC, calls Jerry at least twice on-camera to confront him about the accounting irregularities and wanted the VIN numbers as evidence that the vehicles he is using for collateral exist or else they would pull the loans on the vehicles which total $320,000. The reasons for Jerry doing this remain unknown. Speculation from various viewers say that Jerry probably embezzled money from the dealership bank accounts and then borrowed the money from GMAC to replace the money he stole. Another speculation is that Jerry wanted the $320,000 loan to pay off other creditors he owes money to, or that he either spent or gambled the $320,000 loan away for personal use (though there is nothing in the film to suggest that Jerry has a gambling problem). The mostly likely reason is that Jerry floated the loan and used the embezzled money to provide his family with modest and fancy living accommodations; the house along with the furniture, household items, etc.5. Clearly, Jerry knew that this plan only had a limited run so, through the association of a mechanic employee and ex-convict, Shep Proudfoot, Jerry meets and hires Grimsrud and Showalter to kidnap his wife and demand a ransom of $80,000 from Jerry's father-in-law which Jerry will split with the kidnappers so Jerry could show as proof of car sales for GMAC. Jerry tries to call off the kidnapping at one point because he thinks that a real estate deal he brings to Wade's attention will get him out of the bind he is in financially. But Wade takes the deal solely for himself and offers Jerry a measly finder's fee. Jerry is too late to call off the kidnapping anyway and so Jerry tells Wade that the ransom is $1,000,000 (so that Jerry can use $320,000 of it to pay back GMAC when they demand their money back, and probably to spend the rest for personal use as well as give Showalter and Grimsrud their $40,000).6. Through a course of events, which includes Grimsrud and Showalter shooting and killing a Minnesota State Police trooper who pulled them over for not having temporary vehicle tags on their car (followed by Grimsrud chasing down and shooting two passing motorists who see Showalter moving the trooper's body off the road), Showalter calls Jerry and says he wants the entire $80,000 ransom, leaving Jerry with nothing. Of course everyone knows that Jerry is in no position to negotiate, threaten or demand anything from Showalter and Grimsrud. Being inept and having poorly thought out of this kidnapping plan, Jerry doesn't have anything on the kidnappers to use for leverage, but they have everything on Jerry, as Grimsrud and Showalter know that Jerry personally met and hired them to kidnap his wife (at his own house) and if the police should capture them first, they can always rat on Jerry by claiming that he was the mastermind of the whole thing; Grimsrud probably does so after being arrested. At one point, Showalter even threatens to kill Jerry and his family if he fails to follow his instructions for the payout. Jerry knows that he has no choice but to agree to any demands the kidnappers threaten him with.7. Once again, the plan backfires on Jerry because his father-in-law knows how unreliable Jerry is and doesn't trust him with the ransom money (rightfully so) and insists on going to the exchange himself. Jerry, being spineless and afraid of his father-in-law, does not insist on going in his place or even going with him, even though he also knows that Showalter is also infuriated at Jerry and the kind of people he's dealing with. For some reason, Jerry decides to go to the meeting anyway and he finds Wade's body, which he puts in his car trunk (and possibly he knows that Wade is dead as he's entering the parking garage, given that he passes a bloodied Carl driving out). After this turn of events, Jerry goes back into work as if everything was hunky-dory until Marge goes back to interview him again. Jerry panics and flees the scene. He is eventually apprehended at a motel in North Dakota. As a final irony, Jerry, being incompetent to the end, uses the same \"Jerry Anderson\" alias that he uses when checking into the Fargo, North Dakota inn where he first meets Grimsrud and Showalter, likely another clue that enables the police to easily track him down.",
            "Carl Showalter intended to keep the rest of the money for himself which is precisely why he buried it. The shots showing the fence on the left and right show that he did not have any type of identifying marker to find the money again. This is why he sticks the windshield ice scraper into the ground. Carl's plan was to hide the money, return with the $80,000 to split evenly, then to take the car and return to the spot where he buried it to reclaim the remaining $920,000 giving him a grand total of $960,000 and Grimsrud would have never been any the wiser.",
            "At the end of the film, Showalter now has $1,000,000. Of course, instead of telling Grimsrud about this, he takes out $80,000 in order to bring to Grimsrud to split with him, as Grimsrud is only expecting a cut of $40,000. As far as Grimsrud knows, Showalter is making good on their arrangement. Showalter says he's taking the car they took for the job and that Grimsrud could have his old truck and they must part ways. Grimsrud says they need to split the car by Showalter paying Grimsrud for half the car's value if he wants the car for himself. Showalter, infuriated with the notion, reminds Grimsrud that he took a bullet in the face picking up the ransom and that he's been doing all the driving between Brainerd & Minneapolis (on almost no sleep), and threatens Grimsrud by reminding him that he still has a gun. This prompts Grimsrud to run outside and kill Showalter with an axe and dispose of his body in a wood chipper, leaving him with all $80,000.Many people would wonder why would Showalter bother arguing with Grimsrud about paying him out of his cut when he's got another $920,000 buried in the snow to pick up later that Grimsrud would never know about. Basically what it comes down to is a clear and simple case of greed. Showalter doesn't want to give any more money to Grimsrud than the agreed upon amount because he feels he did all the work and took a bullet across the face for his troubles, while Grimsrud simply looked after Jerry's wife. In the end, Grimsrud couldn't even do that and decided to kill her. Further, Grimsrud wanted a bigger cut by making a case of the new car that Jerry gave them and wanted Showalter to pay for half the car's value. While Grimsrud barely speaks throughout the film, it's obvious that he's a psychopath and has no qualms about killing anyone so it's possible that he was planning on killing Showalter anyway when he arrived back at the cabin just to steal his half of the $80,000. However, Grimsrud's decision to kill Showalter might have been only a spur-of-the-moment thing because Grimsrud didn't seem intent on killing Showalter until after Showalter started threatening him.Keep in mind as well that both Grimsrud and Showalter are petty criminals, and that their status as such may be the result of them viewing the world from a perspective that differs from that of the average person, as well as an inflated sense of entitlement and tendency to attach an out-sized significance to the kind of affront that the average person would find irritating but nonetheless dismiss relatively quickly (in other words, an inability to \"keep things in perspective\"). There are multiple, even more absurd examples in the film this mindset, including in the opening scene during the discussion about whether the agreed-on meeting time in the bar had been 7:30 or 8:30, Showalter's outrage over the $4 charge to exit the airport parking lot (and apparent need to \"get even\" with the lot cashier by insulting him), and so on. Showalter also yells at Grimsrud about doing all the driving; the distance from Brainerd to Minneapolis alone is a minimum of 127 miles & two hours, making it a four hour roundtrip. Grimsrud had refused to do any of the driving, leaving Showalter to do it and be awake for at least 36 hours, which will make anyone short on temper. Grimsrud had also refused to drive from Fargo to Brainerd, which is another 140 mile drive and about two and a half hours.",
            "It's not known for certain, but it appears he either split her head open on the side of the countertop, or possibly slashed her throat and the blood seen on the counter is arterial spray. He could even have shot her in the head at point-blank range with the pistol he'd used to kill the trooper, although Showalter had the pistol at the time. Some viewers thought that Grimsrud killed her by sticking her head in the oven because the oven door was open. But the oven was turned on and the door was open simply to give off heat to try and warm up the cabin.",

However in the first season of the TV series Fargo (2014) (2014-) on FX, it's revealed that some days later after the events in the feature film, a down on his luck businessman, Stavros Milos, pulled over to the side of the road in the middle of a nervous breakdown to pray to God for help. He looks towards the fence and sees the ice scraper buried in the snow. He finds the money (containing $920,000 in cash) and uses it to invest in a supermarket chain, which makes him a millionaire. He credits his finding the money a miracle from God."

            "At Ophelia's funeral,  Hamlet informs everyone that he did indeed love her, however, being as tormented as he is throughout the play, he was unable to express his love for her in any normal way.Another point of view:\"Hamlet, when he was himself, loved Ophelia. But then he erased himself from his own brain and there in the book and volume of his brain he wrote his warllike father's commandment (the voice of Denmark, sent from Hell to speak of horrors, to breathe contagion, unfolding the secrets of his prison-house that he was forbid to tell to mortal ears). Hamlet was from himself taken away.Hamlet did not want to chain Ophelia to the monster he had become. He did not want to make her, like his mother, imperial jointress to this warlike state and a breeder of sinners - sinners like his warlike father, his murderous uncle, and his own anguished and divided self.\"For more details, please see http://www.thyorisons.com/#Music_Vows - The Honey of His Music Vows",
            "Yes, he does. Every word. It may seem to casual viewers, though, that some lines are omitted, because Branagh transposes them to a different moment in the play. For instance, Hamlet's first words to the Ghost - \"Angels and ministers of grace defend us! Be thou a spirit of health, or goblin damned, bring with thee airs from Heaven or blasts from Hell, be thy intents wicked or charitable, thou comest in such a questionable shape that I will speak to thee\", etc. , meant to be spoken just before the Ghost beckons him to follow, are switched to a few moments after that, during which he is shown running through the forest after the Ghost. As he runs, we hear Hamlet's words in voiceover, then he stops and says \"Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak. I'll go no further\", and the Ghost speaks for the first time.\nAnd at the very beginning of the film's second half, we hear Claudius (Derek Jacobi) in voiceover saying \"O Gertrude, Gertrude, when sorrows come they come not single spies but in batallions\" -lines that he normally says after  we have seen Ophelia insane, not before.  Claudius's prayer scene is also transposed to just after Hamlet's soliloquy \" 'Tis now the very witching time of night\", when in the play it occurs several lines before that."

It was considered daring because it required Steve, along with David, to fly and dock the Roswell craft in the mothership approaching Area 51, download the virus, plant a nuclear bomb with a 30-second time delay, and escape from the mothership before the explosion occurred.",

        "answers": [
            "Jim Phelps did it to frame Ethan",
            "Jim brought it with him. As he was likely communicating with Max while setting up his final ruse at the start of the film. However, he likely left it in the safe house because he no longer needed it and didn't think about it being stamped or that anyone would trace it back to him.The above explanation is not satisfying though. It's not likely that Jim used the bible in his communication with Max, because as Max mentions to Ethan, the real \"Job\" (= Jim) didn't quote verses from the Bible in his messages. It's more likely that Jim was indeed a religious (but flawed) man, and that he was personally using the Bible to find strength and motivation in order to get through with his criminal plans. Jim felt that he was betrayed and abandoned by the company, by society, by the world; as if he were a modern-day Job. So first he does some preparatory work (make first contact with Max, arrange things with Krieger) in Chicago, and that's when he finds the bible in the Drake Hotel. Then he brings the bible with him to Prague, for what he thinks is the last part of his plan. Also note that in the final scenes on the train, Jim does quote from the Bible.Moreover, the bible was not found in the safe house in London; Ethan finds it in the safe house in *Prague* . That's the safe house that Ethan returned to after the botched mission (we can see Ethan put the chair back upright, the same chair that Jim had knocked over when he was leaving the house and going for the bridge). After using the bible to seek contact with Max via the many \"Book of Job\" usenet groups, Ethan and Claire bring it with them, first to Langley and then to London. Jim has trouble following Ethan all the way to London, as Ethan wasn't sharing details of his plan in advance, neither with Claire nor with the rest of the team; so Jim can't have put the bible into the London safe house anyway.",
            "Yes. When Jim meets with Ethan to explain his version of what happened, Ethan already figured out that Jim was a traitor. As they mentioned each team member getting killed, Ethan pictured how Jim would have accomplished this. With Jack's death, it meant Jim overrode the controls to the elevator.",
            "Kittridge, believing Ethan to be a mole in the IMF, tells his team to figure out how to hurt Ethan and lure him out. They do this by tracking down his closest living family - his mother and uncle - and having them arrested on phony charges of running an international drug ring.After the news is broadcast, Ethan calls Kittridge, who tells Ethan that the charges against his family would be dropped if he turned himself in. Kittridge knew Ethan realize that he was behind the phony arrests and hoped to use the phone call to pinpoint Ethan's location.As for why the news would be broadcast on TV in London, it's quite simple: The apparent bust of two international drug crimelords would be major global news. Add in that they appear to be just a couple of simple Wisconsin nobodies, and the irony of that would add to the news value, making it extremely plausible for a major network like Sky to broadcast it as part of its world news coverage.",
            "They don't. Ethan sends Kittridge a watch and tickets to the TGV train. In the train, once Jim has revealed himself, Ethan puts on his glasses with a video feed connected to the watch. Kittridge gets notified and sees Jim alive on the watch's display, which is enough for him to put the pieces together and conclude that it's Jim who is the real traitor.",
            "Because he felt that after years and years of risking his life he deserved more than his measly government salary. Essentially felt that he was underappreciated.Think of how many times Ethan has been betrayed and disavowed throughout the series of films. Most people would likely be tempted to sell out after that. Ethan is simply more interested in doing the right thing.",
            "As shown in the film, he fired a gun (with blanks) towards the camera in his glasses. He then looks up to the sky while he discards the gun and gloves over the bridge. Jim then picks up a sponge soaked in fake blood off the railing and smears himself with it, before tossing the sponge over as well. Jim then looks down at his stomach, giving the illusion he's been shot.",
            "No. Because after Ethan tricks Krieger in to giving back the NOC list, Claire apologised for Krieger saying that adding him to the team was \"her call\". So Ethan hired Luther and Claire suggested Krieger. Because Claire was also working with Jim.",
            "The code \"Job 314\" led Ethan to look at the Bible passage Job 3:14. Later in the movie, Ethan Hunt sees that the Bible was from the Drake Hotel in Chicago. Ethan deduced that Jim Phelps brought the Bible with him to Prague-when the team first meets in Prague they jokingly tease Jim about being allowed to stay in the Drake in Chicago, which is a very high-end and exclusive hotel there. Ethan might have concluded that there was no reason Jim would bring a Bible with him (Jim not being a religious man) unless it was meant to help him contact Max."

            "Most likely. Paxton is an FBI agent and would likely be able to tell that Goodspeed was fabricating Mason's fate. Having followed the whole ordeal from the beginning, knowing that the mission wouldn't have been a success without Mason's help and after Womack told Paxton about Mason's history; Paxton likely wasn't too concerned about apprehending Mason. Hence him smirking and backing up Goodspeed's story to Womack.",

This one is pretty obvious when Billy comes through the window and drops the phone.

        "answers": [
            "The film doesn't intend to explicitly detail around what time it is set, and instead it hints its timeline through the music, as director Danny Boyle has stated in the making-of interview. Boyle also claims that it is set more precisely around the late 1980s. There are, throughout the feature, some suggestions that it may actually be set in the early 1990s, such as the techno music and a scene on which the characters talk about \"Russian\" sailors (which means that the Soviet Union may have already ended). Anyway, Trainspotting can be set anywhere between 1987 and 1993 (the year the novel was released).Ignoring the soundtrack, the film visually features many elements of mid-to-late-80s that would be seen in Scotland at the time. At one point, Sick Boy and Renton discuss Sean Connery's career as being on a \"downward trajectory\" - aside from The Untouchables, which Sick Boy doesn't rate. This would place the film, at least, the first act, as being no later than early 1990, when Connery's career was reignited by The Hunt for Red October.In the 2017 sequel, Simon mentions that Renton has been gone for 20 years, which could place this movie around 2007. However, the statement of \"20 years\" may not be precise. Given the hints about the time period in the first movie (popular culture, current events etc.) it's likely to be more like 25 years. In Renton's \"Choose Life\" monologue he mentions the iPhone and social media, making it more likely that the sequel was set in the 2010s but not earlier than 2007, when the first iPhone was released."

They struggle for the zipline strap, which the President manages to secure to himself just as the zipline breaks from the door frame. The President is whisked out the door, leaving Gibbs behind. Gibbs is killed as Air Force One splashes and sinks into the water, while the President is pulled into the Hercules. After boarding the plane, Marshall is saluted by the American solders. When he is safely aboard, the Hercules pilot informs the anxious White House that the call name of the Hercules is now Air Force One, indicating that the President is on board. In the final scene, the Vice-President tears up the presidential incapacity order, the President hugs his family, and the F-15s resume their position flanking Air Force One as it brings the President home.",
            "In the script, Agent Gibbs was a CIA spook who was angry at his country. He knew the terrorists from his CIA days, so they included him in their operation. This scene was considered too long to tell, so it was cut from the film.",
            "Though it's never stated in the film, the implication is that he would frame Major Caldwell for Marshall's murder, and claim that he fought him off long enough to get off the plane. This is supported in the film's novelization. It is also implied that Gibbs would have pointed the finger at a fellow U.S. Secret Service agent for opening the cache and lending the weapons and bulletproof vests and pointed the finger at Major Caldwell for killing the President, and said that he killed the Major to protect the President and hold him off long enough to escape and then left the plane, and then have been executed for treason when his story fell apart.",
            "Scenes explaining why Gibbs was the mole and why exactly he turned rogue remains unknown to the viewers. We are never told of his motivations in the film. The audience is just left to assume he is a psychopath who turned crazy. It was cut out the final script because this scene was considered too long to tell. The director also felt that it was unnecessary to add in the film so it was removed as it was irrelevant to the plot. He felt its something insignificant that the audience doesn't really need to know about. According to director Wolfgang Petersen in an interview, Agent Gibbs was a former CIA agent who lost a lot after the end of the Cold War and thus became angry with the American government and wanted revenge. The hijackers never reveal to anyone Gibbs' true identity, to the point where they also tie him up along with President Marshall, Major Caldwell, and the Chief of Staff.",

This was also filmed this way to suggest she was having sex with the alien. Because that was one of Sigourney Weaver's demands when accepting the role. (Likely in the hopes they would refuse) So it was shot to imply she was being carried, but the sensual look on Ripley's face implies more.",
            "The Alien under water probably didn't show much interest in Call (Winona Ryder), since she was an android. She must have taken an alternate route, not visible from the elevator shaft. The elevator shaft where the Betty crew resurfaces looks pretty much like a dead end, so it is likely Call swam back into the kitchen after the Alien got out of the water. Perhaps she used a flooded air shaft used to vent off the air (visible when they swim through the kitchen). Also, during the swim through the kitchen, some of the shots show that there is a grated ceiling to the kitchen with the water line just above it, so Call may have been able to exit through one of those grates. Whatever the case was, she was able to crawl one floor up, where she could get out and open the door from the other side. Or maybe there was a service elevator used to transport food or an emergency escape tunnel leading to higher floors. The reason that she did not drown can be explained by the fact that she is an android, able to hold her breath longer, having a lower oxygen consumption than humans, or not requiring air at all.",
            "Christie (Gary Dourdan) sacrificed himself to save Vriess (Dominique Pinon). He is hit in the face with acid, Vriess is hanging onto the ladder and gradually losing his grip, so Christie cuts himself loose and hits the water. However, the exact means of his death is not explained. Viewers have suggested several possibilities: (1) The weight of the dead Alien that was latched on to his foot held him underwater, and he drowned. (2) The force with which he hit the water may have been hard enough for him to lose consciousness and drown. This is a very viable option, as water has a considerable surface tension, meaning that water can exert a large force on a body during an uncontrolled dive. The explanation as to why the same did not happen to Call is that she is a synthetic, who can sustain significantly larger impacts than humans. (3)The acid was eating through his skull. While the water would possibly help neutralize it, it might have been too far along, so he cut himself loose before he lost consciousness and died. This would also explain why he cut himself loose in the first place, knowing that he didn't have long to live and didn't want to die while Vriess was still strapped to him. After all the same amount, if not less of the acid ate through three floors of the Nostromo in Alien. (4) There were more aliens swimming around underwater, and they grabbed him when he hit the water. (5) It's possible that he didn't die, that he got out another way (perhaps the same way Call got out), made it to a lifeboat, and escaped on his own.",
            "She says that she is programmed to do so, and there is a solid basis for this. The famous science-fiction writer Isaac Asimov already proposed in 1942 that, for proper functioning, all robots should obey three laws: (1) A robot may never harm a human being, or cause a human being to be harmed by inaction, (2) A robot must obey orders given by a human being (unless these orders are in conflict with law 1), and (3) A robot must protect its own existence (unless this is in conflict with law 1 and 2). These three principles have been widely recognized throughout the genre of science fiction, and have become known as the Three Laws of Robotics. It is most likely that the androids in the Alien continuity (except for Ash in Alien) are programmed according to these laws. Although there are signs that the Second Law not always applies, as DiStephano mentions that the Autons \"didn't like to be told what to do\". Bishop mentions in Aliens that it is \"impossible for him to harm, or by omission of action, allow to be harmed, a human being\", which is a paraphrasing of the First Law. Call is also acting according to the second part of the First Law: if she does nothing to stop the scientists from creating the Aliens, the entire human race may die.",
            "There is a deleted scene included in the Special Edition DVD and Blu-Ray versions of the film where Call says she set the coordinates for the ship to crash into an uninhabited sector of the Earth. As we also see in the ending of the special edition, the survivors land in what was once Paris but is now a barren wasteland. It appears Earth was either abandoned by the majority of humanity or there was a war that nearly destroyed all life.",
            "It is confirmed in the movie by Gediman: the Queen laid her eggs, which spawned Facehuggers who would \"impregnate\" a host. But then \"she started to change, she started to have a second cycle (of eggs). This time, there is no host. There are no eggs. There is just her womb, and the creature inside of it. That is Ripley's gift to her, a human reproductive system!\" In other words, the DNA exchange worked both ways; Ripley got Alien characteristics, and the Queen got a human womb and human ovaries, enabling her to self-impregnate and spawn Alien/human hybrids. An early version of the script confirms this: GEDIMAN: Multiple reproductive systems. Complete asexual reproductive cycle, self-impregnating, we found six different sets of ovaries in her. Egg laying is the first cycle, immature. Redundancies, redundancies... she'll bring forth legion."

The Cullens had signed a prenuptial agreement, which would be void in the event of marital infidelity.

Later, however, when Kevin asks Melissa Black if she knows Cullen is circumcised, she doesn't know, meaning that she has never had sex with him and that Cullen is lying.

            "At the beginning of the film, Lefty brings Donny a ring to authenticate for him. Donnie dismisses it as a fake or \"Fugazi.\" They then go to the previous owner, who owns a nightclub. They get into a scuffle and make a deal for his car stay quiet about the incident. While it is never explained clearly if it was fake or not. It is likely it was.For one the real Donnie went to jewel school, and learned how to identify fake diamonds from real, as well as to their value or worth. Since he had to have a profession in criminal activity that did not involve violence, a jewel thief was perfect. In order to convince his mob buddies of his authenticity, he would have to know little things as to what makes it real or fake.Another clue as to the ring being fake is the nightclub owner's attitude toward Donnie. He comes off hostile and unruly. As if to make Donnie feel inferior to him. He also has a strong attitude toward Lefty as well as he seems tense when trying to convince him that the ring is real.The final thing is when Donnie takes a few punches at him, he gives in to Donnie's demands, which impresses Lefty, and demands that the owner give him his car. The quick change in emotion clearly states he was trying to cheat Lefty. As he figured with Lefty's age and inexperience in diamonds, he could easily scam him. It's also unlikely he would steal his wife's diamond ring and sell it for money, unless he was that broke, otherwise she'd likely sell it herself. Or if he was divorced.So yes the ring was a Fugazi.",

He kisses Annette goodnight, and after she goes in her bedroom he sneaks around to a drawer where he keeps his personal items. He puts his money, jewelry, and cross in the box. He then puts on his sunglasses and goes out the door. The scene implies he is going to his death for letting Donnie aka (Joseph Pistone) an FBI agent into the mob.In real life Lefty was never killed. The actions Lefty does before leaving his apartment mirror the actions of Sonny Black, who was the one who was killed for Donnie's infiltration. After discovering that Donnie was really and FBI agent, Sonny Black or \"Domnick Napolitano\" (Michael Madsen's character) was \"sent for\" by the mob higher ups since he was the one who proposed Pistone for membership and was more of his right hand man than Lefty was.Knowing he would likely be killed. He went into the bar under his apartment and left his valuables with the bartender whom he trusted. He then called his girlfriend said goodbye and said \"If you ever see Donnie again, tell him I loved him and if it was going to be anyone I'm glad it was him.\" Which in the movie are Lefty's last words. Sonny Black went to the meeting and as expected he was killed.It is debated whether or not Lefty was going to be killed. When Lefty was arrested he was in a car being driven to a meeting. Which some say was a set up to be killed, and was intercepted and arrested. Unlike the movie where Lefty still loved Donnie. He was bitter about Pistone infiltration. He was described by the real Joseph Pistone as a 24/7 gangster. Meaning he took the mob code of Omert\u00e0 (code of silence) very seriously. Lefty died of cancer in 1994.",
            "It's likely that Sonny Red felt that Sonny Black was gaining too much power and Red felt threatened. It's also possible that Black was holding out on Red, the operation in Florida was possibly without Red's approval and so Red felt it best to wipe them out in order to avoid Black becoming a rival.",
            "The Bonnano crime family would sooner or later know that he was a FBI agent, so the best thing for them to do was put him under immediate protection and admitting that he was working undercover. The Bonnano crime family also would likely put a high bounty on his head for knowing inside secrets so it was also a way to tell them that he is \"hands-off\" since the American Mafia would not go to war with the United States government as it is pointless and impossible to win (unlike the Sicilian mafia.)",

For reasons not shown in the movie he is transferred under Lefty.In reality, Jilly Greca was a soldier in the Colombo family who had his own small crew of associates that did mostly truck hijackings and home invasions. After months of working undercover, he had a dispute with one of Jilly's men, so Tony Mirra (soldier in the Bonnano's) took him under his wing because of his knowledge of jewelry and earning skills. When he finally went to prison for drug dealing offences, Lefty took his mentorship over.",

Lefty urges Donnie to make the kill just as the FBI show up and whisk away both Donnie and Lefty, while Lefty yells to Donnie, 'Don't tell them anything!'

Although it could be interpreted that the music was just a thematic choice and the door closing was either just a coincidence or an automatic door closing since nobody was near it. It's also possible that a rescue member did manually close the door but just happened to be off-screen and much like the music, the door closing could have just been a thematic choice, an aesthetic way to \"close\" the scene as well as the movie as a whole since it's the final shot before the end credits.Lietutenant Starck's dream or vision of an evil Doctor Weir in the form of a rescue worker could suggest that the evil had prevailed, showing itself to Starck and her hysteria could have been because she was experiencing the evil torturing her or showing her what is to come.Or the vision could have just been a bad dream from the traumatic events on the Event Horizon and Lieutenant Starck is just experiencing side effects from prolonged stasis. Earlier in the film, it was explicitly pointed out by D.J. that prolonged stasis can result in disorientation. Although not explicitly mentioned, it is possible that stasis could have further negative side effects aside from just disorientation such as bad dreams, something that Doctor Weir may have experienced near the beginning of the film as well from the same cause.",
            "The Dr. Weir who returns at the end of the film and confronts Miller is merely the ship's own manifestation of the doctor. The alien force on the ship personifies itself in the form of the ship's inventor, but the real Dr. Weir is dead and floating around in space after being blown out of the bridge.Alternatively, as Weir says \"the ship brought me back.\" It could be that Weir's spirit or even physical form is forever trapped on the ship or in the \"hell\" dimension. Even if he was to get sucked out in to space, the ship simply re-manifests him aboard due to his embracing of the horrors. While Miller and the rest of the crew had resisted or simply weren't able to be influenced by the ship.",
            "This may largely depend on each viewer's interpretation of the dimension itself. If you believe the dimension is the biblical version of hell, then its possible the crew's souls were trapped aboard the ship and by extension; hell. If you believe the dimension is simply an alternate dimension of chaos, then it would be more likely that once they died, that was the end of their suffering.Smith was killed aboard the Lewis & Clark when the bomb Weir planted exploded. So it's possible he escaped this fate in either interpretation due to him not being directly on the Event Horizon.D.J. and Peters were the only two we see die aboard the Event Horizon.Miller was trapped on the ship with Weir, he detonated the bombs to separate the lifeboat to save the surviving members of his crew. The remaining part of the Event Horizon then travels through the portal with Weir and Miller aboard. If you believe the \"hell\" interpretation, then Miller may have been saved from a horrible fate by ascending to heaven for his self-sacrifice. If you believe the \"chaos\" interpretation, then Miller would have suffered a horrific death but then found peace afterwards.",
            "That depends on your interpretation of the events.\nLooking at the film from a scientific perspective, the dimension is not in fact hell, but another dimension, a chaos realm where evil and cruel entities get people to torture, rape, and mutilate themselves and others. Similar to the realm from Hellraiser. A dimension where pleasure and pain are indistinguishable.From a more fantastical perspective, the realm is the actual biblical hell. The ship's gateway somehow opened a portal to the underworld. Allowing demons to corrupt the ship and its crew.",
            "Weir stops the crew from leaving the ship by putting a bomb on the Lewis & Clark. He then activates the Dimensional Gateway to send the ship back to Hell, but the sudden appearance of Cooper outside the ship triggers him to fire a bolt into the hull, causing a massive decompression which sucks Weir out. Miller gets the plan of blowing up the central corridor of the Event Horizon to use the Forward Decks as a lifeboat, but after activating all the bombs, a horribly scarred Weir (brought back by the ship) traps Miller in the Gateway room, and starts fighting him. Miller gets beaten badly and Weir gives him multiple visions of his remaining teammates being tortured and killed in Hell. Miller manages to detonate the bombs anyway, sacrificing himself to save Starck, Cooper and what was left of Justin.The gateway opens, taking Miller and Weir to Hell, while Starck, Cooper and Justin fly away in the lifeboat. Many days later, a rescue team arrives. One man frees Starck and assures her that she's safe, but then he removes his oxygen mask, and he is revealed to be Dr. Weir in his final form. Starck screams, and suddenly wakes up hysterically. She is surrounded by a rescue team and a freed Cooper tries to calm her down, assuring her it was just a dream. The camera pulls back out of the room, where the inner door suddenly closes out of itself, subtly suggesting that a part of Hell may still be present within the remains of the ship.",
            "When Justin investigates the Gateway, it opens by itself, pulling him into it. However at the end of the film, Weir needed to activate it to send the ship to Hell.There are several indications that the ship can perform actions itself; the banging sounds, dents appearing in the door, lights shutting off and on, and causing fires (unless these are hallucinations, of course).It's possible that the ship can open a portal, a doorway into the other dimension. But someone needs to activate the ship's drive in order to send the entire ship to Hell. Because if the ship could send itself, it probably would have done that as soon as everyone was on board.Another possibility is that the ship CAN send itself, but simply wants to try to 'convert' its crew first, because it needs an ally. There is only one moment when everyone is onboard, just after the Lewis and Clark has been damaged (later on, several crew members are in space making repairs). The ship could have tried to abduct them then; but activating the gravity drive takes 10 minutes, so the crew would probably have done everything to escape the Event Horizon.It seems likely that the ship wants see who of the crew will embrace the chaos willingly. This seems to be what happened with the original crew, some of whom immediately surrendered to the evil power (like the man who cut out his own eyes), and those who didn't were simply tortured and killed in a sadomasochistic orgy. So the ship may want to 'test' the crew of the Lewis & Clark first, to see who of them would be a useful ally. It is probably no coincidence that Dr. Weir, who has an obsession with the Event Horizon and is the one to convert to evil, is also the first to be targeted by the hallucinations (even before he is on the ship). Furthermore, when the ship returned to the solar system after 7 years, there was probably no former crew member left alive to send the ship back, giving further credibility to the idea that the ship can send itself, but awaits the right moment (unless the chaos dimension itself was somehow able to activate the ship).",
            "The Event Horizon's \"Gateway\" was supposed to create a tunnel through time and space, as Weir demonstrates with the magazine centerfold near the beginning of the movie. Rather than create a straight tunnel from one point in our universe to another, though, the Gateway instead opened a tunnel into another dimension. As already hinted at by Smith, a ship that was designed to circumvent the laws of physics and relativity may open the way to a place that is governed by no laws at all (hence a chaos realm). Another possibility is that while connecting one point in our universe to another, the tunnel simply traverses this other dimension. The intended destination for the ship and it's crew is Proxima Centauri.Where, or what, this dimension was is not only up to the viewer to interpret, but also went through several \"official\" versions. In an earlier draft of the script, more emphasis was given to the concept that the dimension was a living manifestation of chaos itself. In that draft, the final confrontation is not between Miller and Weir but Miller and an entity from the other dimension that has assumed Weir's form. The entity plainly tells Miller that it is not the Devil, but rather \"the dark behind the stars,\" and that it witnessed the Big Bang. This is starkly contrasted with the early versions of the movie, which included what Paul W.S. Anderson refers to as \"The Old Testament Speech,\" in which the possessed Weir explicitly tells Miller that the dimension is, in fact, Hell. As neither of these elements made it into the final picture, exactly where the Event Horizon went remains up to the viewer's interpretation.",
            "Under the influence of the dimension to which they traveled, the crew murdered one another in a sadomasochistic orgy. By advancing frame-by-frame during the \"final log\" sequence near the middle of the movie, the viewer can see a female crew member biting through the neck of another crew member as they have sex; two other crew members devouring a third as they engage in a three-way; a man reaching his arm down his own throat and tearing out his own stomach; a crew member having a stake driven through the back of his skull and the stake bursting through his clenched teeth; and, of course, the captain displaying his own eyeballs in the palms of his hands. Intercut with all of this are scenes of violent (but not apparently deadly) sexual intercourse, including one of the female crew members inserting some object into the rectum of one of the male crew members."

Even if she did figure it out she obviously chose to side with Archer (that is, Archer-as-Castor). Even though she hated Archer for threatening to take her son away for refusing to give up information about Castor, she hated Castor even more for walking out on her and Adam, and for the evil person he had become. Furthermore she knew that the man who looked like Archer was the one who shot her brother Dietrich, and Archer-as-Castor had opened up to her and shown genuine concern for her son, probably the only person in her life who had ever done so.Furthermore when she said \"take care of our boy\" she may have very well considered Archer to be more of a father to Adam than Castor could ever be, so the fact that she referred to Adam as \"our boy\" doesn't necessarily mean that she was oblivious to the switch.",

He felt that under the guise of Archer, he could eliminate all of his old associates and climb the ranks of the FBI and also gain a monopoly on organised crime."

In order for Leeloo to fulfill her role as Fifth Element, she needs to believe that humanity is worth saving. Near the end of the movie, Leeloo sees images of humanity's dark side, as well as its capacity for destruction, which puts her in a state of near-apathy. Korben thus has to convince her that love is humanity's redeeming value. The Diva may have already noticed that Leeloo is special to Korben, and that he may be her strongest connection to mankind. Therefore, she convinces him to profess his love for Leeloo, so as to trigger her into action once the four elemental stones are arranged.Also, the Diva was implying that love is no good on its own; it must be shared to be of any use, and also \"loving\" one another in a platonic sense is required to prevent self-destruction--the dark planet being representative of evil and as the 5th element pointed out, \"Everything you create is used to destroy.\"",

            "They were other men recruited by Smith to assist him in eliminating White and Exley. Smith had tricked the two of them into meeting at the Victory Motel so Smith and his men could kill them and make up a story about Bud and Ed betraying the department. Right after sending out the fake calls to the two, Smith called on several more men whom he could either trust to do what he ordered , were mixed up in the scheme he'd plotted throughout the story or that he could blackmail into taking part in operations like this, no matter how crooked they were. Some may be other corrupt cops or simply local thugs for hire.",

There's a brief scene where Exley talks to the police stenographer who took notes during the interrogation scene. She reads her notes and reveals that they'd previously gone to Roland Navarette's place for drugs, which is where Exley finds them.",
            "The original plan of having Michael Breuning and William Carlisle kill them at their apartment was foiled when Vincennes and Exley showed up early. The only explanation given for their escape is someone overheard saying \"How did they jump out the window anyway?\", implying they were left unsupervised in a place from which they could escape. The most likely answer is that Dudley or someone in his pocket let them go so they could be hunted and killed while resisting arrest, to tie up loose ends. Later, in the records room, after Bud White confronts Exley with Sid's blackmail photo of Exley and Lynn Bracken, Exley deduces this, and experiences a wave of revulsion and guilt with the realization that Dudley set him up to be the suspects executioner -- he wanted the three black men killed because no one would ask any questions. Additionally, when Exley is walking rape victim Inez Soto out of the hospital, she admits that she lied in her statement to the police about when the suspects left her before the Nite Owl incident. Exley is also somewhat stunned to hear that another factor contributed to the case that could blow it wide open.",

His M.O. is to photograph prominent politicians while they have sex with Patchett's prostitutes (like Lynn) to blackmail them later. He even does this with Exley (whether he did this with Bud White is not known but wouldn't be beyond him.) However, what Sid does not realize (as does Patchett ultimately) is that Dudley Smith basically sees everyone as disposable. As soon as they have served his purpose he's happy to get rid of them, and he certainly does not tell anyone all of his plans. Another good example of a character that does the same thing is Jimmy Conway in Goodfellas (1990). When Jimmy and his army of cohorts pull off the Lufthansa Heist, he has them all killed so he doesn't have to pay them their shares and so none of them can be found by the police and talk.",
            "Sid introduces Matt Reynolds (Simon Baker) to Ellis Loew (Ron Rifkin) because he heard that Loew was a closeted homosexual (he calls Loew a \"swish\" a derogatory term for a gay person from the time period), and he wanted to either expose him as such in Hush-Hush or to blackmail him at a later point. Recall Sid and Patchett were involved in blackmailing celebrities, as evidenced by Jack Vincennes' statement to Dudley just before Vincennes was killed by the captain. Later at the hotel, Reynolds and Loew were surprised by Smith, who was there to strong-arm Loew into giving him help by covering up various things. Reynolds overheard, was spotted and killed, while Loew was allowed to leave alive. Listen closely to Loew's confession as Bud White is dangling Loew out of the office window. Smith most likely kept Loew alive because his corrupt nature and influence could be useful in the future and because he promised never to prosecute them for any crimes.",
            "They had compromising photos of the DA with Matt Reynolds and were using them to blackmail Loew. The kid went to Loew to have sex with him, so Sid had blackmail material, just like he had on the city councilman who reverses his stance on a key political issue and Exley, both of whom Sid photographed having sex with Lynn Bracken.",
            "Exley is smart and exceptionally good at self advancement and departmental politics. He knew the situation that the department was in and he heard a snippet of their conversation when the detectives left the room. He deduced that the department was looking to sweep the incident under the rug and needed his cooperation to do so.",
            "Exley was determined to root out the bad apples one by one and clean up the LAPD.\nIf he had gone public, the police department would have closed ranks, dismissed him from the force, rubbished his claims as conspiracy theories or mud-slinging, and watched him disappear or even thrown him in jail. Also, Dudley was dead, and while it would be satisfying to drag his name through the mud and expose him for the psychopathic and corrupt individual he was, Exley knew that would severely damage the LAPD's already less than stellar reputation, embarrass Dudley's family (Dudley mentioned he had a wife and daughters) and put a halt on Exley's budding career, which wouldn't do anybody any good. By staying quiet, he was able to advance further in the department and be in a position to fulfill this agenda, as evidenced by his last line, \"They're using me, so for a little while I'm using them.\"."

Also, the hand clutching the wheel suggests the helmsman was taken by surprise. It's likely he would have noticed a T. rex crashing through the cargo hold and charging at him. Perhaps the best theory to put forth is that a lone Raptor boarded the ship, attacked the crew on the bridge, and a wounded crew member managed to bait the Raptor into the cargo hold to be killed by the T. rex before closing the hatch and succumbing to his wounds."

            "No. If the fictional events of this film occured, then at the very least, the broken handcuffs Jack wore when he died would remain on the sea floor. Skeletal remains might survive roughly a hundred years, in a near-freezing, anaerobic environment like the deep Atlantic. And if he had any metal (or maybe bone, antler, bakelite, etc) belt buckles, buttons, keys, coins, etc, they'd be likely to remain.",
            "Technically, no.The Diamond was meant to be a gift to Rose for her engagement, but it was still property of Caledon Hockley's family. Cal put the diamond in his coat pocket. Then he put the coat on Rose. So Cal technically gave the diamond to Rose, though unknowingly. Rose did not steal the diamond.At the begining of the movie, Brock explained Cal's father secretly filed an insurance claim on the diamond.So while it is arguable if Rose comitted stealing or not, what is not up for debate is the fact that if Rose had admitted to Mr. Lovett that she had the Heart of the Ocean, Rose would had to give it back either to Cal's descendants or to the people that were financing Brock's research.",
            "The most famously asked question; the answer is still hotly debated. However, if you watch the film closely, the film does provide an answer. Once Jack helps Rose on to the door, he tries to climb up as well, but the door flips over and dumps them both back in to the water, which is why Jack doesn't try to get on the door again. Even if he did manage to get aboard the door, it would likely have been partially submerged, defeating the purpose.On an episode of Mythbusters, they attempted this feat, with Jamie on the door and Adam attempting to climb on. The first several attempts to climb on the door ended the same as in the film; with it flipping over and dumping them in the water. It took several attempts at working together to stabilise the door in order to keep them steady enough. Though the door was still partially submerged. It wasn't until they took their life jackets off and tied them to the bottom of the door did they achieve enough buoyancy to keep the majority of their bodies out of the water and stabilise the door. So if you factor in the sub-zero temps of the water Jack and Rose were in, plus the fact that their muscles would very quickly start to seize up due to that, they did not have the time nor strength to keep trying different scenarios until they got it right.",

She was running away from her previous life, a life of unhappiness, social constraints and a loveless engagement. She also wants to honor Jack and their love story, by taking his last name. By giving the name Rose Dawson, she is symbolically starting a new life, and leaving behind the life of Rose Dewitt Bukater.",
            "Several of the events that lead up to and during the sinking are portrayed quite accurately. As for the actual sinking itself, it is portrayed fairly accurate to eye witness accounts. However, still heavily dramatized. James Cameron himself sat down with experts to recreate the sinking with a computer simulation. They deduced that the ship would have broke in half much sooner than the entire aft half being raised straight up out of the water, then breaking and crashing back down before being pulled straight under. Instead the aft would half been raised roughly half way out of the water, then the break happened and the forward section dragged the aft section under. James Cameron joked that he'll have to go re-shoot the ending to correct the inaccuracy.",

As Cal had said a few moments earlier to Jack as they watched Rose descend in the lifeboat (that she soon jumped out of), \"I always win, Jack. One way or another.\" Once Rose jumped back onto the Titanic and into Jack's arms, Cal saw that he wasn't going to \"win\" and his thought process was likely \"If I can't have her, no one can.\", making him homicidal.",
            "This is explained in a deleted scene (which can be seen on the Special Edition DVDs). The scene where Cal chases Jack and Rose originally ran longer. Knowing that Rose is unknowingly carrying the diamond, Cal tells Lovejoy that, if he can get the diamond, he can keep it. Lovejoy enters the flooded part of the ship, as Jack and Rose are trapped by a locked door. Seeing Lovejoy following them, they go and hide behind a table. Jack sneaks up on Lovejoy, and in the ensuing fight, Jack bashes Lovejoy's head through a window and then against a wooden beam. Jack and Rose then break out toward the upper deck, leaving Lovejoy unconscious.The scene was cut because test audiences didn't like it. No one would put their lives in jeopardy for greed.Disagreement with this last paragraph. People jeopardize their lives due to the pursuit of money all the time, and for far less than what that diamond would have been worth. Just look at all the regular occupations that fit this: deep sea fishing (note the show \"Deadliest Catch\"), coal mining, a 'roughneck' or 'roustabout,' logging, flying commercial aircraft (considered so dangerous, insurance companies won't provide life insurance for such pilots).",
            "There's a possibility that he did. An officer indeed shot himself on the deck, but no one knows for sure which, and it's most likely no one ever will. The officer who shot himself could have been either 1st Officer William Murdoch (Ewan Stewart), Chief Officer Charles Wilde (Mark Lindsay Chapman), or 6th Officer James Moody (Edward Fletcher), all of whom died that night. Witness testimonies over this matter varied. Some also say it was Captain Smith (Bernard Hill), but due to how recognizable he was, it's doubtful that anyone would confuse him, if he was indeed the man who shot himself. Murdoch could have done so over guilt for crashing the ship, Wilde could have done it because he lost some relatives in a car crash earlier, and Moody could have done it simply due to stress over how awful the situation was. It was most likely Wilde, because the officer who killed himself was in his section of the ship. Both Second Officer Charles Herbert Lightoller (Jonny Phillips) and Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall (Simon Crane) said that they hadn't noticed anyone shooting himself on the ship as she sank. Then again, Lightoller also stated that the ship never broke in half even though the wreck speaks for itself. Lightoller also wrote a letter, signed by himself and several other officers that Murdoch did not kill himself. Wireless Operator Harold Bride, who swam from the ship and survived the night on Collapsible B with Lightoller, said that he saw the bodies of both Murdoch and 6th Officer James Moody in the water. Both were dead. Murdoch was clinging to a deck chair and Moody appeared to have a head wound (which Bride said made him wonder if Moody had shot himself). Lightoller's testimony could be questioned, as there is little reason for Bride to lie about seeing Murdoch in the water. Based on this, if an officer committed suicide, it seems less likely that it was Murdoch and more likely it was Moody or Wilde.",
            "James Cameron really left that up to the audience to provide their own interpretations. Some people think that the very final scene is only a dream. Others are of the opinion that Rose died safe in her bed, just like Jack said she would and that the final scene is of their souls reuniting in the afterlife. Also, the fact that all the people present around the grand staircase are those who perished on the ship and the film fades to white after her and Jack kiss. Those people include the little girl Cora (killed in a deleted scene), whom Rose was unlikely to have known had died that night, in the arms of the father that Rose probably didn't connect with Cora. Also the clock is on 2.20 am, the time of the sinking. These are strong hints that this was her ascent to the afterlife and her becoming an honorary member of the \"Titanic Club.\"",
            "The movie gives us no explanation. In the alternate ending, she says that she didn't cash in on the diamond because she didn't want to rely on Cal for money. In any case, the Heart of the Ocean was unique and incredibly valuable, so it would be almost impossible to sell without attracting attention. The diamond was also her only tie to her life on the Titanic, so it served as a reminder of her promise to Jack to \"Never let go.\" She throws it into the water at the end of the film because, by that point, she had fulfilled her promise to Jack (to live her life to the fullest) and was ready to move on.",
            "Cal committed suicide after the stock market crash in 1929. In a deleted scene, he offers Lovejoy the diamond if he can bring him Rose (or stop Jack from winning her), so he apparently did not know whether or not she survived. If Rose became a noted actress after 1929, Cal would have posed no risk to her. If she was an actress before then, she might have done so without attracting his attention, especially if she performed on stage rather than on film and if she never achieved any real prominence. As she was 17 at the time the ship sank, her appearance would have changed as an adult, and the makeup used in early cinema was very heavy, therefore making her much less recognisable.Also, as wealthy as Cal was, he probably dismissed motion pictures as low-class entertainment attended by low-income people. His \"high-class\" entertainment options would have included classical music concerts, the opera, the ballet, and Shakespeare plays. If he never went to the movies, he never would have seen Rose on-screen.",
            "Some people think that Lizzy Calvert (Suzy Amis) is Jack's granddaughter. Not true. Rose says to Lizzy, \"I've never told anyone about Jack before, not even your grandfather\". Lizzy's grandfather was a guy named Calvert that Rose married in the 1920s.\nIf Jack and Rose conceived a child, the child would have been born in early 1913. Suzy Amis was born in 1962, so assuming Lizzy is the same age as the actress that portrays her, that means Rose's kid would have been almost 50 when Lizzy was born. While not unreasonable, it's more likely that Rose started having children after she met Mr. Calvert.An addition: Lizzy might have been Jack's granddaughter:\n1. When Rose mentions Lizzy's grandfather, she might have been using the term loosely, the way people say \"brother\" when the relation is actually a \"step-brother,\" or even a brother-in-law. This is also a usage that was more common one hundred years ago.\n2. When referring to Lizzy's \"grandfather,\" she might also have been using the term as shorthand to mean 'the man that Lizzy called her grandfather,' rather than the man who is her actual blood relation.\n3. Finally, she might have been a bit embarrassed by her carnal relations with Jack when she was so young and not married to him and not wanted to scandalize her granddaughter .",
            "We know that Ruth DeWitt Bukater was on the Carpathia; and Rose explained what happened to Cal in later life, but Old Rose never mentions what happened to her mother. Some assume that Ruth probably went poor and died penniless or married again to a merchant. Many widows of the Titanic disaster did marry again. While the mother was depending on Rose to marry Cal, she could herself have married later, perhaps to a less extravagant but still financially-secure level. Another possibility is that Cal made financial appropriation for her as his mother-in-law. Rose and Cal, as mentioned by Cal in the movie, would have been recognised as man and wife in practice, and Cal would have been very conscious of maintaining a gentleman's status in high society. It would have appeared extremely callous for Cal to cut Rose's mother loose with her daughter presumed dead."

            "Derek's shift away from his views happened gradually, starting with his stint in prison. Upon the beginning of his sentence, Derek initially joins a white supremacist prison gang, while simultaneously (reluctantly) befriending a black inmate whom he works with in the prison laundromat. Derek disapproves of his gang making deals with other non-white prison gangs, as he feels it contradicts with their ideals. After some time, Derek publicly denounces his Nazi allies by playing basketball with some black inmates and then not sitting with his crew at chow time. As punishment, the group of neo-Nazis rape Derek in the prison shower. After a visit from his former high school principal, Derek comes to the hard conclusion that he was on the wrong path and is desperate to get back on track.After getting released on parole thanks to the help of his former principal, Derek learns that his mentor, Cameron, whom Derek once considered a father figure, has lured his younger brother Danny into his neo-Nazi gang. Not only does this irritate Derek, but so does the revelation that Cameron ratted out a few of his fellow gang members in exchange for a lighter sentence. Once Derek cuts ties with his former gang, all his friends turn on him. Derek realized that the people whom he considered family were simply using him, and the people who he shared a common ideology with in prison didn't practice what they preached, and punished him for not going along.",
            "While Derek takes Danny to school, Sweeney and a police officer inform them that Seth and Cameron are in the hospital after being attacked the night before. However, in the final cut of the film we don't discover what actually happened. In a deleted scene, immediately after Danny and Derek cut ties with Cameron's gang, him and Seth head to a restaurant where they discuss their next steps, as they worry Derek may rat out their criminal activities to the authorities. After a confrontation with a mixed-racial couple, the two leave the restaurant. Unbeknownst to Seth and Cameron, they are being watched by a group of black men, including the teenager who shoots Danny the next day. They follow the duo and attack them with baseball bats.",
            "It's a commentary on how the small atrocities we might take for granted can infect our children's minds, and how easily parents can mislead their children into much greater evils. This, generally, is how bigotry has continued to thrive for so many generations - people aren't just born evil; they have to learn it from their environment. Derek's father wasn't overtly racist on the surface, but he did instill enough of his bias into his children that they could grow up rationalizing more and more bigotry until it consumed them and destroyed their family.It's a lesson to us that, as we raise children of our own, we had better be careful what we teach them so that they don't wind up learning outmoded beliefs which have no place in a hopeful future.",
            "Derek is likely smiling because he feels he's just achieved a major victory for his beliefs; killing two black men. In his head he's likely thinking about how the other neo-nazis will admire him for what he did.As for his look of worry; it's likely the realisation that he's about to go to prison for murder. Alternatively, it's not so much a look of worry as it is a look of rage\nWhich is how Derek feels every day. The briefest moment of elation is immediately replaced by hatred and anger.",
            "Derek shot and killed two black gang members who were trying to steal his car from the driveway in the middle of the night. At first it was simply self-defense (the gang member guarding the front door had a gun.) But after wounding the second man, the driver had escaped. Thus, Derek had no need to defend himself anymore as he had diffused the situation. Because the gang members were black, however, Derek took the wounded man to the curb and stomped his head against it. Derek probably would have gotten off or gotten a minor sentence for the weapons charge (assuming it was illegally obtained), etc., but he committed an act of cold-blooded murder compounded by a \"hate crime\" and was given a more severe sentence. When writing his paper, Danny almost inserts a line suggesting that, if he'd had to testify against his brother in court, Derek would have been charged with murder.",
            "In the trivia, it is stated that there was an extra scene at the end of the movie where Derek is seen shaving his head again, but the scene was cut because it was deemed \"pro-Nazi\". It is left ambiguous in the film as to whether or not Derek intends to revert to his old ways. While in prison, Derek learned that hate is a waste of time and that he only was acting out because he was angry about his father being murdered. He came to realize that not every black person was like the one who killed his father. He tells his story to Danny who, by the end of the film, obviously sees the light, but in a tragic twist of irony, Danny is gunned down by Henry, a black person he had earlier insulted. It isn't unthinkable that this would distort Derek's perception and make him believe he was previously right. However, once someone has an epiphany and their mind is opened up to such matters, it is rarely closed back up. Yes, Danny was killed by a black man, as was their father. However, Derek would still understand that not everyone was like that. Dr. Sweeney is a perfect example as he wanted to do nothing but good and help troubled youths. The last line Derek says in the film is (knowingly) \"Oh Jesus. God, what did I do?\". In this it could be implied he does not revert to his old ways but blames himself for what has happened. This would mean he would not revert to his old ways as his brother's death would be in vain. Henry killed Danny as his vengeance for Derek killing and curb stomping his brother. Derek would probably realize this not long after the situation and see it was his doing that led to his brother's death and he doesn't blame Henry as much as he blames himself and therefore would remain on his new path of righteousness.Furthermore, it's probably implausible for Derek to want to re-associate himself with his former neo-Nazi cohorts, given his experiences with them during his time and prison and immediately after his release.It is also important to note that Derek, when posed the question from Dr Sweeney \"Has anything you've done made your life better?\", Derek tearfully and genuinely responds that, no, it hasn't. It's safe to say Derek has well and truly changed his life outlook from that point."

As pilots Sharpe (William Fichtner) and Watts (Jessica Steen) prepare the ship for liftoff, Harry makes a final tearful call to Grace in order to say goodbye. When the ship's thrusters refuse to start, Watts attempt to fix them without success. Obviously tired of Watts' take charge attitude, Lev pushes her aside and bangs the thrusters with a pipe wrench, getting them to start.

            "Percy may not have been evil, but he was a cruel and sadistic bully. He certainly deserved to be punished for his actions. Including deliberately sabotaging Del's execution. Which lead to Del dying in excruciating agony.\nWild Bill was a child molester and murderer who had no remorse over his actions and in fact enjoyed every second of it.John Coffey had to touch someone in order to transfer the \"sickness\" to and from a person. There's no way John was going to be able to get to Wild Bill. So he grabbed Percy, transferred the sickness to him. Percy then guns down Wild Bill and is in turn sent to the very mental institution he was supposed to transfer to. John felt that Wild Bill deserved to die. Percy deserved punishment, but not death. So Percy was put in a position where he could never hurt anyone again.",
            "Because despite Del being a condemned man, Brutal, Paul and all the men under their command believed in respecting life. Despite Del's crimes, he was remorseful. Del was somewhat simple-minded and he was polite, respectful and compliant with the guards. Percy joined the mile because he wanted to bully and torment some condemned men in order to make himself feel superior. Brutal and Paul believed that a condemned man should not be made to suffer. Which is exactly what Percy did by deliberately not soaking the sponge.",
            "\"Red over green\" by Thomas Newman.",
            "Water, particularly salt water, is a good conductor of electricity. Having the brine-soaked sponge causes the electricity to move in a more efficient line, thus killing the prisoner faster (in the film, this is described as a \"bullet straight to the brain\"). Without the sponge, the electricity would simply disperse over the body, meeting with a lot of resistance, causing the body to cook, and death would be much more agonizing, as seen during Del's execution.",
            "The easiest answer that we see in the film is that there wasn't time. When Paul figures things out, Percy (Doug Hutchison) has given the order, Jack (Bill McKinney) has already thrown the switch, and it's much too late to stop things and rewire Del so that he'd suffer much less. The scene is depicted in real time, but doesn't actually happen that way. There are two things going on at once: (1) Percy's management of the entire execution and his orders being followed (\"Roll on two!\" the order to throw the switch), and (2) Paul's reaction to the revelation about the sponge, the consequences that will inevitably result, and the reaction of the witnesses gathered in the room. It's all done very well to give the viewer a sense of the sequence of events involved, however, it's not actually \"real time\" as we know it. So, by the time we see everyone's actions and Paul's reaction, it's too late.When the current is on, Paul could have theoretically ordered to stop the electricity, and soak the sponge before resuming. Given the benefit of hindsight, that would certainly have been the best option. However, it probably would have looked extremely bad if Paul had interrupted the procedure, making it seem like he and the other guards can't conduct a proper execution. It's also safe to assume that nobody has witnessed an execution where the sponge was dry, so nobody had any realistic idea of how long Del's suffering would continue. Paul may have thought that Del wouldn't have lasted much longer anyway, or at the very least would pass out from the shock pretty quickly. Interrupting the execution could have unnecessarily prolonged his suffering. However, to the guards' horror, there almost seems to be no end to Del's protracted ordeal. Needless to say: had the guards known that Del would have to suffer such an extended agony, they would undoubtedly have interrupted the procedure. Unfortunately, they didn't.",
            "This is not fully explained in either the movie or the novel. When Coffey tried to revive the little girls, he mentioned that he tried to \"take it back\", suggesting that sickness and death are phenomena that can invade a person, but can also be taken out again. Think of it as the physical manifestation of whatever disease or sickness John \"sucked\" out of those he helped. In the short story The Little Sisters of Eluria, King describes \"Doctor Bugs\", which are parasitic organisms that first heal people so that they might feed on them slowly. It's been tossed around that Coffey's \"bugs\" may or may not be the same kind of organism, though there's no confirmation one way or the other or even that they are bugs.",
            "At the time of their murder, there was no link between the girls and Wild Bill Wharton (Sam Rockwell). He was simply a drifter who worked for food and a place to sleep, and he had moved on by the time the girls went missing. When they were found in the arms of John Coffey, a poor, simple-minded, imposing black man who was saying, \"I tried to take it back, but it was too late,\" that was proof enough to everyone that Coffey was guilty.",
            "Paul had no physical evidence to prove that John was innocent. Just saying that John showed him what really happened through a psychic link wouldn't exactly go over well. John's knowledge of the details would have only convinced a jury that John indeed had committed the crime. Then, Percy shooting and killing Wild Bill ruined any chance of him ever admitting to the crime. On a less pragmatic note: John Coffey himself admits that, prisoner or no, his life is one of constant pain and suffering, as a result of his sensitivity to the evil in the world. To quote him directly: I'm tired boss. [...] Mostly I'm tired of people being ugly to each other. [...] It's like pieces of glass in my head all the time.\nAfter hearing this, Paul came to the conclusion that sending John Coffey to the chair could justifiably be considered an act of kindness.",
            "Death row guard is in no way shape or form a delicate job and you would be surprised by the number of those that work in jails. They choose a job where the can enjoy themselves and that is exactly where they belong: hurting people who have hurt others. This question was a bit self-evident.Percy is the nephew of the Governor of Louisiana's wife, so he had political connections. If Percy felt that he was being mistreated, he'd simply call his mother or the Governor himself and complain like a spoiled child -- which he does, early in the film when he petulantly breaks Del's fingers and Paul orders him off the Mile. The other argument is that it's a different time period. In the 1930s it was much easier for an inhumane person like Percy to work at such a job. The laws hadn't been changed to, say, profile a person like Percy for his mental illness. In modern times, a condition like Percy's would've been discovered either through psychoanalysis when he applied for the job or because he'd caused a tragedy to happen. In the time the film was set, it wouldn't matter if Percy had been abusive toward a prisoner like Del, people would think Del was getting his just desserts for his crimes. The sabotage of Del's execution is something that might not have gone unnoticed by the proper authorities, however, Paul, Brutal, Dean, Harry and Warden Moores are able to cover it up since their jobs are at stake as much as Percy's would be. Percy, however, might have come out clean because of his connections to the governor's office.",
            "Because of the accidental \"gift\" John Coffey transferred to the mouse while holding the mouse during Del's execution. John says later that the mouse felt what he felt. When Paul takes John's hand and sees what John saw of the murders, John gives him the same gift, although this time purposefully. However, there is no indication that Mr Jingles will live \"as long as\" Paul Edgecomb, only that they both will have extended lifespans. Coffey's healing of Paul and Mr Jingles was as much a curse as it was a gift: the price that Paul pays is that he'll outlive everyone he loves, such as his wife, his son, and Elaine.",
            "As old Paul says at the end, \"We each owe a death, there are no exceptions. But oh God, sometimes the Green Mile seems so long\". His concern seems somewhat justified: by the end of the movie, Mr Jingles is at least 64 years old, about sixteen times the lifespan of a normal mouse; if the same logic applies to Paul, that would mean he could theoretically reach an age somewhere between 1300 and 1500 years, though it's ambiguous as to whether he is still able to die from external causes.",
            "Paul Edgecomb is 108 years old and still alive. His wife Janice was killed in a bus accident in Alabama in 1956. Melinda \"Melly\" eventually died of a heart attack in 1943, and her husband, Warden Hal Moores, died of a stroke in 1941. Brutus \"Brutal\" Howell died of a heart attack while eating a fish sandwich, Harry Terwilliger died in 1982 of intestinal cancer, and Dean Stanton was stabbed in the neck by a prisoner four months after John Coffey was executed. William \"Wild Bill\" Wharton was shot by Percy Wetmore in 1932, and Percy went catatonic and lived in mental institutions until his death in 1965. Mr Jingles died of old age in 1996."

He used to be the sidekick of Melkor (Morgoth), the banished Vala, sort of equivalent of Lucifer/Satan, the most powerful angel turned to evil. After Morgoth was defeated, Sauron assumed power as a lesser Dark Lord. He knew how to make Rings of Power, and taught the craft to the Elves (who made the Three). He waited until the other nineteen rings were made and deployed, then made the One Ring \"to rule them all\". (In some versions of the story, the Elves made their Rings at his request, when he pretended to have changed his ways.) Gandalf and the other Istari (wizards) are also Maiar, and so were the Balrogs.

The two staves are shown in the Fellowship of the Ring Appendices 1 Design Galleries section. It's also very possible that Gandalf had other staves hidden around Middle Earth in case any were lost or damaged beyond use. He reacquires the new staff around the time he meets the hobbits in Rivendell so it's quite likely that he'd stored one there. The new one he wields simply looks very much like the one he lost."

            "Nyah is a former lover of Ambrose and walked out on him 6 months earlier. Swanbeck required Nyah for the mission, when Ambrose was suspected of masterminding the plane crash and the murder of Dr. Nekhorvich and stole the Chimera virus, when Ambrose disguised himself as Ethan and escorted Dr. Nekhorvich to Atlanta. Swanbeck wanted Nyah to resume her relationship with the renegade IMF agent and report to Ethan, in order to recover the Chimera and bring Ambrose down and was their fastest chance of finding him. But Swanbeck misled Ethan as well as Nyah into believing Nyah was being recruited due to her skills as a professional thief and to steal back a stolen object and Ethan not knowing of Nyah and Ambrose's relationship and that the Chimera is a engineered virus.",
            "Thanks to some fancy motorcycling, Ethan manages to outrun (or destroy) the cars of Ambrose's henchmen, but Ambrose himself takes up the chase on his cycle. Meanwhile, Nyah has made her way to the North Point bluffs with every intention of throwing herself to her death. With little time left on her 20-hour countdown, Ethan orders Luther and Billy to pick her up in their helicopter and bring her to him. Following a lengthy face-off in which Ethan ends up retrieving his gun from the sand and shooting Ambrose, he tosses a Belleraphon-filled syringe to Luther who injects it into Nyah. Several days later, Ethan meets with Mission Commander Swanbeck (Anthony Hopkins) who assures him that Nyah has recuperated and that her criminal record is expunged. In the final scene, Ethan and Nyah meet up in a park in Sydney and decide to continue their vacation somewhere where it's quiet.",

When the two motorcycles crash, Hunt's USP falls onto the beach. When Hunt and Ambrose start fighting, there is a close-up of Hunt's Beretta falling out of his holster. This is the gun Ambrose finds at the end of the film. Hunt uses the other gun, the USP. There are many viewers who maintain that this is a continuity mistake and cite the fact that Hunt used TWO Berettas in the BioCyte shootout, not a Beretta and a USP. They say the gun Hunt fires at the end belongs to Ambrose, even though he was using a Browning BDA during the motorcycle chase. The decision to have Hunt use a different gun at the end was possibly taken to avoid confusion by having the two men fire the same model of gun. The shooting script states that the gun Hunt finds in the sand at the end of the film belongs to Hunt."

            "No, Lisa Trevor is different from the Lisa in this movie because her name is Lisa Addison, a computer programmer, the sister of Matt Addison, and, through some subterfuge, an employee of the Umbrella Corporation who worked on underground lab The H.I.V.E.",
            "You can only turn into a zombie after you die. Red Queen killed everyone but, as they were already infected, they turned into zombies. You can also see this with Rain (Michelle Rodriguez). She turns into a zombie the moment she dies, although she had been infected way before that. Red Queen kills everyone by releasing the facility's fire prevention system, which contains halon gas. It can put out fires in the offices without ruining any computers, like water sprinklers would. However, if a person is exposed to a great deal of the gas, there is also a risk of toxic and irritant pyrolysis products, hydrogen bromide, and hydrogen fluoride. Basically, Red Queen poisoned the personnel. Since they were already infected by the virus, they came back as zombies.",
            "The zombies never entered that room, so it's assumed that Red Queen had some sort of \"self-cleaning\" feature for the hallway. It's a reference to the games where bodies will disappear if you leave a room and then come back to it.",
            "Matt and his sister Lisa (Heike Makatsch) are environmental activists, planning to expose the illegal viral and genetic experimentation being secretly carried out by the Umbrella Corporation. With the help of a contact in the Hive, Lisa infiltrated Umbrella to smuggle out evidence. Alice was that contact. Alice and Spence Parks (James Purefoy) are security operatives for Umbrella. Their job is to protect the mansion, which covers the access into the Hive. As part of the cover, they are posing as husband and wife. Though they appear to have turned their cover in to an actual relationship. At least a sexual one.",
            "The antivirus works because it cures. It didn't work on Rain because Red Queen herself said, \"This long after infection, there's no guarantee it would work.\" Also, she was bitten numerous times in vital areas, causing the infection to spread faster.",
            "Yes. Toward the end of the movie, it's revealed that Spence overheard Alice talking with Lisa about accessing the Hive in order to get enough proof to expose Umbrella and shut them down, so he decided to steal both the T-virus and the antivirus himself. To cover his tracks and ensure that he would be the only one in possession of the virus & the antivirus, he released one container of virus inside the Hive, intending that it be shut down, making his virus & antivirus extremely valuable. It's possible he was planning to frame Lisa and possibly Alice as well for the outbreak. But given that Spence and Alice had a sexual relationship and he wrote the letter to her. It's likely he was going to tell her that he stole the virus. So the company would be brought down and he could sell the virus making them both rich."

Cyclops gets off a blast that knocks Magneto away from the machine, allowing Wolverine to rescue Rogue, who is near death. Holding Rogue near to him, Wolverine transfers his regenerative ability into her, bringing himself near death, too. He wakes up in Jean's laboratory, lying next to Professor Xavier, who has recovered from his coma. When Wolverine is fully recovered, he decides to relocate to an abandoned military compound near Alkali Lake in the Canadian Rockies in hopes of learning more about his past. Just before he leaves, a news broadcast shows what can only be Mystique impersonating Senator Kelly (Bruce Davison), who publicly announces withdrawal of his support for the Mutant Registration Act. In the final scene, Xavier is playing chess in Magneto's plastic prison cell. Magneto warns Xavier that the war is still coming and he intends to fight it. \"And I will always be there, old friend,\" Xavier assures him.",
            "It is unknown whether Toad was killed by Storm's attack. Toad was hit by lightning and then hurled screaming into the air, splashing in the water. As he still made sound while falling, the electricity of the lightning was probably not lethal. Provided that Toad fell from one of the stories within the foundation of the Statue of Liberty (where the exhibition is located), his plunge was at least 65 feet (20 meters), and could have been as high as 154 feet (47 meters). A fall onto a water surface from such heights can be lethal, but is not necessarily so. Besides, Toad is a mutant with a physique capable of jumping enormous heights and dropping onto other people without harm to himself, so he could have survived the fall into the water. This, of course, does not rule out the possibility that he passed out and drowned. A set was constructed (and not used) inside Stryker's underground bunker for X2, which was meant to be the stage for a fight between Nightcrawler and Toad, so the filmmakers probably intended for Toad to have survived his fall.",
            "Sabretooth is hit by Cyclops' optic blast, sent through the wall of the Statue of Liberty, and sent plummeting into the roof of a boat and likely into the water below. It is unclear whether or not he is dead. Given that he can survive falls from great heights, this wouldn't be a concern, his healing abilities would be able to mend any broken bones. However if he was knocked unconscious either by the optic blast or the impact from the fall, he could have drowned. He doesn't appear in the two sequels to this film and is never mentioned again.\nIf he did survive, it's possible he went rogue and chose not to re-join with the Brotherhood. In the novelization of X2, it is briefly mentioned that he is the subject of an international manhunt.",
            "Wolverine has superhuman senses, including a highly acute sense of smell. He can identify people just by smelling their individual scents-each person's is unique. Even though Mystique has the power to change her appearance and voice into someone else, she cannot (or at least did not) change her scent. When she approached Wolverine while shapeshifted as Storm to deceive him, he smelled the air and knew that was not the real Storm."

            "Although it was never completely explained in the prequel movies, basically the Force is the energy that gives life to all living things and binds everything together. When a person dies, his or her essence or soul is released, and this energy is absorbed into the Force. The same happens to Qui-Gon but, later in the saga, he is able to \"return from the netherworld of the Force\", as Yoda says. Apparently, during life, Qui-Gon mastered the Force enough to not completely dissolve into it after his death and was able to partially hold onto his own identity. He was able to communicate to Yoda and Obi-Wan, who he could teach how to retain their own individual Jedi essences. How and why this entails complete disappearance of the body was never mentioned, however. It could be theorised that only Obi-Wan and Yoda learned this power. When Darth Vader strikes down Obi-Wan, in Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977), he seems baffled that Obi-Wan's body vanished completely.",
            "In The Phantom Menace, Palpatine begins his ploy to gain control of the galaxy as follows:Step 1: Under the guise of Darth Sidious, he manipulates Viceroy Nute Gunray of the Trade Federation into creating a trade boycott on the planet Naboo.Step 2: When the Jedi get involved, Sidious orders the Viceroy to begin invading Naboo. In order to make the invasion legal, the Viceroy needed to force Queen Amidala of Naboo to sign a treaty, however the Jedi had helped her escape the planet.Step 3: When the Queen arrives on Coruscant, Senator Palpatine convinces her that Supreme Chancellor Valorum is powerless against the bureaucrats, who are on the Trade Federation's payroll, and to start a vote of no confidence in the Galactic Senate against Valorum.Step 4: After the vote of no confidence passes, Palpatine informs the Queen that he was among the three candidates nominated to replace Valorum. Instigating the invasion of Naboo was to help generate sympathy in the Senate to garner his nomination and election as Supreme Chancellor.Step 5: The Queen insists on heading back to Naboo, and Palpatine pleads for her to stay, presumably hoping that the conflict will escalate and create a schism within the Senate itself. However, she refuses to abandon her people. So as Sidious, he informs the Viceroy to wipe out all the resistance and to capture the Queen.Step 6: After the Trade Federation unexpectedly loses the battle, the Viceroy and his staff are sent to stand trial in the Senate. With the power of the Trade Federation temporarily broken, the balance of power within the galaxy has been restored for the moment. This is a setback for Palpatine, now Chancellor: with his apprentice, Darth Maul, dead as well, the political instability he was hoping to exploit is averted, and he needs to bide his time for when another opportunity arises. However, he befriends Anakin, seeing potential in him as a future assistant in his scheme."

            "Step 1: Shortly after The Phantom Menace, Darth Sidious orders his new apprentice, Darth Tyranus, a.k.a. Count Dooku, a former Jedi, to travel to Kamino in order to commission the Kaminoans to create a clone army for the Galactic Republic under the guise of Jedi Master Syfo Dias. Dooku also starts fostering discontent among leaders of star systems over the widespread corruption and abuse of power within the Galactic Senate. (Though some expanded universe stories claim that Syfo Dias himself commissioned the clone army without the consent of the Jedi Counsel because he sensed they may need them. Shortly after this, Dooku murdered him.)Step 2: Ten years after the end of The Phantom Menace, many planets have joined a Separatist movement led by Dooku. Since both the Trade Federation and the Techno Union are prominent members, the Separatists start to become a military threat to the Republic. Supreme Chancellor Palpatine proposes a vote in the senate to decide whether or not the Republic should build an army to resist the growing Separatist threat, as the Jedi are no longer capable of maintaining the peace. He has also formed a friendship with Anakin Skywalker, who is susceptible to his subtle influences due to Anakin's sometimes strained relationship with his Jedi master Obi-Wan Kenobi.Step 3: Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala returns to Coruscant to vote in the senate. As she is firmly opposed to the creation of a Grand Army of the Republic and her vote carries much weight with the rest of the senators, two attempts are made on her life by assassins hired by Tyranus. Palpatine uses this to insist that Padm\u00e9 go into hiding on Naboo and be accompanied by Anakin as protection. This gets Padm\u00e9 out of the way for a while, and she gives her proxy to Representative Jar Jar Binks while she is gone. Palpatine likely also sensed that Anakin felt strongly for Padm\u00e9 and may have sensed stirrings in her too. Therefore them being alone together would cause Anakin to form an attachment which Palpatine could later use to his benefit.Step 4: When the Jedi learn that the Separatists under Dooku are creating a new droid army by merging the combined droid armies of the Trade Federation (battle droids), the Techno Union (super battle droids), as well as the Commerce Guild (homing and dwarf spider droids), the Corporate Alliance (tank droids), and the Intergalactic Banking Clan (the missile-carrying Hailfire battle droids), they inform Palpatine of this matter. Palpatine and his aides subtly trick Jar Jar into using Padm\u00e9's authority to recommend granting Palpatine immediate emergency powers so that he can combat the Separatist threat without the approval of the senate.Step 5: Palpatine claims that he \"reluctantly\" accepts the powers he is given and vows to give power back to the senate once the Separatist threat has been averted. He then uses the emergency powers to commission an army for the Republic. Conveniently, the clone army was already commissioned and ready to be deployed by this time. Palpatine cleverly uses his influence to play both sides against each other, in order to gain more power as the conflict escalates. The initial battle on Geonosis is the beginning of the Clone Wars, during which he can use and extend his power without much interference from the senate, while at the same time gaining massive popularity from the public.",

However, if you watch the scene where he is killed very closely, you will see two shadows on the floor of the area: one is from his helmet and a second, harder to notice, is for his head, which falls out of the helmet. Obviously, being a PG movie, the filmmakers could not show a severed human head bouncing around.

He does bring balance to the Force, by destroying the Sith, meaning the Emperor and himself. And he does this because he is redeemed by his son.\"",
            "Anakin has a dream that Padm\u00e9 is going to die during childbirth, but she actually dies because of Anakin himself. He was essentially foreseeing the future in his dream, but misinterpreting the reasons behind the event. His attempt to avert that future is the very thing that causes it to become reality, an example of self-fulfilling prophecy. Palpatine knows of Anakin's fear of losing Padm\u00e9, and plays on that fear by telling Anakin that the dark side of the Force has the power to cheat death (something that Darth Plagueis managed to help others do). In pursuing that end, Anakin embraces the dark side and in so doing destroys Padm\u00e9's trust in him after he tries to kill her on Mustafar.",
            "It was the deflection of his own Force lightning, originally directed at Mace Windu, which caused Sidious's facial deformity. Although both Anakin (in Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones (2002)) and Luke (in Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983)) both suffer Force lightning being aimed at them, neither of them are left physically scarred by the incident. However, Anakin was only hit briefly at a distance by Count Dooku's Force lightning, and it may well have been that the Emperor did not intend to kill Luke immediately, wanting his death to be slow and painful as he gloated to him. As Sidious was simultaneously firing and being hit by the lightning deflected back from Mace's lightsaber, it caused an amplified electrical feedback loop effect which damaged Sidious's body and almost killed him; and perhaps due to the involvement of the Force, Sidious's body became deformed rather than burned. (Some people have speculated that the Force lightning deflection and feedback revealed Sidious's true from by eroding away some kind of mystical facade.) Printed literature from around the time of Return of the Jedi simply stated that the Emperor's body and features had been \"gnarled\" over time by his extended use of the dark side of the Force.In The Rise of Skywalker, the cloned body of Palpatine, while rotting due to not being able to sustain the darkside energy, his appearance is that of normal-looking Palpatine. However, once he drains the life-force from Ben Solo and Rey, restoring his body to its true form, Palpatine has the \"deformed\" look. So this would confirm that when Palpatine is at full power, the dark side seems to deform his face, and he likely uses the force to mask this facade before becoming Emperor or simply suppressed his full potential in order to avoid detection from the Jedi.",
            "First, the lightsaber wounds from Obi-Wan's blade, however serious, are not immediately fatal because the weapon cauterizes (seals) wounds on impact, explaining the lack of blood loss. The most devastating event in this scene is the fire, which leaves Vader scarred and deformed. There are two possible reasons why Vader could survive such an ordeal. Vader is the most powerful Jedi/Sith in the galaxy, and his power seems to give him a great resistance to or ability to fight death, more than most ordinary beings or even other Jedi. It is also said that Vader's hatred and anger (from turning to the dark side of the Force) gives him a greater source of energy, allowing him to defy his seemingly obvious fate. The Sith can also use pain to feed their hate and anger, thus strengthening them through the dark side of the Force. Sometime off-screen in between when Obi-Wan leaves him for dead and when the Emperor finds him, Vader clearly manages to extinguish the flames, either through use of the Force, or allowing it to burn out and be consumed by the soil, rocks and natural sources around him. However, he is still in critical condition with most of his skin and hair burned off and his lungs seared from the intense heat of the flames. It seems that the Emperor's arrival is the ultimate factor in Vader's survival. He uses technological methods, i.e. the medical capsule which he requests from his troops, but there is even a hint, by the way he places his hand on Vader's forehead, that he is using the Force to keep his apprentice alive long enough to be treated properly, much like he proposed he could do with Padm\u00e9. This is at least partially supported by the fact that Obi-Wan precisely echoes this gesture when he revives Luke after his encounter with the Sand People, in Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977). The placing of the hand on the forehead is a healing power among Jedi and it may also produce a calming effect. Clearly needing long-term support to continually stay alive, the Emperor orders artificial limbs and a survival suit be constructed for Vader (complete with internal I.V. medicines, life-support controls, and a helmet respirator connected to a battery pack to help Vader breath from his badly burned lungs).In the canon Marvel comics, it is stated that the life support apparatus used by Darth Vader following his injuries was created by an Imperial scientist called Cylo, who also uses similar technology to create potential rivals for Vader as an apprentice at the Emperor's side.",
            "Vader had lost all of his limbs and had third degree burns all over his entire body. Burn victims are extremely susceptible to infection and Vader's lungs would have been scarred from the ash and hot air he was breathing in while burning alive. It is likely the only reason Vader survived is due to his strength in the Force and the futuristic medical technology that the Emperor commissions for him. Vader gets another robotic arm and two robotic legs, all the charred clothing attached to him is peeled off by medical droids, and he is then fitted in the cumbersome suit which would have built-in medical capabilities to protect and heal his burns while he wears it. The suit also comes with a built-in respirator which helps him breathe.",
            "Senator Bail Organa remained a member of the Imperial Senate as a representative of Alderaan, but as the Emperor moved more and more power away from the elected members of the Senate and into the hands of his own appointed regional governors (such as Grand Moff Tarkin), Bail continued to work in secret with other senators (such as Mon Mothma) to form the Rebel Alliance. Deleted scenes from Revenge of the Sith show the first of these meetings and what is effectively the birth of the Alliance. His work was continued by his adopted daughter, Leia, who later became a senator herself, until the Emperor dissolved the Senate completely around two decades after the formation of the Empire. Bail is killed off-screen in Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977) (A New Hope), when the Death Star destroys Alderaan.Bail appears again in the TV series Obi-Wan Kenobi (2022), which takes place around a decade after Revenge of the Sith. He also appears in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016), which is set two decades after Revenge of the Sith and immediately prior to A New Hope. In all of these live action films and shows, he is portrayed by actor Jimmy Smits.",
            "When Padm\u00e9's body is shown in the funeral procession, it appears she is still pregnant. This was done intentionally so that it seemed that she had not yet given birth at the time of her death and that the child she was carrying had died in her womb. That way, her husband (now Darth Vader) and the Emperor would not wonder what had happened to the child (or twins, as it turned out) and go and find them. Additionally, a woman still looks enlarged just after giving birth. Even if a baby had been stillborn, she would have looked larger than normal. In the canon Marvel comics, Darth Vader's ally Doctor Aphra visits a mortician that prepared her body for burial. All of this is confirmed in said conversation.",
            "Three years have passed since the start of the Clone Wars and neither side seems to be gaining much ground any longer. Supreme Chancellor Palpatine has been able to use the Clone Wars to extend his term of office, but has now apparently reached the limits to where he can stretch his emergency powers.Step 1: So he devises a bold move, by allowing himself to be kidnapped by Count Dooku, until Anakin and Obi-Wan rescue him. As Anakin emerges victoriously and Dooku has out-lived his usefulness, Palpatine convinces Anakin to kill Dooku. According to the novelization, Palpatine's original plan was for Dooku to kill Kenobi, enabling Palpatine to recruit Anakin immediately after Dooku's death. Kenobi's survival prompted Palpatine to alter his plans slightly.Step 2: After his rescue, which likely garnered much more sympathy for Palpatine as well as renewing the fear for Separatist aggression, the Galactic Senate grants him even more emergency powers. Palpatine receives near-complete control over the Galactic Republic for the rest of the war, the Senate fulfilling merely an advisory function. However, he knows there is only one more commander of Separatist forces to be eliminated before emergency powers will have to be returned to the Senate: General Grievous.Step 3: Palpatine announces the appointment of planetary governors to every system of the Republic, further bypassing any influence from the Senate (as revealed in a deleted scene).Step 4: Palpatine, under the guise of Darth Sidious, orders Grievous to move all the Separatist leaders to the planet Mustafar, stating that the end of the war is near.Step 5: Palpatine then gives the news to Anakin as to where Grievous is hiding. So the Jedi send Obi-Wan to Utapau to capture or kill Grievous with a battalion of Clone troops.Step 6: After Obi-Wan engages Grievous, Mace Windu orders Anakin to deliver the news to Palpatine, as the Jedi were suspicious of Palpatine as of late. During the conversation between Anakin and Palpatine, Palpatine admits (more or less) that he is the Sith Lord and tries to convince Anakin that he can save Padm\u00e9 from dying in child birth if Anakin joins the dark side of the Force.Step 7: With Grievous dead, Mace is on the way to see to it that Palpatine returns the emergency powers to the Senate, but before he leaves, Anakin returns to Mace and informs him that Palpatine is the Sith Lord. Mace and three other Jedi councilmembers go to the Chancellor's office to arrest him. Predicting that Anakin would report him to the Jedi, Palpatine waits for and engages these Jedi in lightsaber combat, easily slaying the three accompanying Mace, in mere seconds. However, Palpatine is defeated by Mace (though he might have thrown the fight when sensing Anakin approaching). At that moment, Anakin enters and Palpatine appeals to him by appearing innocent, calling the Jedi traitors, and asking for Anakin's help. Mace continues with an arrest attempt, but Palpatine makes an enormous display of resistance which backfires yet is severe enough to alter Mace's intentions and possibly impress Anakin. Palpatine is cowering and begging for his life, at this point, but Mace is finally certain of Palpatine's being the elusive Darth Sidious, a man thus far of legend. Anakin pleads with Mace that due process should be followed, desperately (and unsuccessfully) attempting to hide his true motivation of needing Palpatine alive. When Mace decides Palpatine is too dangerous to be kept alive, as the Sith Lord has control over the senate and courts, he moves to kill Palpatine, but Anakin disarms Mace (literally), allowing Palpatine to strike the finishing blow. Anakin is devastated in the knowledge that he intentionally assisted with the slaying of a fellow Jedi, but Palpatine insists that Anakin merely intervened in a traitor's plot. Willing to believe this (and unable to further attempt arrest of the Sith menace), Anakin feels he now has no choice but to become Palpatine's new apprentice, even more so to gain Palpatine's help in saving Padm\u00e9's life. Palpatine then pronounces Anakin to henceforth be known as Darth Vader, and tells him they will work together to discover the secret of cheating death and living forever.Step 8: Having achieved a major victory, Palpatine freely dresses as his alter ego, Darth Sidious. Palpatine sends Darth Vader to the Jedi Temple with a garrison of clone troops to end the Jedi \"plot\" and kill every last Jedi, then afterwards orders him to go to Mustafar to kill Viceroy Nute Gunray and the other Separatist leaders. He adds that Vader show no hesitation or mercy, as his embracing of the dark side will grant him the powers needed to save his doomed wife.Step 9: Palpatine contacts Clone commanders around the galaxy, commanding them to \"Execute Order 66\" which was a pre-coded instruction to immediately execute every single Jedi with extreme prejudice, the Jedi to be regarded as being in \"rebellion.\" Being like living droids, the Clones do so without question.Step 10: Darth Sidious (with his eyes overshadowed as usual, but now having a gnarled face) mendaciously promises the Viceroy peace under the auspices of the Sith and instructs him to await Darth Vader's arrival.Step 11: Palpatine calls an emergency session of the Senate and elaborates on the \"attempt on his life\" by the Jedi that left him disfigured. He then announces his plan to turn the Republic \"into the first Galactic Empire, for a safe and secure society.\" Out of sympathy for his suffering and sacrifice, the Senate enthusiastically gives him their mandate, thus making him emperor of the galaxy for life and the Empire effectively a dictatorship. The Galactic Senate then becomes known as the Imperial Senate (as mentioned in Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977)), though has diminished power by that point.Step 12: After Darth Vader has slaughtered everybody at the Separatists hideout on Mustafar, he is ordered by his master to shut down all of the Separatists' droid units immediately, thus ending the Clone Wars.Step 13: Perhaps foreseeing that the Imperial Senate will one day object to his tyranny, the Emperor commissions the construction of the Death Star as a way to extort the systems into submission.",
            "Palpatine is, of course, referring to his own master, Darth Plagueis. In EU novels and comic books, an ancient Sith Lord named Darth Sion used the dark side of the Force to prevent himself from dying after sustaining fatal injuries (though this left him in great physical pain), dying only when he finally let go of his anger and hatred. Subsequent Sith achieved some success in preventing natural death, but fell in battle or were murdered by their own followers. Palpatine's own master, Darth Plagueis the Wise, was able to use the Force to prevent those close to him (like family members or friends) from dying, but unlike Sion, he could not use this power to save himself, as Palpatine murdered him in his sleep after Plagueis taught him \"everything he knew.\" Ultimately, Palpatine told this story to Anakin in the hopes that Anakin would assume that this power could be achieved through Palpatine. Once Anakin pledges himself to Palpatine, stating that he just wants help to save his wife from dying in childbirth, Palpatine says, \"To cheat death is a power only one has achieved. But if we work together, I know we can discover the secret,\" revealing he did not actually have this power to sustain eternal life after all. An ultimately deleted line from the opera scene had Palpatine concluding his discussion of Darth Plagueis's purported ability to save others from death with the observation that \"It was an ability for which his apprentice saw no value.\"",
            "In essence, this is true. The last time Anakin/Vader sees his wife, Padm\u00e9, he accused her of betraying him and started to telekinetically choke her. He releases her when Obi-Wan intervenes, and she falls to the ground unconscious. This is the last time Anakin would ever see Padm\u00e9. After his brutal duel with Obi-Wan, Vader is left horribly scarred and mutilated. Obi-Wan then goes to help the weakened Padm\u00e9, ensuring she reaches a medical facility where she gives birth to twins, Luke and Leia. Already in a weakened state before giving birth, Padm\u00e9 dies shortly after the twins are born. The medical droid attending to her states that she \"lost the will to live\", which is understandable after her devoted husband turned evil and deliberately harmed her amidst the crumbling of the Galactic Republic (along with the destruction of the Jedi Order). The Emperor saves Vader by having Vader's body reconstructed with artificial limbs and encasing him inside the infamous survival suit of black armor complete with a respirator that will sustain him. The first thing Vader asks when he regains his health in his new form is if Padm\u00e9 is alive and well. The Emperor says, \"It seems that, in your anger, you killed her.\" Although the Emperor would have been unaware that Padm\u00e9 had survived long enough to give birth to her children and was therefore not directly killed by Vader on Mustafar, the reason he says this is because, at this point, everything Anakin/Vader had done (including turning to the dark side of the Force) was to ensure Padm\u00e9's survival. The Emperor clearly knew that by telling Vader that he killed the woman he loved with his own hands (so to speak) would more or less purge Vader of any trace of humanity or compassion left in him, making him a powerful agent of the dark side of the Force.",
            "Anakin/Vader deliberately harmed Padm\u00e9 while she was pregnant by telekinetically choking her. Although Obi-Wan intervened before Vader could kill her, Padm\u00e9 still lost consciousness and the attack could well have led to complications later, on a psychological level if not a physical one. As the medic droid states \"Medically she's completely healthy. For reasons we can't explain, we are losing her... We don't know why. She has lost the will to live.\" People who are in frail health (elderly people, or those with significant pre-existing medical conditions) have often died after a trauma or loss in their lives. Padm\u00e9 and Anakin are quite in love and it was quite devastating to Padm\u00e9 that the man she loved had become evil and harmed her in his jealousy and rage. In addition, her loss coincided with the dissolution of galactic democracy as well as the extermination of the Jedi, Anakin in spirit among them.",
            "For security reasons surely. C-3PO is a protocol droid designed for extensive interaction with people, and he could easily but unintentionally divulge information that needs to kept secret from the Empire. Erasing all of C-3PO's memories of Anakin, Padm\u00e9, Bail, Obi-Wan and everything that happened to him throughout the events of Episodes I, II and III would therefore wipe the slate clean and allow him to serve a new master without ties to the old one. It is possible that C-3PO knew or heard that Padm\u00e9 had given birth before she died and, if Bail considered this a liability to the safety of the twins, he had the memory wiped more for that reason instead. Another important reason is that C-3PO also knows that Yoda, Obi-Wan, Bail and Captain Antilles have all conspired to hide the twins. The lives of all four (especially Organa and Antilles since they are not in hiding) would be at extreme danger, if this information would be exposed. Why Bail never opted to have R2-D2's memory wiped at the same time is not made clear, though it may be that Bail didn't think R2-D2 would pose a security risk to the twins or the conspirators, as astromech droids do not speak in a language that humans can understand (and is naturally less \"chatty\" than C-3PO is anyway). It is even possible that they leave R2-D2's memory intact intentionally, because they suspect that he may be a useful ally/tool in the future. Being an astromech droid, R2-D2 can be used to secretly store information and communicate it to others without drawing immediate suspicion, and he can be most helpful with this if he is aware of all the facts. Indeed, in Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977), R2-D2 receives the secret Death Star plans, and he is adamant to deliver them to Obi-Wan, seemingly aware of the importance of the plans and Obi-Wan to the Rebellion. (Luke even mentions that he had \"never seen such devotion in a droid before.\") The technical reason for the mind wipe, of course, is that George Lucas had to include the line in the film so as to explain why C-3PO does not know Obi-Wan or recognize the name \"Skywalker\" in A New Hope.",
            "In the novel Star Wars Aftermath: Empire's End, there is an interlude chapter which takes place on Naboo. In this chapter, it is revealed that Jar Jar was, in part, blamed for the rise of the Empire because he motioned to give immediate emergency powers to Chancellor Palpatine. Many people saw Jar Jar as a co-conspirator and felt he was partially responsible for Palpatine gaining total control over the Republic. As such, Jar Jar was again banished from Gunga city, and most of the Naboo people shunned him. He was reduced to being a court jester/street performer for the children orphaned in the galactic civil war.",
            "The clone troopers were genetically engineered to be totally obedient to Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, and their service to the Jedi is superseded by their service to the Supreme Chancellor. Having survived so many battles together, the Jedi and the clone troopers undoubtedly formed bonds, but those bonds were not strong enough for any clone trooper to disobey or question the Chancellor, even though a mass majority of the clone troopers never even met him in person. You could say that clone troopers were aware of the eventuality of Order 66 going into effect, since the Chancellor saw fit to sugarcoat his instruction to Commander Cody with the opening phrase \"the time has come\", but they weren't feigning friendship with the Jedi throughout the wars. The clone troopers probably mourned being betrayed by their friends, since the feeling of betrayal would be the inevitable emotion for the clone troopers to have rather than the feeling of guilt. Regardless, they are soldiers and thus meant to have limited empathy, even if most of their work involves destroying droids rather than sentient beings. Order 66 simply identified the Jedi, who are armed and extremely dangerous, as being in rebellion against the Galactic Republic, and the clone troopers didn't have the security and means to investigate the motivation for authoritative instructions to execute the order. Some level of paranoia about Jedi would likely be involved too, under the circumstances.In sixth season of the animated series Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008) (an interquel to Episodes II and III), however, as a deeper explanation of the clone troopers' backstabbing slaughter of the Jedi, it is revealed that every clone trooper has a \"structural inhibitor chip\"-a thought-altering cerebral neurochip-implanted in his cranium to reinforce what Kaminoan senior cloners deceitfully claim is nothing more than docility when, in truth, the chip is secretly also responsible for the clone trooper's dormant, subliminal, cavalier, lethal hostility toward Jedi: Conspiracy (2014), Fugitive (2014) and Orders (2014). In the canon Kanan comic book series from Marvel, a clone that turns on Kanan during Order 66 as ordered by the Emperor later comes to show regret for his actions, implying that the inhibitor chip is a form of \"mind control\" and that he (and by that extent, other clones) were not entirely in control of their actions during said order."

        "answers": [
            "Gregor, Sam and Deirdre make reference to \"the man from Bristol\" (also referred to as \"the man in the wheelchair\" and \"a man who doesn't work so well\"). His given name is never revealed. From what is mentioned in the film, he is apparently a retired intelligence agent who was paralyzed during the Cold War (what Sam calls \"the late unpleasantness\") and confined to a wheelchair. He currently works as a sort of employment agency for mercenaries. Dierdre hired both Sam and Gregor through the man from Bristol. His nationality is unknown but, presumably, he is not from a Soviet bloc country since, when Gregor asks how the man became paralyzed, Sam states that it occurred \"in your neck of the woods\" (i.e., East Germany or the Soviet bloc) and could have been the result of torture or being shot.",
            "The first thing Sam does upon meeting the other members of the team is to size everyone up. What are their strengths? Weaknesses? What might be their backgrounds? Vincent and Larry are more or less who they claim to be, with no pretensions about the job or their roles in it, and quickly earn his trust. Deirdre tries hard to assert her authority but clearly answers to someone else, which Sam repeatedly brings up to keep her off-balance, even as he becomes attracted to her. Gregor and Spence are harder to pin down, and so he decides to test both with a cup of coffee.Although Gregor was hired as the electronics man, his lightning fast reflexes when catching the falling cup suggest he possesses skills (and he belies a look of irritation at himself for falling for the coffee cup trick) beyond that. His knowledge of \"the man in the wheelchair\" and, possibly, what happened to him leads Sam to infer he worked in intelligence. However, he behaves professionally and Sam can respect his caginess; thus, he passes muster, for the moment.Spence claims to be the \"weapons man\" who served with the 22nd Special Air Service at Hereford. From the start he is loud and brash, giving orders and bragging about his training - not exactly professional but tolerable. At the weapons deal, however, Spence allows himself to be lured into an obvious trap, displays poor knowledge of combat tactics, and is unnerved by the gunfight, arousing Sam's suspicions. His \"trick\" for intercepting the convoy, which is exposed as tactically ludicrous, makes him even more suspect. When Sam tests him, his failure to react when \"ambushed\" by the cup of coffee makes clear he possesses no special training. Combined with the fact that he doesn't know the color of the boathouse at Hereford, or even try to bluff his way out of answering the question, and it becomes clear he's a fraud who would only jeopardize the team, leading to his dismissal.",
            "Spence is likely the one who set up the exchange. Vincent, being French and having connections in France, would probably have been able to make an arrangement with trustworthy sources. However, Spence claimed to be the \"weapons man\" and so was put in charge of procuring them. It's likely Spence is just a street-level criminal with some degree of connections, but lacking the knowledge or experience to properly vet his sources outside of England. Thus, he set up an exchange with an unreliable source who planned to rip the team off.As Sam notes, the location for the exchange is a tactical nightmare for his group, and the fact that the merchandise is not all there from the beginning, forcing them to wait until more men show up, makes him suspicious. As they approach the second group, the fat man can be heard saying in Russian, \"Let them come closer. Keep talking,\" which supports the theory that it was an ambush.When Sam asks Deirdre if her people have actually done business with the sellers or were just \"given a number,\" she makes a point of not answering. The fact that the exchange is such a disaster convinces Sam her operation is \"amateur hour,\" and he leverages that into a greatly increased fee for both himself and the other team members. So Spence's incompetence actually benefits everyone other than himself and Deirdre.",
            "After Spence's incompetence during the weapons exchange ambush, Sam interrupts his briefing and points out how bad his tactics are. He challenges Spence's claim that he was in the Special Air Service by asking him a trick question about the SAS HQ which Spence is unable to answer (\"What's the colour of the boathouse at Hereford?\"). Then he manages to physically overpower him and disarm him. Having been humiliatingly exposed as a fraud, Spence is dismissed from the team. Deirdre pays him for services rendered up to that point and hints that if he tells anyone about them, he'll be killed.",
            "The female sniper is most likely just another mercenary, perhaps one of Gregor's ex-KGB acquaintances. The identity of the sniper was probably another element of the plot that was purposely left out, just like The Man In The Wheelchair or the contents of the case that everyone is trying to steal. During World War II the Soviets often employed women as snipers, finding many to be well-suited to the job. A few other movies have made mention of Russian women snipers, such as Stalag 17 (1953) and The Living Daylights (1987), but mostly in passing. More info on the use of women snipers by the Soviets can be read here.",
            "The briefcase is a \"MacGuffin\"-a term popularized by director Alfred Hitchcock and writer Angus MacPhail to describe a plot point that is deliberately left vague so as not to draw too much emphasis away from the real story. What is known about the contents is\n(1) It is worth more than $800,000 (the maximum the Irish are willing to pay the mercenaries since they cannot afford to bid for it, and about the same amount that can fit in Gregor's briefcase at the end of the film);\n(2) It is wanted by both the Russians and the Irish, but neither is willing to pay for it;\n(3) It is small enough to fit inside an ice-skate case, and not too heavy to be handled by a variety of characters; and\n(4) It cannot be hazardous material, since Gregor was able to mail it to himself through the French postal system, who would check. Some speculations are\n(1) Important or stolen blueprints;\n(2) Printing plates for the new (at the time) Euro bills;\n(3) Important or stolen documents; and\n(4) The ice skate case belongs to the Russians and contains information that they want back. (Details of arms sales? Pictures of Mikhi with underage boys?) That's why Mikhi wants it back but doesn't want to pay for it; handing over money could validate the contents and be used to blackmail him later. The Irish want it as leverage over the Russians. The CIA want it to convict the Russians. The man with the case wants to sell it and make a quick buck."

            "Morpheus explains that while little detail is known about the apocalyptic end of the surface world, it is known that humans are the ones who blocked out the sun. Morpheus says that the machines were reliant on solar power and humans decided that the machines could be stopped by darkening the sky. When that happened, humans found themselves unable to grow food and live without the sun, which is our world's greatest source of energy, and so the Machines enslaved humans, using their body heat as a new energy source.The apocalyptic events that led to the destruction of Earth's habitable surface are documented in the Animatrix prequel short films. In one of them, Operation Dark Storm, the official name given to the plan, is explained.",
            "Agent Smith explains in the first film that the Machines' first attempts to control the human mind ended in failure. The first versions of the Matrix looked like a paradise, but the majority of people hooked to the Matrix rejected this reality as fake. The Machines 'lost entire crops', which probably meant that either those humans' minds and bodies perished (the body cannot exist without the mind is another Morpheus quote), or they started to revolt and died during altercations with Agents who tried to end the uprisings.Smith alleges that the first version of the Matrix may have failed because the Machines lacked the understanding of the human mind to create their idea of a perfect world, i.e. their version of paradise was not accurate enough for humans to accept. However, he dismisses this notion, suggesting instead that adversity and suffering are part of human life, so their world needed to reflect that. Hence the simulation of the world as it was in 1999.In part 2, the Architect adds that it was the Oracle who 'stumbled upon a solution whereby nearly 99% of the test subjects accepted the program provided they were given a choice'. This 'choice' means that they must be allowed to be freed from the Matrix if they choose to. 99% of the humans is perfectly happy inside the Matrix; 1% rejects the fake reality, seeks out like-minded people, and will eventually be disconnected from the Matrix to live in Zion.Apparently, the Machines have no way to predict who will reject the Matrix, otherwise they might consider eliminating those before they become rebellious. However, killing anyone as soon as they want to leave the Matrix may be impossible (the Agents apparently cannot keep total surveillance on everyone). It may be undesired as well: news of frequent killings will spread quickly throughout the Matrix, and only contribute to more unrest. Their solution is thus to allow those people to escape; as long as the freed humans are in Zion in limited numbers, they do not pose too much of a threat.So the Machines/Agents try to intimidate or eliminate the 1% who are wise to the Matrix (as shown by the Agents interrogating Neo with threats early in the first film), but as you can see, they are not always successful. Ironically, this treatment may also be part of the Matrix' design, to help the 1% make the choice to reject their reality, and try to escape.",

            "The idea being that the One is both organic and code at the same time, and the One is an inherited position and a necessarily reoccurring part of the Matrix.",
            "The second and third films show that the machines are actively hunting the humans that have escaped the Matrix and/or live in Zion. They also try to stop those who become aware of the Matrix before they escape, but aren't always successful.",
            "Agents, such as Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), are intelligent security programs, which over-write the digital 'bodies' of humans connected bodily to the Matrix, but cannot do the same to the heroes of the story, who connect to the Matrix through radio signals. Agents are the gatekeepers of the Matrix, while Sentinels (search and destroy vessels) are the gatekeepers of the machine-occupied regions of the world outside of the Matrix.",
            "The Art of the Matrix's script notes on an extended version of this scene confirm the fan theory that Cypher rigged the system to connect him to the Matrix automatically while the others were busy elsewhere. This is why he jumps so much when Neo surprises him. Cypher casually but quickly turns off several screens, including three that have real time imagery instead of the Matrix code. This would likely be so that the inquisitive Neo wouldn't ask him about it.",
            "The Oracle (Gloria Foster) never explicitly tells Neo that he is not the One, in fact, Neo says it. She expresses sorrow that he seems to be \"waiting for something.\" He can't be told he is \"the One\", he has to believe it; much like what Morpheus had been alluding to during the training sequence.The Oracle was a program used to investigate the human psyche. she discovered that humans could be kept alive and asleep as long as they at least subconsciously believed they had a choice. Everything she did was manipulation to achieve the grand scheme of steering Neo toward the architect while letting them think they were actually controlling their own destiny. The Matrix (and life) is all about control vs choice.",
            "Morpheus says, \"The body cannot live without the mind\"; but they appear to die of the shock of a sudden disconnection. It's likely that the disconnect forms some sort of data corruption between the user's mind and the Matrix, and as a result the user's central nervous system suffers irreparable damage. Even in real life, when users transfer a file from a computer to a portable hard drive, and sever the connection before the transfer is complete, the file will be damaged and useless. Something similar is implied here.",
            "He doesn't want the other Agents to know what he's saying to Morpheus. The Agents seem to operate collectively, finishing each others' sentences at times and certainly knowing what each is thinking. Smith's actions may largely be symbolic to show that he's able to turn this collective consciousness off and, in this case, has a reason to. His discussion with Morpheus implies that he is much more \"human\" than his colleagues: he shows frustration, exhaustion, impatience, and hatred for the Matrix itself and his place in it.",
            "Pursued in the Matrix by the three Agents, Neo races for the exit at the Heart O' the City Hotel, room 303. The moment he gets inside, however, Agent Smith empties his gun into his chest. Neo slumps to the floor as, back in the Nebuchadnezzar, Trinity, Tank, and Morpheus watch incredulously as Neo's body flatlines. As the Sentinels continue to break through the hull of the ship, Trinity whispers into Neo's ear that the Oracle told her that she would fall in love with the One, so Neo must be the One because \"I love you,\" she says and kisses him. Neo suddenly begins to breathe. At the same time, he awakens in the Matrix now knowing that he is, indeed, the One. When the Agents empty their guns at him, he stops the bullets in mid-air. When Agent Smith tries to attack him, Neo easily bests him and takes over his body, destroying him. The other two agents run away, and Neo transports back to the ship just as Morpheus orders the electromagnetic pulser (EMP) to be engaged, destroying the attacking Sentinels. In the final scene, as the blank screen fills with system prompts and a grid of numbers, a voiceover by Neo says, \"I know you're out there. I can feel you now. I know that you're afraid... you're afraid of us. You're afraid of change. I don't know the future. I didn't come here to tell you how this is going to end. I came here to tell you how it's going to begin. I'm going to hang up this phone, and then I'm going to show these people what you don't want them to see. I'm going to show them a world without you. A world without rules and controls, without borders or boundaries. A world where anything is possible. Where we go from there is a choice I leave to you.\" In the Matrix world, Neo hangs up the phone. He looks at the masses around him, puts on his glasses, looks up, and takes flight.",
            "The brain does not die immediately when heart and respiration stops. Neo was almost the One, he'd not been affected by the first bullet, until he saw his blood. So, his mind was almost to the point of disbelieving the illusion of the Matrix-that he should be injured by bullets. He could feel Trinity's kiss or hear her words, somehow, which reminds him that the Matrix is not real-that his injury is not real.",
            "Now that he truly believes he is the One, Neo is beginning to use his consciousness over the Matrix. He can now see the Matrix for what it is, and this will lead to additional abilities to manipulate it as he sees it.",
            "Neo is talking (possibly metaphorically) to the Machine mainframe. He's talking to the Source, to the power behind the Machines, to whatever sends the Agents after him. And he's telling it/them that he's done running, that he can defeat them and because of that the best for both sides is that the Machines simply stop attacking humanity.",
            "They need the access to the human mind: it fuels the story line. If this was an animal-induced world, it would be pretty far behind technologically. Based on all available information about the setting of the Matrix movies, the easiest explanation to accept would be that too few animals are left alive after the war between humans and the Machines. However, in \"Matriculated\", an segment of The Animatrix (2003), a monkey named Baby is depicted with functional implants for jacking into simulations, evidence that the Machines could indeed insert some animals into the Matrix. Scientifically, the whole premise that Machines need to harvest human body heat to survive is dubious at best. For one thing, there's no adequate explanation of how the humans are kept alive. (Feeding them the liquid corpses wouldn't be enough.) Furthermore, other forms of fusion would probably prove more efficient. At the Machines' level of technology, solar power could still be an option, despite the sun being blocked off. Fans have proposed some alternate explanations for why people are kept alive in the Matrix. One intriguing idea is that the Machines cannot artificially replicate certain qualities of biological sentience/sapience and are secretly using human brains as CPUs; or, actually lack sufficient numbers of their own kind for adequate processing power, until the end of the trilogy. Otherwise, it is conceivable that the human race is being preserved for conservationist, ethical, sadistic or sentimental reasons."

            "Actually, he just shot his cheek, that's why he survived, it's hella painful, but that's how it is.",
            "As astute viewers will have observed, Tyler Durden appears in the film six times prior to the scene where the Narrator meets him on the plane. Four of these appearances are single-frame flashes, which director David Fincher refers to on his DVD commentary as \"subliminal Brads\" (a single frame is 1/24 of a second in duration, just slow enough for the human eye to register). The first subliminal Brad appears while the Narrator is standing at the photocopier at work, trying to stay awake; the second appears as the doctor (Richmond Arquette) tells the Narrator that to see what real pain is, he needs to attend the testicular cancer support group; the third as the support group leader (George Maguire) makes his opening remarks; and the fourth as the Narrator watches Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) walk down an alley. Durden's fifth and sixth appearances are not single-frame flashes but cameo appearances: he is the furthest waiter on the right in the hotel welcome video and a passerby on a walkway in an airport.On his DVD commentary track, David Fincher explains that the idea behind the subliminal Brads was to convey a sense of exasperation on the part of Tyler Durden; it is as if the Narrator has already created Tyler, but is hesitating to release him. The subliminal Brads are an attempt to illustrate Tyler's frustration with the Narrator-if the Narrator would simply allow him free reign, Tyler could tackle many of the problems holding the Narrator back. Significantly, all four subliminal Brads appear at times of stress, as if Tyler is choosing these precise moments to remind the Narrator that a solution is within his grasp, he just needs to follow through with it.",
            "Yes he did, whilst in the guise of Tyler; prior to the car crash near the end of the film, Tyler Durden reveals that he blew up the Narrator's apartment. However, as we subsequently discover, Tyler is simply a figment of The Narrator's imagination, so the implication is that the Narrator blew up his own apartment, whilst in the Tyler persona. The problem some viewers have with this concerns the question of when he may have done it. After the Narrator loses his suitcase in the airport, he goes straight home to find his apartment on fire, prompting some to suggest he had no time to destroy the apartment. Similarly, when Detective Stern (Thom Gossom Jr.) of the Arson Unit calls, he says freon was sprayed into the condo's front-door lock and the cylinder shattered with a chisel. He then says that the gas was probably just used as a detonator for home-made dynamite (to which Tyler has already alluded, when he met the Narrator on the plane for the first time). As Stern makes no mention of a timer, one must assume that after the plane landed, Tyler became \"active\", left to blow up the condo, and then got into a cab somewhere. Then the Narrator's personality reasserted itself some time prior to his own arrival back at the apartment. This is partly supported by the theory that the scene depicting the Narrator attempting to retrieve his lost suitcase may itself be imagined, and in reality, he is actually in the process of blowing up the apartment, and covering it up from himself with this imagined scene. Evidence for this interpretation is provided by the fact that Tyler is seen jumping into a convertible in the background, prompting someone to yell at him, \"that's my car,\" indicating that Tyler is really stealing a car. Obviously, as a figment of the Narrator's imagination, Tyler could not do such a thing (which David Fincher acknowledges on the commentary track), and hence the Narrator could be imagining the entire scene so as to cover up his own actions.",
            "Due to the graphic nature of the gunshot at the end of the film, many viewers believe that the Narrator actually kills himself and therefore only \"imagines\" the last few moments of the film as he dies. Director David Fincher does acknowledge on his DVD commentary that the gunshot causes confusion because it is so outrageous, appearing to actually go through the Narrator's jaw. However, the Narrator is depicted as supposedly having suffered no serious injury, and importantly, if you look at the scene closely, you can see the bullet ricochet off his jaw and bounce back out of his mouth, thus explaining why the apparently fatal injury was not in fact fatal. In the novel, the Narrator's face is much more grotesque than in the movie as he already has a hole in his face due to the fight with Tyler. The gunshot then hits the other side of his face, causing another hole, which connects with the original hole, creating a huge, Joker-like grin.To examine the scene further, there are all sorts of theories as to the symbolism of the gunshot and its effect, primarily in relation to the death of Tyler. Some argue that the gunshot was the Narrator's final way of \"hitting bottom\" as Tyler wanted, so therefore Tyler ceased to exist, as he was no longer needed. By attempting suicide, the Narrator is obviously no longer afraid of death or pain (which is what Tyler is trying to teach him during the scene where he pours lye on his hand). For this reason, Tyler's role becomes obsolete, because the Narrator had only created Tyler initially so as to express the more reckless nature which he had tried to repress. Others argue that the gunshot represents the Narrator's absolute rejection of Tyler, thus killing him. This is based on the concept that the bullet did in fact pass through the Narrator's head, but since he was two people, it was Tyler who was killed and not the Narrator (hence the exit wound in the back of Tyler's head). In this sense, it is significant to note that the affliction from which the Narrator seems to be suffering, dissociative identity disorder (DID), has been known to be \"cured\", or otherwise eradicated, if the patient experiences a traumatic event; receiving a gunshot to the face undoubtedly counts as a traumatic event. Another possibility is that the bullet went through a portion of the Narrator's brain, causing a pseudo-lobotomy and removing the \"Tyler\" part of his consciousness. Yet another argument is that rather than Tyler dying and the Narrator surviving, the two characters merge. After the gunshot, the Narrator has clearly become a different person, evidenced primarily by the fact that he stops denying his feelings for Marla. Additionally, the flash of the penis just before the credits would seem to support the idea that Tyler is still alive \"somewhere\", hence the merging theory."

Then, while holding off Renard's men, he attempts to make the submarine surface so that it will be detected on navy radar but instead makes it dive deeper, causing the sub to hit bottom. As the submarine begins to flood with water, Bond and Christmas work their way toward the hatch, until Christmas notices that Renard has locked himself in the reactor room and is attempting to load the plutonium rod, which will set off an explosion that will destroy Istanbul. To get to the reactor room, Bond exits through one escape hatch and then re-enters the sub through the escape hatch in the reactor room. Once inside, he opens the door for Christmas to gain entrance to the reactor room and, together, they try to stop Renard from inserting the plutonium rod. Just as it looks like Renard is going to win, Bond reconnects a blown pressure hose, causing the reactor to backfire and eject the plutonium rod, which impales Renard through the chest. The reactor floods with water, and Bond and Christmas escape by ejecting themselves out through a torpedo tube. As they swim to the surface, the submarine safely blows up underwater. Back at MI6 headquarters in Scotland, M (who has returned safely from Azerbaijan) asks if there's been any word from Bond, who is still in Istanbul sharing champagne with Christmas. R (John Cleese), Q (Desmond Llewelyn)'s understudy, manages to pick up Bond with his thermal imaging card. When the MI6 staff realizes what Bond and Christmas are really doing, R discretely flicks off the image."

            "The Evenstar pendant is a tangible symbol for her immortality. Her giving it to Aragorn symbolises her decision to give up an eternal life of bliss in the beautiful Undying Lands with her family and her people, and instead to remain in the chaotic and ordinary world, with all its pain and suffering, to stay with the man she loves. In the movies a vision is shown where the Evenstar shatters and at some point Aragorn loses the pendant (though it is later returned to him), both of those events symbolise Arwen's mortality and her power which will eventually diminish. The Evenstar pendant was actually invented for the movies, it doesn't exist in the books (in fact, 'Evenstar' was actually just a title given to Arwen in the books).",
            "Because he was dead. Did you even watch the movie?",
            "The most likely answer is because they wanted to take Sauroman prisoner to gain any information he might have. Theoden tries to get Grima to re-join the forces of good. Instead, Grima stabs Sauroman in the back, so Legolas shoots Grima with an arrow. Either in an attempt to save Sauroman, as they needed the information he possessed. Or simply because Grima made his choice to stay on Sauron's side by killing someone with valuable information against him.",

            "Arwen, like her father (and brothers) is considered to be a Half-Elf, the result of a union between an Elf and a mortal human. The Half-Elven of Middle-earth get a choice, to remain immortal and return to the West (Valinor) or to become mortal and to die as humans do. Elrond chose to remain an Elf. Arwen (like her uncle Elros) chooses to become mortal in order to wed and remain with Aragorn. Elrond senses this; this is what he means when he says that Arwen is dying. It is the same as in The Last Unicorn, when the unicorn is given the form of a human woman and can feel that she is no longer immortal (\"I can feel this body dying all around me\"). According to Tolkien, though, after Aragorn dies in the year 120 (Fourth Age), Arwen returns to L\u00f3rien, where she dies by choice the following winter.",
            "The novel states Shelob stung Frodo in the neck, not in the chest as depicted in the film: \"Shelob with hideous speed had come behind and with one swift stroke had stung him in the neck.\" (The Choices of Master Samwise) While we see Shelob impales Frodo in the front with her stinger, we don't see exactly where he was stung. We only see a close-up of Frodo's face while being stung. He could have been stung in the leg, the inner-thigh, or other areas the vest doesn't cover. There are two wounds visible on Frodo's chest; one from the Morgul Blade suffered during the battle at Weathertop. The other is the wound left after the cavetroll stabbed him in Moria.Another possibility is that perhaps the stinger had a protrusion at the tip that was small and needle-like. Which allowed it to pierce between the links in the mithril.",
            "In myth and legend, unlike real life, kings were measured by nobility and the honoring of commitments. Aragorn commanded the army of the dead to fulfill their oath by helping him with one battle. Any attempt to send them into another battle would have backfired. He showed his worthiness by honoring his word even though it might have seemed easier to try and do otherwise. Also, the ghosts couldn't kill Sauron. At most they could have given him a fight. From the author's perspective, it would have been too easy of a solution and rendered Tolkien's Eucatastrophe meaningless, a Hobbit, the unlikeliest of creatures, defeating Sauron. From a story standpoint, it would have been a shortcut that would have made the overall story suffer.The ghost army was hardly as powerful in the book as they were in movie. In fact in the book, as with most ghosts and wraiths throughout the book they have very little power (except for the Nazgul, i.e. Ring Wraiths, the most powerful ghosts in the story). In fact all they can really do is scare people, as they do in the book when the Dead Army serve their purpose and scare the Corsairs off their ships. It is these ships which Aragorn commandeers with the D\u00fanedain and the garrison force of Pelargir (the city where the Corsair ships have just taken). While maybe not as cool as seeing a Ghost Army waft over the army of Mordor and kill everyone, in the book the actual point of the whole story is that the time of elves and dwarves is gone and the War of the Ring ushers in the Fourth Age of Middle-earth or the Age of Men. And so it is just three representatives of the former (Legolas, Elladan, and Elrohir) and one of the later (Gimli) who help the Rohirrim, the D\u00fanedain, and the Gondorians, all of which are men who defeat the army of Mordor and Harad.",
            "Frodo would not have given it to Sam, and Sam knew that. Earlier, Frodo told Sam, \"I must carry this burden to the end. It can't be altered. You can't come between me and this doom.\" From the book, just before Sam says, \"I can't carry it for you\", there's this: Sam knew before he spoke, that it was vain, and that such words might do more harm than good, but in his pity he could not keep silent. \"Then let me carry it a bit for you, Master,\" he said. \"You know I would, and gladly, as long as I have any strength.\"A wild light came into Frodo's eyes. \"Stand away! Don't touch me!\", he cried, \"It is mine, I say. Be off!\" His hand strayed to his sword-hilt. But then quickly his voice changed. \"No, no, Sam,\" he said sadly. \"But you must understand. It is my burden, and no one else can bear it. It is too late now, Sam dear. You can't help me in that way again. I am almost in its power now. I could not give it up, and if you tried to take it I should go mad.\" When Sam says, \"I can't carry the Ring for you\", this response from Frodo is motivating him. To even suggest he carry the Ring has highly distressed Frodo. To push the matter or to force it, would likely drive him mad.",
            "Just something Peter Jackson made up for cinematic effect. What happened according to the novel was this: (From The Return of the King, The Field of Cormallen): \"...the creatures of Sauron, orc or troll or beast spell-enslaved, ran hither and thither mindless; and some slew themselves, or cast themselves in pits, or fled wailing back to hide in holes and dark lightless places far from hope.\" Also, in the novel, violent earthquakes tore through much of Mordor, so Jackson could have be incorporating that into his film. The cracking of the earth does indeed coincide with the eruption of Mount Doom. Perhaps when Sauron was destroyed, his lands were destroyed along with him, as if anything over which he held power (buildings and lands) was also destroyed. We do know that Orcs were created from corrupted Elves, and in the prologue of Fellowship of the Ring we saw how the Orc army seemed to dissolve when Sauron's Ring was cut from his hand. Since Sauron can use the Ring's power to rule over others, it may be reasonable to assume that when the source of power is taken away or destroyed, everything that the power controls or brought about is also eliminated. This does not explain why the Orcs don't \"dissolve\" at the end, so perhaps this means that they were not created with the Ring's power, only persuaded and enslaved by it.",
            "According to the book, Frodo leaves Bag End on September 23rd and reaches Mount Doom on March 25th of the following year. So that's six months. But, there were long stays in Rivendell and Lorien (three months, total) so the actual journey was substantially less.In a voiceover in the film, Frodo says it's \"thirteen months to the day.\"",
            "Frodo (Elijah Wood) didn't have to leave at all. He chose to depart from his home because he couldn't settle back into his old life. The Shire folk pride themselves on the ignorance of problems outside of their homeland. The corruption of the ring, the near-fatal wound from the Witch King, and his newfound knowledge of the fragility of his little community left him with an outlook on the world that couldn't be covered by the formerly peaceful and blissfully ignorant life-style of the Shire folk. He was unable to heal emotionally from his experiences, as the wound he received from the Witch King never fully healed and caused him intense pain from time-to-time, as well as flashbacks of the event. Frodo eventually died a true death, as the Undying Lands cannot make mortal beings, such as men or hobbits, into immortal beings. In the director's commentary on the dvd, Peter Jackson says that departing to the West is a metaphor for death. Remember what Galadri\u00ebl (Cate Blanchett) said to Lord Elrond in The Two Towers about Frodo: \"The quest will claim his life.\" While the quest did not kill Frodo physically, it did end life for him as he knew it in Middle-earth.",
            "Although the film shows the departure of only Frodo, Bilbo (Ian Holm), and Gandalf, other members of the fellowship are known to have traveled to the West. Legolas also made the journey, taking with him Gimli (the only Dwarf allowed to sail to Valinor). Samwise left after Rosie died and he had served seven consecutive terms as mayor of Hobbiton. He was allowed to make the journey because he was, for a short time, also a ring-bearer. Aragorn served his term as King and then died a natural death. His son, Eldarion, took up his mantle of King. Merry and Pippin never went over the sea. They died at Minas Tirith and were buried in the tombs of the kings, and later placed next to Aragorn when he died.",
            "According to one of Tolkien's published letters, Shadowfax \"certainly went with Gandalf across the Sea\".",
            "Sauron's physical form is not seen in the film, only his eye which rests on the top of the tower of Barad-Dur. However, the 4-disc special edition DVD set has a documentary that has original footage of Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) fighting Sauron (Sala Baker). He also appears very briefly in the scene where Pippin (Billy Boyd) looks into the Palantir. He is in the same form as shown in the first film's backstory. The filmmakers originally wanted to give Sauron a more active role at the end, as opposed to the static eye on top of the tower that he was in the previous films. The confrontation originally started with Aragorn walking out of the group towards the Black Gate, as he sees a ghostly apparition of Sauron in his original form, a handsome, young, long-haired man - Annatar, the \"Lord of Gifts.\" The group would then become surrounded by Orcs, the giant armoured Sauron among them, who would battle with Aragorn. In the finished film, it is Sauron's eye on the tower calling to him, at which Aragorn is looking. In the documentary, Jackson discusses the reasons that Sauron was later replaced with a computer generated troll who battles Aragorn instead (he felt that the scene didn't ultimately work, as it reduced the struggles of the group and Frodo in particular to an Aragorn vs. Sauron match).",
            "Peter Jackson stated that to include the Mouth of Sauron would be pointless, as the audience already knows that what he is saying is not true. In the book, the fates of Frodo and Sam had not yet been disclosed at that point, lending dramatic tension to the confrontation that would necessarily be absent from the film version. In the Extended Edition, the Mouth of Sauron makes a brief appearance when he tries to trick the Fellowship into thinking Sauron killed Frodo and took the Ring. Aragorn refuses to believe this and subsequently kills the Mouth. Although the scene cannot convey the dramatic revelation of Frodo's \"death\", it was reinstated into the Extended Edition because it still works on another level: the (false) knowledge of Frodo's death gives more meaning to Aragorn's emotional line \"For Frodo\" and the sacrifice that he and his army are making.",
            "Ownership of the Ring gave Bilbo unnatural youth, just as it did to Sm\u00e9agol/Gollum (who is over 500 years old). Once he gave the Ring away, Bilbo began to age as he should have. (Bilbo's age at the end is based upon the timeline in the books, though in the film versions there is nothing to indicate that seventeen years passed between Bilbo's departure and Gandalf's return; his age in the film version may be closer to 114, though it is never specified either way except by Peter Jackson in a commentary track in the extended edition of The Fellowship of the Ring). It is not clear why Gollum is still alive, having lost the Ring 60 years ago, but it may be assumed that it gave him permanent strength because he had it for so long, or he was able to live on because his desire to take back the Ring was so strong. Also, we see that Bilbo had aged a bit from the time he left the shire to when Frodo met him again at Rivendell. However, he seems to have aged rapidly at the end of the film. It's likely that he didn't start aging quickly until the ring was destroyed. This would also explain why Gollum never aged. Both due to his 500-year relationship with the ring and the fact that the ring still existed when it left him. Since Gollum died with the ring, we won't know for sure, but it's possible he would have withered and died very quickly.",
            "The answer comes in the The Two Towers, the Voice of Saruman: \"I am Gandalf the White, who has returned from death. You have no colour now, and I cast you from the order and from the Council.\" He raised his hand, and spoke slowly in a clear cold voice. \"Saruman, your staff is broken.\" So, Gandalf breaking Saruman's staff was symbolic of the fact that (1) Gandalf now had authority over him, and (2) that Saruman was cast out of the order (of wizards) and the Council (the White Council of Wizards and High Elves).",
            "The main reason is a combination of storytelling decisions and changes that were made while adapting the books to the movies. The novel of The Two Towers describes the Battle for Helm's Deep, but from there it also continues with Aragorn and Gandalf traveling to Isengard in order to confront Saruman and retrieving the Palant\u00edr; it ends with Gandalf and Pippin's journey to Minas Tirith. This works perfectly well on paper, because it serves to set up the storylines of the third book. For the movie, however, it was decided to make the Battle for Helm's Deep the film's cinematic climax; Director Peter Jackson has explained in several making-of documentaries that continuing the story from there with a lengthy epilogue would have felt extremely anti-climatic and disappointing. So the decision was made fairly early on to move the Isengard confrontation and journey to Minas Tirith to the beginning of the third movie. This also led to the decision of including Saruman's death in the beginning of the third movie (in the book, it occurred at the end of the third book, but this was also changed, because it would have felt anti-climactic following after the epic battle at the Black Gate).However, a problem emerged there; the theatrical version of Return of the King needed to cover a lot of story elements and a fitting conclusion to the entire trilogy, and it ran already over three hours long. So Jackson did not want to waste time and preferred to get the story on the move as quickly as possible. He felt that the scene at Isengard seemed like an unnecessary aftermath from a previously concluded story, which stalled the movie too much; the Saruman confrontation provided mainly character development and few new information that the plot needed, and Jackson felt that Saruman's defeat had already been shown in the previous movie. But since the scene also reintroduced the Palant\u00edr (the catalyst for the next act), and reunited Gandalf and Aragorn with Merry and Pippin again, it could not be omitted entirely.Jackson re-edited the entire Isengard sequence several times, but he never got the desired pacing, nor was he able to convey the necessity of the scene. Another possible reason may have been that the movie's post-production, with a rapidly approaching premiere date, was an extremely rushed experience, perhaps forcing the decision to heavily cut the scene and fine-tune it later for the DVD edition. So it was decided to leave Saruman's fate out of the theatrical edition altogether. The choice was not without controversy; Tolkien fans balked at the decision, and Christopher Lee publicly voiced his objection. There was a small consolation: since Jackson had considerably fewer concerns with the pacing of the DVD version (where people can watch at their own leisure, and would expect him to take it slower and go deeper into the story and characters), he had no objections to putting the full scene back into the Extended Edition.",
            "Peter Jackson claims this ending would be anticlimactic. So let us examine this point by point.Jackson's ending takes approximately fifteen minutes to show Hobbits jumping up and down on a bed, strolling into Hobbiton like nothing happened, and Gandalf suddenly telling Frodo to come along at the sailing of the ships.The real ending has Arwen telling Frodo that if his injuries in his quest still pain him too much, he may take her place on the ships to Valinor. This makes it an active choice on her part, as opposed to the passive being told by Elrond that the door is closed to her now.When Frodo and his companions return to find Hobbiton and the Shire having been converted into a semi-industrial complex by a depowered Saruman, Saruman, now going by \"Sharkey\", greets Frodo with a load of waffling. Said waffling ends in him being very violently killed by Gr\u00edma, who in turn is killed by Hobbit archers. Saruman's spirit rises from his corpse and turns to the West. The Valar send an enormous gust of wind, a powerful rebuke and statement that he is no longer welcome in the West. He sighs and dissipates. Tolkien is very clear about Saruman being left to wander the Earth, unable to take form or interact with anything, until the Earth ends.This is what Peter Jackson calls anticlimactic."

Many if not most of the Elven force led by Haldir was killed before the breaching of the wall, due to them being used as frontline infantry due to their superior archery and combat skills. Moments before Haldir dies, he sees countless Elven corpses (which resulted from the skirmish after the breaching of the wall), which implies that all of the Elves have been killed, the majority of which would have died when the wall was breached.",

While relapsing into his murderous delusional state again, he ponders a way to get rid of Frodo and Sam, and mentions that he could let \"her\" do it. Gollum hopes that by luring Frodo and Sam unknowingly into Shelob's lair, the spider will kill both Hobbits for him, and he can retrieve the Ring. Shelob originally featured in the second book, The Two Towers, but she was moved to the third movie due to narrative difficulties and time constraints. The reference to her made by Gollum was probably intended to build some tension toward the final movie, and also serves as a note to the fans of what is coming. The Extended Edition of the movie contains an extra scene at the end where Frodo and Sam say goodbye to Faramir, and share their intention to enter Mordor through the pass at Cirith Ungol. Upon hearing this, Faramir immediately warns them of a dark terror that lurks there, again building tension that Frodo and Sam are walking into a trap set by Gollum."

After the big twist at the end of the movie where it is revealed that Malcolm was dead, it becomes very evident that the real reason Cole was running away from him was because seeing a ghost abruptly waiting for him outside his house frightened him.",
            "Shyamalan uses red for important scenes in all of his movies. Inside the door with the red door knob is Malcolm's study room. As explained in the film, ghosts only see what they want to see. Malcolm therefore saw himself as being unable to open the door for no apparent reason. However, at the end we see that his wife Anna has barricaded it with a table.",
            "As Cole explains partway through the film, the ghosts are not fully aware of their surroundings. Sometimes they're stuck acting out elements of their lives, or deaths. Malcolm Crowe seems to be more fully developed than some of the ghosts, but he also doesn't know that he's dead. He's not living through his life 24 hours a day like a living person would. Instead he sort of fades in and out at different times. So he takes his wife's silence (and her possible romantic interest in another man) as a sign of their failing marriage, not that he's dead. We see a direct reference to Malcolm's selective awareness in the climactic scene where he finally realizes he's dead. Throughout the movie, Malcolm has had difficulty opening the door to his basement office. Malcolm, and the viewer, initially think that the handle is merely stuck. But in the climactic scene, Malcolm realizes the truth, that he can't open the door because his wife has blocked it off with a table. He just never saw that before. In the film, we see a couple of scenes of Malcolm working in his office, but we never actually see him open the door and enter his office. That's because he doesn't do it. He just appears in the office when he needs to."

            "Harry, Marion, Tyrone and finally Sara are each shown curling into a fetal position for their final scene; a symbol of how their lives have been lost in complete ruin and despair. Harry and Tyrone are in prison, with Tyrone subject to hard work detail under harsh supervision by racist guards, and Harry's arm amputated at the shoulder; Marion has a new regular drug supplier, but she must pay for her drugs through sexual favors, and Sara is trapped in her psychosis-induced world of appearing on the Tappy Tibbons infomercial and presenting a successful, engaged Harry to an adoring audience.By seeing all the characters being in a fetal position can be interpreted as a metaphor for how helpless they all are. It also makes the viewers realize what drug can do to you and how helpless you can get. So the moral of the movie is nothing else than: Don't do drugs."

            "A Sick Stick and a Taser are essentially the same concept: a device driven into the victim's body, to render it shocked and immobile. The film merely fictionalizes the idea, to suggest a (marginally) more refined technology, and to evade copyright violations.",

            "This film is loosely based on the short story \"The Minority Report\" by Philip K. Dick. There are some differences between the book and the movie:1. The story is set in New York City, while the film uses the backdrop of Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Maryland and northern Virginia.2. PreCrime is a government branch in the story and a police department in the movie.3. In the story, John Anderton is a 50-year-old balding, out-of-shape police officer who created PreCrime, while in the movie Anderton is in his late 30s, handsome, small, athletic, with a full head of hair, who joined PreCrime after his son's kidnapping.4. Anderton in the story is older than his wife Lisa, while Anderton in the movie is younger than his wife Lara, who by the time of the events in the movie had left him because he reminded her of her son.5. The precogs were originally named Mike, Donna, and Jerry, and were deformed and mentally impaired. In the film, they are called Agatha, Dashiell and Arthur after crime-story writers Agatha Christie, Dashiell Hammett and Arthur Conan Doyle. They are children of drug addicts, thier mutations made them to dream of future murders, which are captured by machines. They are \"deified\" by the PreCrime officers, and are implied to be intelligent (Agatha guides Anderton successfully through a crowded mall while being pursued by PreCrime, and the trio are seen reading large piles of books at the end of the film). In the end of the movie they retire to a rural cottage where they continue their lives in freedom and peace.6. In the short story, Anderton's future victim is General Leopold Kaplan, who wants to discredit PreCrime in order to get more financing for the military. At the end of the story, Anderton kills him to prevent the destruction of PreCrime. In the movie, Anderton is supposed to kill someone named Leo Crow, but later finds out Crow is just a part of a set-up to prevent Anderton from discovering a different murder committed years ago by his superior, Lamar Burgess. At the end of the film, Anderton confronts Burgess, who commits suicide and sends PreCrime into oblivion.7. In the short story, Anderton seeks the precogs to hear their \"minority reports\". In the movie, Anderton kidnaps a female precog in order to discover her own \"minority report\" and extract the information about a mysterious crime.8. The short story ends with Anderton and Lisa moving to a space colony after Kaplan's murder. The movie finishes with the couple reunited after the conspiracy's resolution, expecting their second child.",
            "It's assumed, although the film doesn't explain, that the Temple uses different security than the system we see around the city. Clearly Anderton would be an expert on the Temple and the ways to bypass the security, so he was able to gain entry. It's also possible that there was a human error made in terms of assuming that Anderton would be caught before getting to the Temple, so his access wasn't cancelled.  Also, since Lamar is the Director of PreCrime, he could have made sure Anderton still had security clearance, since he was framing John and might have deduced that Anderton would try to break in to get at the precogs.There is, however, an inescapable continuity error near the end of the film when Lara uses John's eye to access the prison system where John is being sequestered. It is true that John was under arrest, making it unnecessary to remove his clearance. The authorities would be aware that his real eyes were never recovered after having them switched out, however, and it's extremely unlikely that they wouldn't remove the clearance as a precaution, especially given the increased scrutiny the department was under after the incidents in the film.",
            "The precogs see Leo's murder because John had decided (as he states later to Agatha after seeing the picture of his son on Crow's bed) years earlier he was going to murder the man who took his son from him if he ever found him. But this does not explain how the Precogs could already see the murder, if it was this premonition itself that caused John to look for Crow and kill him; in short, the murder seems to be caused by its own prediction (a self-fulfilling prophecy paradox often seen in many time-travel movies).There are ways out of this paradox. Let us assume there was also another reason or clue that would have ended in the murder. Lamar Burgess may have initially set out a trail for John, an important piece of evidence that would have led to John finding Crow over the course of a few days or so. This would cause a premonition that John would see days before, of him killing Crow, but because this murder would occur on another day, it would differ from the premonition seen in the movie in certain details; the time of day could be different, the man on the billboard seen outside the window wouldn't be there, Agatha would not be present, etc. It is actually this premonition that would provide John with early clues of the place and circumstances of the murder. This, in turn, would cause him to get Agatha and find and kill Crow much sooner than he would normally have done without seeing a premonition. So what happens is that John's normal or 'spontaneous' future is replaced with an alternate future that we see in the movie; and, to make it more complicated: it is finally a premonition of this alternate future that John sees in the movie.There is also the possibility that Burgess put the fake Leo Crow in the hotel room and, as he did with Anne Lively, hired another thug to kill him; John would be alerted to this murder by prevision via the precogs, arrive at the scene in time to prevent this from happening. However, seeing all the evidence of Crow kidnapping John's son would likely make him execute Crow at the spot. This would lead to an alternate prevision several days before, where John now sees himself inexplicably executing Crow. In both these hypotheses, there is an original chain of events that lead to Crow's death that has effectively been 'overwritten' by new timelines, making it seem like Crow's murder comes out of nowhere.",
            "It's pretty obvious that Dr Hineman is quite eccentric, probably because she's been living in isolation for years. The kiss that she gave John can be interpreted as a Judas kiss, refer to \"an act appearing to be an act of friendship, which is in fact harmful to the recipient\". The Kiss of Judas, also known as the Betrayal of Jesus signifies the act of betrayal - a recurring theme of the movie: the system betraying John, and John betraying the system."

            "The Caller admits to Stu that he had been following him for some time. Learning his habits, and his intimate details. So The Caller knew that Stu always stopped at that particular Phone Booth to call Pam at certain points in the week. So the caller planted a Sigma 380 in the overhead light inside the phone booth on one of Stu's regular days where he takes a trip to that booth. Next, The Caller makes his way to the apartment and sets up all his ammunition, and his rifle. Next, The Caller ordered the pizzas for Stu and likely told the delivery guy that if he didn't want them, to bring them to an alternate address (the address where the Caller was). Once Stu refused the pizzas, the delivery guy would bring the pizzas to The Caller and the Caller would likely take him captive until the events of the film unfold. Once The Caller found out the police were on their way to the apartment, he would slash the Pizza guy's throat and grab his secondary rifle (or perhaps his actual rifle and the one seen in the apartment was a decoy) and make his exit.If The Caller truly wanted to get away with it and frame the pizza guy, then the rifle in the apartment would have been the one used and The Caller would have had a back-up. Otherwise, the rifle in the apartment was a decoy and he took his actual rifle with him because he simply wanted to escape the scene. Either theory works and it's up to the viewer to decide how it may have played out. While The Caller revealed he was still alive to Stu, he only revealed himself after Stu had been given a dose of morphine and so Stu may have forgotten all about it or shrugged it off as a dream."

            "There is some debate on what we are supposed to believe happened at the end of the film. Is Teddy lying/truthful? Did Leonard's wife actually die and if she did how did she die? Was there a second attacker? Was there even an attack? Is Teddy the second attacker? Etc. In most regards it does not matter what we believe happened in the backstory. The \"twist\" is independent of all of that. Of the many questions raised throughout the story, most of them could be thought of as macguffins. The twist in the film is that at the end, no matter what the truth is, Leonard believes that Teddy is not the second attacker yet wants to kill him anyway. If Leonard believed that Teddy were the second attacker, he would kill him then and there. Even though he does not believe Teddy is the second attacker (whether he is or not) he still decides to set him up. Leonard even indicates in the voice-over before setting up Teddy that he does not even think the Teddy could be the second attacker: \"You think I just want another puzzle to solve? Another John G to look for? You're a John G. So you can be my John G. Do I lie to myself to be happy? In your case, Teddy, yes, I will.\" We can argue why or how his actions are moral/immoral, but his actions demonstrate he does not believe Teddy is the second attacker and is abandoning any quest for the second attacker. Whether this means that Leonard believes him to be dead, \"unfindable\" or in some other condition is not explicitly indicated. Writing down Teddy's license plate indicates that Leonard believes that the second attacker is already dead (or unknowable or no longer worth hunting) and is choosing to set himself up to kill Teddy, a man he does not believe to be the second attacker. So, Leonard admits to consciously choosing to lie to himself in order to continue on a \"false quest\" in order to make himself happy.",
            "There tend to be several schools of thought regarding the film's interpretation. One is that Teddy is lying at the end and that there is no full exposition in the film or even that the film encourages one to create their own explanation. Another school of thought is that Teddy provides the exposition for the film. Even though there is no confirmation of Teddy's story, there is also nothing refuting it and Teddy is the only source of information in the film for the events from the attack to the start of the film, so it is the most complete explanation which can come from the film. The events leading up to and through the movie are with this presumption (also included are added \"facts\" from the supplemental material for completeness). Unlike the movie, this explanation is presented in chronological order.Leonard is an insurance investigator. One of his early cases is Sammy Jankis. Leonard relates how Sammy was in a car accident and acquired \"anterograde memory dysfunction\" (AMD). Leonard studies up and learns about this condition, and investigates Sammy and his testing. Sammy is not married and he is eventually discovered to be faking his condition. It seems that the big \"giveaway\" to the audience is due to Sammy's incorrect assumptions on this condition. He did not pretend to learn through conditioning and kept getting shocked by the same electrified objects instead of learning to avoid them, as someone with AMD would do.Later Leonard and his wife were attacked. His wife was raped. Leonard killed one of the attackers, but he was hit in the head by the second attacker. His wife, however, did not die in the attack. After the attack, Leonard (ironically) got AMD, the same condition he studied about earlier. Leonard was not focused and was content to just pretty much do nothing. He had no goals to drive him to do anything. (There are many possibilities about what happened with this investigation, most likely the cops took an easy way out (as Leonard suggested) and never looked for a second attacker...) His wife tried working with him, but eventually got \"sick of this\" and decided to try to snap Leonard out of it or just wanted to die. She used her diabetes to either \"test Leonard\" or (more likely) have him assist in killing her with an insulin overdose. At this point, Teddy is brought in to investigate Leonard's wife's death. Leonard, on some level, \"remembers\" killing her and starts to become more \"focused\".Teddy and Leonard do some investigating on finding Leonard's new quest, the hunt for the second attacker. They eventually discover a partial name (John G), which coincidentally also matches Teddy's name. Leonard eventually is found \"not guilty\" of the death (most likely due to his condition) and is placed in a mental institute. During his stay, he learns to cope better with his condition, through notes and photos. He has a focus and a goal (finding and killing John G).Leonard escapes from the institute and somehow hooks back up with Teddy. Teddy and Leonard track down and kill the second attacker. Leonard gets his picture taken with his finger pointing to his chest. Leonard's quest is complete, Teddy is happy to have helped in the vengeance. But, the \"killing\" does not \"stick\". Leonard does not believe it as well as some other elements of the truth, and starts to \"delete items\" from the file. Teddy leads Leonard along, continuing the investigation for some time. Eventually Teddy reluctantly decides to try and make Leonard happy again, by finding some \"bad guy\", killing him, and also making some money. He decides on Jimmy Grantz. He feeds info to Leonard to indicate that the first name may also be \"James\" (not just \"John\") and begins the feeding to Leonard of the information.The movie takes place a little over a year since the killing of the second attacker, Leonard discovers the truth and decides to setup Teddy. Like the items in his file that do not match Leonard's belief of what happened, the evidence that he has already killed two \"John G\"s is destroyed, and Teddy is \"marked for deletion\" by Leonard with the \"fact\" of the license plate. Leonard finds a note from Natalie (meant for Jimmy to meet her \"after\") and thinks it is for him. He meets Natalie at Ferdy's bar. Natalie tries using Leonard to kill Dodd, Jimmy's partner, who she wants out of the picture because she says Dodd may come after her looking for the money. Leonard will not kill for Natalie but runs Dodd out of town. Natalie takes pity on Leonard and helps him in his quest by running the license plate for him. Leonard then meets Teddy after convincing himself that Teddy is John G, and kills him. Leonard probably killed the first John G right after escaping (which was \"over a year ago\" as Teddy said in the film).",
            "It can not be proved whether he is truthful or not, based on information in the film since there is no reliable narrator to confirm anything, and thus the opinion on this tends to be split. The biggest support for he his telling the truth tends to come from that it provides an answer to the mysteries in the film. The other fact is that Leonard seems to believe him, which he would have no reason to do if he believed Teddy was a liar. However, Teddy is definitely not always truthful and he is shown using Leonard's condition and manipulating him and even admits to lying.Nolan has provided several commentaries for the film, one where he claims Teddy is being truthful but also another where he claims Teddy is lying seemingly supporting both interpretations.Teddy's reminding Leonard of his real name (in spite of the danger connected) adds credibility to his words, as does the photograph. Most importantly, however, Leonard's actions show that he believes Teddy and indicates to us that Teddy is telling the truth, as in we do not know the truth of it, but Leonard does. If Leonard knew Teddy was lying, and that his true quest was not done, some argue he would not have changed the hunt to Teddy. Leonard is shown remembering giving his wife injections, he is shown lying and denying it. Leonard even admits to himself he will lie to himself. He sets up Teddy (knowing he is not the second attacker) and decides to make himself never believe Teddy by lying to himself and saying that Teddy is a liar.However, as Leonard himself said in the film, \"memories can be distorted; they're an interpretation, not a record.\" Long term memory degrades in time also, whether people have Leonard's condition or not. Leonard's memory of himself giving his wife an injection can be simply that-an imagination, a distortion of his memories, an indication that neither Teddy nor Leonard is reliable. In other words he stalls, confirming that Teddy's confusing (and untruthful) logic is working to at least to some effect, though why Leonard is so confused that he would imagine preparing syringes before Teddy mentions Leonard's wife being diabetic and also has them long after he has forgotten Teddy seems to raise some doubts about the \"imagination\" aspect of it, leaving the theories of how \"instinct\" works.",
            "One can accept the exposition provided in the film by Teddy. As Nolan indicated in one of the commentary track: \"A lot of people watch the film would rather believe Teddy and the appalling ideas that he presents than to go without an answer\". Since the film does not provide any proof of whether Teddy is lying or not, is also allows one to presume that Teddy is lying and that the film provides no answers. This allows viewers to create dozens of alternative theories and to make speculations that don't come from the film. Some of these involve only presuming that Teddy lying, some presume that Leonard is lying, and some presume that Leonard may be faking his condition. Some raise the question of whether Leonard could literally be Sammy Jankis or that Sammy is completely fictional, whether or not there was an attack, whether Leonard was married, etc. If there was an attack, speculation on Dodd's and Natalie's role in the attack and in the setup of Jimmy and Teddy has also been debated. Some alternative theories even involve manipulations by characters never shown within the film. There is even speculation that Teddy made up the story of Sammy Jankis and somehow has the ability to implant it into Leonard's mind. In addition to the dozens of alternate theories possible when Teddy is presumed to be lying, there are essentially an infinite number of possibilities if one presumes that the events in the film did not happen at all or may be just shadows and inaccurate recollections of one of the characters or even that the film is meant to be just an enormous dream sequence.",
            "While some may believe anything we see may be subject to interpretation and none is objective facts (only subjective) this analysis leads to an infinite number of solutions for an answer and allows any interpretation to be valid which does not seem to be a reasonable answer. It seems more likely that we should accept the events that we see occur during the film to be true. Most people seem to believe that the events we see occur in the movie are facts. For example, we see Leonard kill Teddy. This then becomes a fact. The reason he did it, what he believes at the time can all be conjectured, but they will never be facts. On the other hand, the \"Sammy Story\" or the recollection of the attack that Leonard tells to people, are not composed of facts. It would be a fact that Leonard stated these things, but the events we \"see\" Leonard tell us about, we did not see happen: Leonard may be lying or just mistaken. We can conjecture things that do not agree with what Leonard says, but those conjectures must be supportable by being able to explain why Leonard is lying or how he becomes mistaken. There must be a motivation for someone to lie (not simply that he is lying, since he is a liar) that is part of the theory.When the story is broken out (with no other conjectures) we can see the events we would then judge as facts: The chronology starts with the second scene in the film (the first Black & White scene). The BW scenes are in order and go thru the initial chronology. Leonard is in the hotel talking on the phone, explaining about Sammy and shaving his leg. The person on the phone (presumably Teddy, though we are never shown for sure who it is) is giving him some info about the case. Leonard tattoos fact 5 (\"drug dealer\") and eventually meets Teddy and goes to meet a man (Jimmy Grantz) who Leonard thinks killed his wife. Leonard meets and kills Jimmy and takes his picture. As his picture develops we move from BW to the color sequences. Note these sequences while shown forward, are ordered in reverse order and alternate with the BW sequences.Teddy comes (pretends he does not know Leonard, though Leonard is aware that they have met due to his note on Teddy's picture) and Leonard gets angry with him. Leonard is also upset that Jimmy seemed to know about Sammy which means he also must have met Jimmy before now. Teddy tells Leonard that Sammy was a faker with no wife and that Leonard's wife was diabetic. Leonard decides to set Teddy up as his next victim by writing down Teddy's license plate as \"fact 6\" and also indicating that he should not believe Teddy's lies. Leonard tosses Teddy's keys, steals Jimmy's car and leaves Teddy trying to find his keys. Leonard goes to Emma's and gets fact 6 tattooed on his leg. Teddy finds Leonard there. They argue, Leonard sneaks out the back, finds a note that Natalie gave to Jimmy in the clothes Leonard stole, and thinking it is meant for him, goes to meet Natalie at the bar. Natalie seems suspicious and a little afraid of this man in Jimmy's clothes and car and tries to figure out what is going on. Leonard tells her about his condition and she tests him with the \"spit drink\". Later they leave the bar and go to her house. At Natalie's, Leonard explains about the attack and Natalie eventually leaves Leonard alone in her home. When she returns she comes back acting upset, hides all the pens, and tries to convince Leonard to kill Dodd. She even tells Leonard that she is going to use him. She gets Leonard angry enough to punch her. She then leaves. She waits in her car for some time, presumably giving time for Leonard to forget, and then returns pretending that Dodd beat her up. She gives him info about Dodd and how Leonard can find him. Leonard leaves. Teddy is waiting in Leonard's car and tries to convince Leonard that Natalie is not to be trusted. Leonard writes this on her picture, but after Teddy leaves the \"don't believe his lies\" convinces him to cross it out. Teddy also told him to get a room at the discount inn, which he does. (and Burt gives him a new room) At the motel, he calls an escort and \"relives the attack\". He then leaves with the items from the motel and burns them during the rest of the evening.In the morning, Dodd finds Leonard and tries to kill him. Leonard escapes and using the note from Natalie, waits for Dodd in Dodd's motel room. Leonard showers and eventually beats up Dodd and ties him up in the closet. Not knowing what to do later he calls Teddy. Teddy and Leonard \"run Dodd out of town\". Later Leonard finds the picture of Dodd and Natalie's note and confronts her about Dodd. Leonard spends the night at Natalie's. The next morning Leonard and Natalie setup a meeting when they can meet and Natalie can provide info she will get from her friend at the DMV about \"John G\"s license plate. Leonard leaves, Teddy is waiting and they go to lunch. Leonard then goes back to the Discount Inn but has no key. Burt takes him into his old room and tells him about renting more than 1 room. Leonard sees the note about his meeting with Natalie. Leonard meets Natalie at the cafe, where she gives him the license plate info which is Teddy's driver's license info (exactly as Leonard intended when he wrote it down). Natalie gives Leonard an address/directions to an \"abandoned place outside of town\" where her boyfriend did \"bigger deals\". They both leave and Leonard goes back to the Discount Inn. Back in his room, Leonard looks over his facts, calls Teddy, notices that Teddy is the man on the license photo, realizes what the facts indicate had occurred, adds the note to Teddy's picture \"He is the one\" and then \"kill him\". Leonard meets Teddy in the lobby and they drive to the abandoned location where Leonard shoots Teddy.While this description details what happens in the film it really does not explain anything. It is like a mystery movie, we know the facts of what happened and who was killed, but we want to know the details of what happened. Why did the events occur as they did. Are people lying, when and why? There are all sorts of questions that are raised during the film. A listing of the facts is just not enough to satisfy us. We must analyze the film to try to understand it.",
            "Both from the point of view of movie consistency and judging by the information offered by the film, in spite of possibilities of various interpretations, most believe Leonard is not faking and really suffers from the anterograde amnesia. There are several things which really demonstrate that he is not faking: (1) Why would Leonard \"fake\" even when he is alone: who is he faking for (us, the viewers of the film)? (2) Why would Leonard put himself in danger by \"knowingly\" chasing after a man (Dodd) who has a gun and is trying to kill him? (3) Why would Leonard put himself in danger by showering in the room of a man (Dodd) who wants to kill him? (4) Why does Leonard need to \"lie to himself\" (since if he were faking, he would not be lying to himself; he would know that Teddy is not John G.) to set Teddy up for killing? If he decided that he wanted to kill Teddy, why not just kill him? Why would he need to \"fool himself\" by tattooing the license plate? (5) Another indication is while in the bathroom, Leonard tries to wash off his \"remember Sammy Jankis\" tattoo. If Leonard were faking he would know it was not written on, but tattooed, so he would have no reason to try to wash it off.Also, if Leonard were faking, when and why did he even start to fake it? Why would he start faking after the accident? If his wife died in the accident (as some believe) why pretend to fake the condition, as it would otherwise be so much easier to get vengeance. If his wife died \"testing the faking\" with the insulin (as others believe), then Leonard knowingly killed her - which then begs for a motive of why Leonard decided to kill his wife. There are some questions on things he seems to remember which can be explained by editing. It is clear we do not see Leonard 24 hours per day / 7 days a week. We only see him for a total of about 2 hours over the course of presumably about 3 days. There is a lot of information that we do not see.",
            "This question is never answered in the film, the supplemental material does not offer any clues, nor has Nolan ever answered it. There does seem to be hint (not a suggestion) that Leonard knows, at leas on some level, that he has already killed the 2nd attacker. If he does, it is most likely a distant recollection not a conscious memory. The hint comes from Leonard's action in setting up Teddy for what he believes is a false quest (i.e. not a quest for the 2nd attacker). To start a false quest, it seems that he must believe that the 2nd attacker is dead since we are offered no reason of why he would not abandon the real quest for the 2nd attacker. Thus it must be a very convincing belief. Therefore, Leonard must that know Teddy is not lying about Sammy being a faker, Sammy not having a wife, or that his wife was diabetic. Because if any of those things are lies, Leonard would have reason to doubt Teddy about the 2nd attacker and thus would not start a false quest. Also, Leonard must not be able to spot any indication of falsehood in Teddy saying that the 2nd attacker being dead.But even with all these things, Leonard would know that just because he could not spot Teddy lying, does not necessarily mean he was being truthful. So the question is would a man obsessed with vengeance, be convinced that the 2nd attacker is dead with just the word of Teddy? Given that Leonard didn't even completely believe Teddy when he was truthful about warning Leonard about Natalie makes it seem even less plausible. When told about Natalie, Leonard wrote the note in handwriting to show his future self the statement is in doubt and was written \"under duress\". But we see indication of any doubt or duress in Leonard's belief of Teddy. And if there is any doubt at all for Leonard, there is no reason to start a false quest. Thus we are led to believe that Leonard has no doubts that the 2nd attacker is dead. Thus in addition to knowing Teddy is truthful about the Sammy and insulin things and seeing no falsehood in statement that the 2nd attacker killed a year ago; Nolan also indicates that we should also conclude that, on some level, Leonard remembers that he killed the 2nd attacker (even if is it a distant memory, like a dream, or feeling of deja vu).Actually, all of this is explained in the film by two lines: \"How can I heal, when I can't feel time?\", and more-so toward the end of the film when Leonard asks himself, \"Do I lie to myself to be happy?\" Teddy even extrapolates it in the final dialogue. It's essentially trained memory except Leonard has trained himself to not believe... otherwise what purpose would his life serve?",
            "Some have argued that this is one of the biggest holes in the expositional theory of this film, though the \"hole\" stems from misunderstanding about AMD. Presuming Teddy is truthful denies one of what some see as the premise of the film: Leonard can not remember anything after the attack. This is the simple explanation of what anterograde memory dysfunction is-the inability to remember new things. One can argue with how accurately AMD has been portrayed in the movie (see below for some discussion on this), but Nolan clearly has given us the \"ground rules\" of his movie portrayal. For Teddy to be telling the truth, we must accept that Leonard is able to make new memories and that he can make them selectively: he only remembers what Nolan wants him (and needs him) to remember, just for the plot twist.Some ignore the \"hole\" and just presume it \"somehow happened,\" and just explain Leonard's need to repress the memory and somehow condition himself to remember it differently. This idea not only ignores the \"hole\", but is inconsistent with this real condition. Conditioning does not work to create memories of new facts; these are explicit memories. Conditioning creates new implicit memories. But the perception of the \"hole\" is created by ignoring the real facts of this real medical condition. The creation of new memories is possible by this condition (see below). Amnesias are never absolute: \"Amnesia is not an all-or-nothing condition, and even H.M., from time to time, has meagre conscious recollections of information encountered postoperatively.\" (See the article here.) Note: H.M. (after his death in 2008, the need for anonymity was gone and his name was revealed to be Henry Molaison) is a \"classic example\" of a man with AMD. There is much online about him; google for antergorade amnesia \"H.M.\" to get a number of hits and info. H.M.'s was a \"pure case\" caused by surgery and not an accident. He had epileptic seizures and the doctors believed that if they removed some of his temporal lobe (including the hippocampus), then he would no longer get them. The doctors were correct in this respect; they cured him of his seizures. He also got this condition since (it was later discovered) the hippocampus is important to the \"consolidation\" of memory (converting the short-term to long-term memory).Nolan also suggests (provides us a clue to) this fact when he shows us a shot which may be interpreted as a memory of Leonard in a mental institute: a memory he could not have if the condition were absolute (yes, there are alternate explanations for the scene, but alternate explanations do not negate this explanation). Nolan does suggest how it is possible and why this type of memory is retained. The flash of Sammy turning into Leonard in the mental institute suggests a \"projection\" of Leonard's implicit recollections onto explicit Sammy memories. The anchor of the recollection is the Sammy memory.It is important to realize that this condition does not force Leonard to start with a clean slate. His memories are not \"erased.\" The short-term memories are just typically not consolidated into long-term memories. However, Leonard does have experiences after the attack, and on some level bits are recalled, though maybe only subconsciously, and some relegated to show up only as \"conditioning\" (some probably to his surprise-when did I learn to do that?) other things only recalled as distant memories. These are the implicit, non-declarative memories. For example, in Oliver Sacks' book: The Man who Mistook his Wife for a Hat, he has an entire chapter on a man named \"Jimmy G.\" who got this condition (anterograde memory dysfunction) from chronic alcoholism (this is termed \"Korsakoff's syndrome\"). Sacks states: Jimmie sometimes retained faint memories, some dim echo or sense of familiarity. Thus five minutes after I had played tic-tac-toc (sic) with him, he recollected that \"some doctor\" had played this with him \"a while back\" - whether the \"while back\" was minutes or months ago he had no idea.Also, this condition does allow you to learn through conditioning (as mentioned many times in the movie), but some things may \"break through\" that typically won't. \"Jimmy G\" is also discussed online and it has been reported that: Jimmy was stuck in the year 1945, it turned out. He only remembered one or two events since that year.\" (One was the death of his brother, which says something about the relationship of emotions and encoding.)It appears that Nolan is suggesting that Leonard can recall his wife's death (to some extent). It seems that Leonard has a unique perspective. Before Leonard got this condition, he studied and learned about this condition-he observed a subject (Sammy) being tested. Then when he was tested for other items that are only vaguely recalled he was better able to \"project/transfer\" those implicit recollections onto his actual explicit (declarative) memories of Sammy. His memories of Sammy's life becomes a mixture of \"just Sammy\" items (Leonard's actual memories), items that (more or less) relate to both Sammy and Leonard, and items that are \"wholly Leonard\" that are projected onto Sammy. It even will contain some confabulations (common among people with memory problems) of items that have nothing to do with either one of them, it is just Leonard filling gaps in the story. It is a way of his mind finding an alternate method of storing these memories. Leonard is unable (due to physical damage) to put them directly into long-term memories, so the mind finds an alternate path through other sections of this brain and \"projects\" them onto Sammy-memories. These recollections are essentially misremembered. It is unconscious, not conscious: Leonard believes these things are true. When confronted with facts which dispute it he can realize the problem, but it can be confusing.This type of mechanism can be supported by the facts of this condition: Declarative memory can be created by non-declarative means \"Thus, factual information, which is ordinarily learned as declarative (conscious) knowledge and with the participation of the medial temporal lobe, can be acquired as non-declarative memory\" which is a means of saying that explicit memories can be learned from implicit memories as has been hypothesized as a mechanism for what Nolan seems to be suggesting. As stated, this is enhanced by Leonard's knowledge of Sammy and his explicit memories of Sammy. It has been pointed out in the classic AMD case of H.M. that \"experiments demonstrate that H.M. is capable of learning some new factual information when it can be fixed to already acquired knowledge.\" This paper even the suggests that this can lead to false memories due to incorrect anchoring. H.M. seems to have anchored some of the Challenger explosion (which happened after his AMD) with his memories of the Titanic disaster.",
            "This seems to be a misconception among many people and the question is flawed. The movie actually shows that Leonard does have memories of her being diabetic, so the real questions should be: \"If Leonard's wife was diabetic why does Leonard deny it?\" and \"If Leonard's wife was not diabetic why does Leonard have memories of her being diabetic?\" The first point is that on 3 occasions we see Leonard with memories of him preparing an insulin injection or giving her one. There are two distinct memories. In movie sequence, they are:(1) At 1:21:25, Leonard is alone watching the TV at Natalie's and has a memory flash of someone's hand tapping a syringe twice. It is a quick shot and we do not see who it is. It acts in the film as clue, a foreshadowing of a future truth. It is a supraliminal clue common with foreshadowing. We can see it, but tend not to notice it unless we are looking for it. When we see it, even if we would pause and review it, we still would be hard-pressed to know it is Leonard's hand. We learn it is Leonard' hand, later in the film when we are shown the more complete sequence. (This sequence, though earlier in the film, would occur long after Leonard would have forgotten what Teddy said about his wife, so it is clear indication that it does not come from just a \"consideration\" of what Teddy told him).(2) At 1:42:50, Teddy says, \"The insulin...\" At this point in the film (or in time), we (viewers or Leonard) have not heard any mention about Leonard's wife being diabetic, we have only heard the Sammy Story about the \"the insulin\". Yet after Teddy says, \"The insulin...\" Leonard has that same memory we saw earlier in the film of someone tapping a syringe twice, only this time we are shown that it is indeed Leonard who is tapping the syringe to move the air bubbles to the top. Leonard denies the memory we clearly see him have, claiming: \"That's Sammy, not me\". We are not shown any \"alternate version\" of this memory like we will later with the other memory.(3) At, 1:43:23 Teddy states, \"It was your wife who had diabetes\". We now see a different insulin memory than previously. It is a memory of Leonard injecting his wife's leg with insulin. Again we hear Leonard deny it: \"My wife wasn't diabetic\". Only this time when Teddy presses, \"You sure?\", we see Leonard think, and his denial is not just a lie to Teddy, but the \"visualization\" is essentially a lie to himself also, ignoring the memory and choosing to believe it was just a pinch and then claiming again: \"She wasn't diabetic\".If Leonard's wife were not diabetic, there is no reason that he has memories (or even just thoughts) of her being diabetic at three separate times in the film: especially when two come about with no prompting about her being diabetic. The first one seems to be most likely due to the pervasive nature of his diabetic memories. It was such a part of his life with his wife, that he is bound to, while thinking of her, have some of these memories \"pop up\". If his wife were not diabetic, it seems odd for him to think about preparing an insulin injection. The second comes with just a prompting of the term \"insulin\". Again, it seems odd for Leonard to have this memory if his wife were not diabetic. The one that comes with the direct statement of her being diabetic (#3) is the one he most actively denies and the one Nolan even suggests through the \"pinching visualization\" that he is trying to actively deny and ignore it. It suggests the lying to himself, which we will be shown explicitly later that he does do. So since we know he does have memories of insulin injections with his wife, we can return to what should be the real questions:If Leonard's wife was diabetic why does Leonard deny it? This one seems pretty clear from the film. Leonard does not want to realize that he killed his own wife. He seems to have misremembered the insulin OD as a Sammy memory and does not want to acknowledge the truth. The other question-\"If Leonard's wife was not diabetic why does Leonard have memories of her being diabetic?\"-is something that does not seem to have an answer in the film or even through speculation. This lack of a reason makes it seem clear to many that Nolan's intent was to make us believe that Leonard's wife was diabetic. There is no reason why Leonard would have memories of a diabetic wife if she were not diabetic.The question has also been raised at why we see only a small number of memories of a diabetic wife. We see only two memories on three occasions. If Leonard's wife were diabetic he would have years of memories, hundreds if not thousands of them. There is nothing to negate the possibility that Leonard has plenty of memories of his wife being diabetic. Just because we do not see every possible memory that Leonard may have of his life before the attack, does not mean he does not have the memories. The movie is edited. We do not see Leonard 24/7 and even then we do not see everything Leonard thinks about, nor do we hear constant voiceovers to explain things. Nolan indicates things and negates other things by the film. The film is a mystery, a puzzle, you must look at multiple clues to get an answer.We are not even seeing random snippets of Leonard's life and memories. Nolan is choosing what he presents to us. He has chosen to not show us the other memories since his goal is to surprise us. He chooses to show us memories Leonard has of his wife that do not involve diabetes and he chooses to only show us three select times when Leonard does have the memory. One is a very small segment, intended to act as foreshadowing the other, the second a more complete memory of the small segment so we understand the significance and the third a separate memory. This technique serves a dual purpose: it keeps the surprise, but also demonstrates that Leonard does indeed remember his wife being diabetic which fills any hole suggesting he does not remember something so pervasive. Nolan indicates that Leonard does remember a diabetic wife. But it should also be clear that no matter how pervasive diabetes is, Leonard will still have memories of his wife that do not involve diabetes. Nolan chooses to show us more of these memories.It has been suggested that the film implies that Leonard may also have retrograde amnesia. If we believe Teddy's version as the truth, then it could be interpreted that Leonard has forgotten that Sammy Jankis did not have a wife. But while it is actually common for people with anterograde amnesia to get some retrograde amnesia, it tends to block out a series of time of days to years. It would not manifest itself in being able to remember Sammy and not remember he did not have a wife. A more likely explanation is that he does \"remember\" Sammy having a wife due to the false memories that have been anchored to Sammy memories.",
            "If one does not believe Teddy or is arguing about the reliability of Leonard's memory, the detectives who concluded that there was only one attacker may be correct and we can believe Leonard killed him. If one chooses to believe Leonard's account to Natalie, there were at least two attackers. Leonard shot one attacker in the head, and the other got away. If we presume that Teddy is telling the truth during the exposition, they were a \"couple of junkies too strung out to realize your wife didn't live alone\", and that Teddy was assigned to the case of his wife's death, and believed Leonard about there being a second attacker. He decided to help him find the second attacker (who they discover is a white male with first name of John and last name starting with a \"G\". Over a year before the events of the film, they find \"John G\" and Leonard kills him. Afterwards Leonard decides to continue hunting for a man he already killed, which leads us a year later to Leonard in the Discount Inn. If we presume that Teddy is lying, the film provides no suggestion or hint of who they might be or even if there was an attack at all.",
            "This is a difficult question to answer, since we are not even sure of all the facts. She could have died in the attack, though it is also possible there was not an attack or that Leonard does not even have a wife. It is all a matter of what one takes as fact and what one concludes from that fact. There is also the exposition which indicates (and can be supported via the character's actions at the end) that Leonard's wife died from an insulin overdose. She survived the attack/rape and went on living her life, however, she could not deal with her husband's (Leonard's) condition. She wanted to kill herself and she used Leonard as a proxy. She set Leonard up to give her multiple shots, and died from the overdose. Even though it was a \"suicide by proxy\", both Teddy and Leonard believe that death was a result of the attack and thus the second attacker is still culpable for her death.",
            "There have been several debates about Sammy Jankis. The first of the tattoos shown in the movie is \"remember Sammy Jankis\". The tattoo seems to help Leonard focus on that time of his life and is part of Leonard's investigation \"system\". It is clear that, if we choose to believe Teddy at the end, Sammy was a real person since Teddy explicitly indicates that Sammy was a \"con-man\", \"a faker\", he did not say that \"Sammy did not exist\". In this scenario, Sammy is real and Leonard investigated him, but what Leonard says about Sammy is most likely a combination of real Sammy memories, items that combine elements of both Sammy and Leonard, elements of just Leonard items, and some confabulation. If we presume that Teddy is lying and not providing an exposition, it is not entirely clear. Most choose to think Teddy is lying and Leonard is telling the truth, suggesting that what Leonard says about Sammy is completely about Sammy.For Sammy to not to have existed at all, actually not only requires us to not believe Teddy, but also requires that Leonard is faking. Someone with this condition could not \"create Sammy\" after getting this condition. The film seems to indicate that Leonard is not \"faking\". Even if the whole story of Sammy was a confabulation by Leonard, there is no way he could keep using the same name. Even the \"remember Sammy Jankis\" would be a constant confusing element for Leonard. He would continually wonder things like: \"Who is Sammy Jankis? I don't know a Sammy Jankis, Why am I supposed to remember him?\" If Sammy does not exist, it also means that Leonard had no reason to learn about this condition before the attack from investigating Sammy. So it raises the questions of how did he learn about it after the attack or why did he forget the reason he learned about it before the attack?There is a sequence in the film where Sammy changes to Leonard in the mental hospital scene. It can be described as:\n(1) 01:29:22 (B&W Scenes) We see the \"test\" with Sammy and his wife hear Leonard's voiceover: \"She went into a coma and never recovered. Sammy couldn't understand or explain what happened.\"\n(2) 01:29:30 We see Leonard on the phone and saying: \"He's been in a home ever since.\"\n(3) 01:29:32 We see Sammy in a Home and hear voiceover: \"He doesn't even know that his wife's dead.\"\n(4) 01:29:36 Leonard on phone: \"I was wrong about Sammy, and I was wrong about his wife. She wasn't interested in the money. She just needed to understand his problem.\"\n(5) 01:29:43 Sammy in Home, Leonard voiceover: \"His brain didn't respond to conditioning. But he wasn't a con man.\"\n(6) 01:29:47 Sammy in Home, Leonard voiceover: \"And when she looked into his eyes, she thought he could be the same person.\"\n(7) 01:29:50 Sammy in Home, person walking behind Sammy, Leonard voiceover: \"When I looked into his eyes, I thought I saw recognition.\"\n(8) 01:29:53 Leonard on phone: \"Now I know. You fake it. If you're supposed to recognize somebody, you just pretend to.\"\n(9) 01:29:58 Sammy in Home, person in front, Leonard in Home, Leonard voiceover: \"You bluff it to get a pat on the head from the doctors.\"\n(10) 01:30:01 Leonard on phone: \"You bluff it to seem less of a freak.\"\n(11) 01:30:07 Leonard on phone: \"What drug dealer?\"\n(12) 01:30:09 (Color Scene) Jaguar tires screeching in front of Emma'sThis sequence seems to be either a suggestion that Leonard has projected some of his recollections onto Sammy (Teddy is truthful) or just a scene indicating how Leonard \"associates\" himself with Sammy's condition (Teddy is lying). There seems to be nothing to indicate a suggestion that they are the same person since if Teddy is lying we don't believe the Leonard's wife being diabetic and if Teddy is truthful, then Sammy is a faker with no wife and Leonard has a diabetic wife. For Sammy to be a faker, Teddy must be lying and also that Leonard's story can not be believed. This scene seems most likely to reflect a visual clue by Nolan as how Leonard may even \"project\" and \"misremember\" implicit recollections as explicit Sammy memories. The movie seems to suggest that the \"Sammy story\" that Leonard tells is a mixture of real Sammy memories from Leonard, recollections of Leonard about things that happened to him as well as Sammy, projections of things that happened to Leonard but did not happen to Sammy and even some confabulation (common among people with memory problems) of things that Leonard makes up to fill in the gaps.",
            "There is a scene in the final part that Leonard is lying alongside his wife, with a tattoo of \"I've Done It\" on the chest. Based on the entire film, the scene does not appear to be a \"flashback\" at all since the scene shows a tattoo \"I've Done It\" which he does not have at all in the film and in addition there is no sign that the tattoo was removed (and we do see a closeup of his chest). Since it is not a flashback, and it appears to be something in his mind that he is thinking about, it appears to be a fantasy/daydream/wish. It seems most likely that Leonard is driving and is looking for a tattoo parlor to tattoo fact 6, which he at this point believes is the license plate of the second attacker. He believes that he is close to finishing his quest, and he daydreams an (ironic) fantasy: his quest fulfilled and his wife still alive. It is probably meant to be ironic, since without her death there would have been no quest. It is even hinted by the film that she could have been still alive if he had shown the drive that he shows with the quest while she was alive. It is possible that the image is a clairvoyant vision of the future, but we see no indication that Leonard has any prescient visions elsewhere in the film, so this does not seem reasonable.It has been suggested that the scene could be not a vision in Leonard's mind at all but just a \"future scene\" (a flash-forward). This does not seem likely unless Nolan or Dody Dorn made a huge mistake. If it were a future scene, then the scene should come before we see Teddy shot and there should be a black and white scene after it that takes place before the second scene in the film. There should also be an \"overlapping\" segment at the beginning of it that matches the end of the Teddy being shot sequence (and in all likelihood, the Teddy being shot should not be in reverse, but that would just be another error made). Supporting that it is meant to come from Leonard's mind and is not a shot mistakenly put here, is the foreshadowing of the shot several times earlier in the sequence, when we get short glimpses of the scene. In support of the \"daydream\" interpretation is that, when the movie is watched in \"Chrono-order\" on the DVD, this scene still is shown in this location, it is not placed after Teddy is shot at the end of the chronological events version.",
            "Leonard got the scratches while fighting Jimmy Grantz. As he is strangling Jimmy, Jimmy scratches Leonard's face. There is a \"turn\" of Leonard's head as the scratching occurs. The sequence of events within the film are:\n(1) at 1:38:55, we see Leonard's face unscratched as he looks at Jimmy,\n(2) at 1:38:57, we see Jimmy scratch the left side of Leonard's face with his right hand as Leonard turns his head to the left,\n(3) at 1:38:58, we see a \"flashback\" of Leonard's wife's head in the shower curtain, and\n(4) at 1:39:00, we see Leonard's face with scratches as he again looks at Jimmy.",
            "(There are 26 tattoos, counting \"The facts\" as one tattoo; 27, if you count the \"daydream tattoo\").\nIn film order they are:\n(1) Left Hand (0:06:50) \"remember Sammy Jankis\" {Tattoo is in script}\n(2) Left Forearm (0:11:30) \"THE FACTS\"Between 0:14:00 - 0:14:30 we are shown the majority of the other tattoos as Leonard examines his body.\n(3) Circling his neck in mirror image: \"JOHN G.

            "\"John G\" is part of the name of one of the men that attacked Leonard and his wife. According to Teddy, they were a \"Couple of junkies too strung out to realize your (Leonard's) wife didn't live alone.\" The name \"John G\" came about before the events in the movie. Nothing is explicitly given in the movie to indicate how he got the name. There is also nothing in the info on website or supplemental DVD material which could be lead to that name (it does indicate he had it while he was in the mental institution). Most probably, it came about by the police files or his own and Teddy's investigation on the attack (If we believe that the supplemental material on the website online and on some of the DVDs is \"canon\" then it appears he was convinced of the name before he escaped the mental institute. A doctor's report indicates: \"Leonard seems convinced that the police have overlooked a second man involved in incident in his house in which he was injured. Leonard identifies the man as John G.\").It is possible though not too probable that it was \"created\" by Leonard (or even Teddy, though it would be a little stupid for Teddy to give his own name as that of the rapist and eventually murderer they are looking for). This makes Teddy out to be a complete idiot. It is also possible that, at some point in the past, Leonard already got mad enough at Teddy to write down a part of his (real) name to later persuade himself that it was the name of the killer, just like he did with the license plate number in the film. This seem unlikely since again it makes Teddy out to be an idiot, since he would seem unaware to the fact that while he was feeding Leonard info, Leonard was coming up with his own clues which were pointing to Teddy.",
            "Natalie's attitude to Leonard changes throughout the story:\n1. She sees him wearing her boyfriend's clothes driving her boyfriend's car so she suspects him to have killed Jimmy.\n2. After the \"test\" in the bar she believes that Leonard is not responsible since he cannot remember anything anyway and decides to use Leonard and his condition to get rid of Dodd (who is after the money that is now actually safely in Leonard's possession) so she tries to (unsuccessfully) manipulate Leonard into killing Dodd.\n3. Eventually she takes pity on Leonard and wants to help him find the person responsible for his condition - by providing information on the license plate number he had tattooed on his leg.",
            "In some cases it is clear that Leonard is talking to the front desk (and at least one time it is Burt since Leonard says \"Burt\" as if the man on the phone indicated his name). The other times it is most likely Teddy; early in the film Leonard tells Burt to hold all his calls except Teddy's as an exception. Thus it appears to be Teddy who is telling Leonard that Jimmy Grantz is the second attacker on the phone. Teddy does admit to doing this at the end of the film as well, supporting the conjecture that Teddy is on the phone.",
            "Leonard may not have an earlier picture of Teddy, for a variety of reasons. It is not explicitly given, but here are some thoughts: (1) Teddy may be lying at the end of the film and they may have just first met in the lobby of the Discount Inn. Leonard would have no picture of Teddy since they never met. (2) Leonard may have destroyed it for some reason (we see Leonard destroy evidence near the end of the film). The reason(s) would be subject to anyone's speculation, since nothing is explicitly given in the film about it. (3) Teddy may have stolen it for some reason to make it seem like they just met. Again, the reason(s) would be subject to anyone's speculation, since nothing is explicitly given in the film about it. (4) Leonard may have lost it. The movie shows how easy it is for Leonard to lose and forget things: he almost forgot the driver's license information at the cafe. (5) Leonard could have already had a picture of someone labeled \"Teddy\" but since he was meeting someone named \"Officer Gammell\" he did not realize that the man he was meeting was \"Teddy\". When he looked through his \"archived photos\", he found none labeled \"Gammell\" (though could have seen one or more of \"Teddy\") and by the time he met \"Gammell\" in the lobby, he no longer remembered the photo and when he took the picture, he no longer remembered that he had seen one of \"Teddy\".",
            "This is a very difficult question to answer since we aren't explicitly told how long they have even know each other. The key point from the film is that through the majority of the film time (both event time and screen time) Leonard was manipulating himself. If we believe Teddy's exposition at the end of the film, they have know each other for over a year and Teddy manipulated Leonard to kill Jimmy recently, though did allow Leonard to continue to believe that the second attacker was still alive. If we do not believe Teddy's exposition, they may have first met in the lobby of the Discount Inn or have known each other for decades.",
            "It is never explicitly stated in the film, but it is clear that they had met before: Jimmy appears to recognize Leonard when they first meet at the drug deal and associates him with Teddy (Jimmy sees Leonard and asks what Leonard is doing there and where Teddy is). Natalie indicates that her boyfriend (who is Jimmy) told her about a memory man. It is not unreasonable to presume that at some point, Teddy introduced Jimmy to Leonard. This would make sense for Teddy to do in his setup of Jimmy. Teddy was going to send Leonard to a drug deal so that Leonard would kill Jimmy. By introducing Jimmy to Leonard, Jimmy learns about Leonard's condition and believes him to be non-threatening. If Teddy had not introduced them, Jimmy would not know Leonard and is more likely to leave or attack Leonard for being at the scene of the crime. Teddy says that Jimmy dealt drugs out of the Discount Inn and that the guy at the front desk (Bert?) called him if anybody came snooping around. The guy called Jimmy when he saw Leonard taking a picture of \"the dump\". If this is to be believed then Jimmy would not have known Leonard, but known of him and would most likely have seen him at the Inn.",
            "The movie is not explicit as to why, but it appears to be an attempt to try and convince Leonard that they have met before and that he is not who Leonard thinks he is. Whether this was its intent or not, it seems to work this way on Leonard as it does seem to convince Leonard that Jimmy was not the second attacker. It is too late to save Jimmy because he is dead by the time Leonard pieces this together. Some have speculated that Jimmy is already dead at this time and Leonard only hears it in his imagination. While it is possible that anything we see in the film may be in Leonard's imagination, there is nothing to suggest that only he heard it as the audience hears it (it is even on the subtitles and in the script as well) and the film also seems to show a shot of him breathing a few seconds before the shot of him whispering, \"Sammy...\"",
            "The most likely reason suggested by the film is that Leonard removed the pages that would indicate things he does not want to believe, like things that (1) would remind him that it was he to have killed his wife, and (2) would be too specific about who John G is. This is supported by the fact that we are explicitly shown that Leonard destroys evidence (presumably of things he does not want to believe). We also see that Leonard is shown to choose to continue his quest (after he believes it is completed) and it is suggested that the quest is the only thing that gives sense and purpose to his existence. It is also possible that the someone else removed the pages for unknown reasons or that he got them incomplete though other than Leonard's speculation about this (with no data) there is no other suggestion of this in the film.",
            "The reason is never explicitly given. The most Leonard says on the subject is: \"I'd rather be mistaken for a dead guy than a killer.\" Speculations include (you can make up your own motives as well)... (1)The clothes and car are so much nicer than his. If you are willing to kill someone: stealing is not really a \"crime\". Why not take the nicer objects? (2) It could be part of his \"routine\": Kill a man, take his clothes and car. The clothes he had on and the truck may be from the man he killed a year ago. (3) It could be that he wants to make the killer of his wife suffer even more, and takes his clothes as a way of humiliating him. Leonard takes the man's life-his clothes and car, which are wrapped up in his identity-just as the man took his. This idea seems to work with a theme in Memento about \"Identity\" (especially mistaken identity). Natalie thinks Leonard is Jimmy, then thinks he is Teddy, then learns he is Leonard. Teddy is \"mistaken\" for the 2nd killer, Jimmy is \"mistaken\" for the 2nd killer. Sammy's story as a part of Leonard's story, etc. (4) It could \"simply\" be explained as a \"plot device\": Leonard has to do it, otherwise he won't find the note in \"his pocket\" and meet Natalie. (5) Leonard doesn't want to admit he's a murderer. He's lying to himself. If he's the victim, then he cannot be the murderer.",
            "Leonard kills Teddy since at the time he truly believes that Teddy is the second attacker since he manipulated himself to believe this. But the film indicates that Leonard does not believe Teddy is the second attacker since Leonard admits to lying to himself about it to be happy. But whether this happiness is to have a purpose and goal in life as Teddy suggests in the exposition, or that Leonard is just happy to kill anyone, or some other speculation not raised by the film is open to interpretation. There has been some speculation that Leonard sets up Teddy to avenge Jimmy's death or out of anger for being manipulated, but others have pointed out that Leonard would not need to lie to himself to do this but could have just killed Teddy in moral outrage if that was his intent with no need to lie to himself at all. Another theory is that Leonard does not want to be reminded that he killed his wife and wants to eliminate Teddy to prevent this from happening again. Leonard says he is \"not a killer\", meaning that he does not have the kind of personality to cold-bloodedly pull the trigger and kill Teddy while knowing he is doing it for reasons other than to avenge his wife's death. He does however have the ability to set something in motion that will impel him to kill Teddy later, so he writes down the license plate number as a way to do that.",
            "Since the last event in the film's chronology is the death of Teddy, the film does not explicitly answer this question. There are several possibilities if one chooses to speculate. If Leonard does not get caught by the police he may: (1) choose to continue to hunt for the dead Teddy (choosing to ignore any evidence that Teddy is already dead, (2) choose to stop hunting believing that Teddy is the second attacker, (3) delete or edit his current clues and begin to hunt other victims. If he does get caught by the police, he may: (1) be put into a more secure mental facility, (2) go to prison, (3) go to a facility for the criminally insane.",
            "Like most questions in this film, an explicit answer is never provided. At the end he briefly shows a badge to Leonard but Leonard doesn't seem to get enough of a look at it to confirm its authenticity. The movie mostly implies that he is, with only a few minor suggestions that he might not be. Teddy being the police officer that was assigned to Leonard's case would provide a reason as to why Teddy is in Leonard's life at all since it is obvious that he didn't know Teddy before the attack or he would remember him every time he saw him and wouldn't need a picture of him. Teddy seems to know a lot about Leonard's police file which would support that he really was the cop assigned to Leonard's case. He also seems to know a lot about Jimmy Grantz and his dealings, something that would probably be considered easy information for a local police officer to obtain. However, at the end when Leonard meets Teddy in the lobby after the phone call, Teddy greets Leonard with the traditional \"Lenny!\" and when Leonard says, \"Officer Gammel,\" Teddy suspiciously looks over at Burt, who wasn't paying attention, before confirming his identity and continuing outside. Also, when the two of them are in Dodd's hotel room and Leonard proposes that they force Dodd to leave town using a gun, Teddy replies, \"Why would I have a gun?\", when it is common for police officers to carry an off-duty weapon within their jurisdiction. Teddy's criminal motives (helping Leonard kill two people, taking drug money) may also support the idea that Teddy is not a cop, although it wouldn't be impossible to imagine a corrupt police officer doing the same thing. Teddy is revealed to have been lying about some things in this film along with several explanations given to Leonard about his motives that seem fishy, so it wouldn't be completely unreasonable to think that Teddy might not actually be a cop."

Bolton's response is one of silent fury.Presumably, without having read the actual novel or the script that this movie used, Bolton was under heavy pressure from the Mayor's office to carry out the raid, potentially under threat of losing his job. It's also likely that he was spiteful of Clarice and felt he wasn't going to take orders from her. Thinking he knew better.",
            "Ten years after the events in The Silence of the Lambs (1991), FBI Special Agent Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore) is assigned to the case of Mason Verger (Gary Oldman), the only surviving, but severely disfigured, victim of cannibalistic serial killer Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), and Verger wants revenge. Lecter, who disappeared (after the events in The Silence of the Lambs), is currently living in Florence, Italy as a library curator under the assumed name of Dr. Fell. Recently disgraced for a bungled drug raid in which five people were killed, Starling is contacted by the always opportunistic Lecter. Now that Lecter's whereabouts are known, a new transatlantic hunt for Lecter begins.",
            "The Silence of the Lambs is Chilton's last appearance in the franchise, in both the novels and the films. It is never out right stated whether Hannibal did kill and cannibalize Chilton during the time between The Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal. In the novel, it is mentioned that Chilton disappeared while on vacation seven years before the events of Hannibal; in the film Barney says that Lecter, when possible, preferred to eat \"the rude\" and that Chilton \"was a bad man\". Both statements strongly imply that Lecter did indeed kill and eat Chilton.",
            "Stripped of her gun and her FBI status, Clarice goes alone to the Verger estate to look for Lecter. She finds him strapped down and about to be fed to Verger's vicious boars. She shoots the two henchmen guarding him, one fatally, the other just wounding him. Just as Clarice sets Lecter free, the boars break out through the gate and Verger arrives to watch the carnage. One of Verger's henchmen shoots Clarice, so Lecter takes her into his arms as the boars go after the two downed henchmen. Verger orders his personal physician, Dr Cordell, to go into the swarming mass of squealing, ravenous boars to retrieve a gun, but Lecter convinces Cordell (who greatly dislikes Verger) to feed Verger to the boars and blame it on Lecter. Lecter takes the barely conscious Clarice to Krendler's lakehouse, where he removes the bullet and tends to her wound. When Clarice awakens from a morphine-induced sleep, she laboriously makes her way to a telephone to call for backup and then downstairs where she finds Lecter preparing an elegant dinner for Krendler, who appears to be heavily drugged. Clarice is horrified when she sees Lecter lift off the top of Krendler's skull, scoop out a portion of his brain, saut\u00e9 it, and feed it to Krendler. When Krendler insults Clarice, Lecter wheels Krendler to the kitchen and prepares to make his getaway, leaving Krendler to die and knowing that Clarice has called the FBI. Clarice tries to hit him with a candlestick, but Lecter catches her hair in the refrigerator door. He kisses her and is about to walk away when she slaps a cuff on his wrist and cuffs him to herself. When she refuses to give him the key, Lecter picks up a meat cleaver. \"This is really going to hurt,\" he says, and the cleaver comes down. In the next scene, Clarice is standing over the lake, watching for any signs of Lecter, who has disappeared. Her backup arrives, and Clarice identifies herself but says nothing about Hannibal Lecter getting away. In the final scene, Lecter is seated on an airplane, one of his own hands missing, about to enjoy his carry-on lunch. A small boy looks curiously into the box and asks what some of the food is. One of the containers holds what looks like saut\u00e9ed brain. Lecter offers the boy a bite.",
            "It's never made certain. Hannibal, when he says, \"above or below the wrist?\", suggests that he did but he could have been threatening to cut off Clarice's hand in order to scare her into giving him the key. It's also possible Hannibal chopped off only his thumb to wriggle out of the cuff. What is certain is that he definitely did not try to cut through the chain on the cuffs; it would have been too unbelievable and he clearly doesn't have the use of that hand in the final scene."

            "The Architect explains that the first version of the Matrix was designed to be a paradise free from suffering. However it was a \"monumental failure\" because humans felt it was some kind of dream and kept fighting the environment trying to free themselves, eventually leading to war and many deaths. He then designed its second version based on humans' worst persons (an image of Hitler is depicted, maybe to lead wars and keep those under control) and fantasies (powerful monsters were developed to hunt humans and kill those who'd reject the world). But it also failed, as most humans also rejected it and it became a mess. He then explains that the Oracle found out that humans were feeling they were being controlled and didn't accept that, so he designed the third version in a way that humans would feel, even if only subconsciously, that they had a choice. That led to over 99% choosing to stay, but inevitably there were those that would indeed choose to reject it, and they were still a threat if not put under control. He then allowed humans that'd choose to leave to actually leave the Matrix, and create Zion, a city where they could live, feeling they had chosen to be there. These humans were also allowed to enter Matrix back to look for other humans willing to leave and free them, so that they don't stay threatening the Matrix. Indeed, these people's actions are very destructive in the short periods they are inside it, frequently doing what we could call terrorism. Very distinct from when they are in Zion where they bound together to build and protect it. This issue also creates an anomaly: eventually a human would develop the ability of controlling Matrix's rules. Knowing that Zion's overgrowth is still a threat to the Matrix and that this anomaly would happen, the Architect created a method of controlling these humans so that the Oracle would earn their trust and direct the anomaly into the source, where he'd have to choose between saving Zion and causing Matrix to crash and kill all humans, or saving Matrix and humans in it and let Zion's population to die and then restart the loop choosing a few humans to rebuild Zion. He'd also prophetize his returning (as the anomaly is systemic and predicted to continue happening) and not tell them the truth, thereby betraying them, but making this system stable, so that humans and machines can both survive in some sort of harmony. It's not clear if Zion's world is the real world or a second virtual world, which would mean that all its inhabitants are still trapped in a dream. And there is a possibility that The One himself isn't a human that develops the ability to control Matrix's rules and needs to be controlled and persuaded, but another program the Architect created to fool the humans that choose to reject the Matrix and is enabled when Zion grows to a certain level. It's also implied that the Oracle isn't predicting the future, but instead is the equivalent of a real world's charlatan, who fools naive humans by using psychology methods. She tells them something is gonna happen in their lives, if it heppens then she was right, if it doesn't then they keep looking/waiting for it to.",
            "After explaining to Neo his purpose in the Matrix, the Architect presents him with two doors: the door on the right leads to the Source, while the door on the left leads to Trinity, who is falling just as in Neo's dream. Flying as quickly as possible, Neo catches her just seconds before she hits the ground and carries her to the top of a building where he reaches through the code of the Matrix and extracts the bullet, but it is too late. Trinity's heart stops beating, and she dies both in the Matrix and on the Nebuchadnezzar. Refusing to accept her death, Neo reaches through the code against and squeezes her heart, causing it to start beating again. Later, back on the Nebuchadnezzar, Morpheus can't believe that the Oracle's prophecy has not come true. Neo explains that the prophecy was a lie, another part of the Matrix meant to control them. Suddenly, the proximity alarm goes off, alerting the crew that Sentinels are near. They flee the ship just in time to watch it blown apart. As the Sentinels come after them, Neo suddenly stops running and exclaims, \"Something's different...I can feel them.\" He raises his hand and, like an EMP, stops them in mid-air, sending the Sentinels crashing to the ground. However, the strain is too much on Neo, and he also collapses, just as the Hammer arrives to rescue them. While Neo lies unconscious in sickbay, Trinity at his side, the Hammer crew tells Morpheus and Link about the counterattack Commander Lock (Harry Lennix) had planned but explains that someone screwed up and fired an EMP before they were in position, turning it into a slaughter.

            "No one has answered this question yet.",
            "Having \"infected\" the Oracle (Mary Alice), Smith gained her powers. Using her prophetic ability, he foresaw the end of the fight and which version of himself was there. If that is the version he believes will defeat Neo, then it is the only version that need fight at all. There is another school of thought that Smith, as Neo's opposite number in the equation balancing itself out, could not fight Neo to anything but a stalemate, regardless of how many Smiths joined the fight. We see this demonstrated to a lesser degree during their brawl in Reloaded. It wasn't until Neo chose to flee or surrender that their fights ended. Because Smith couldn't see past any decision and couldn't understand (Neo's decision to surrender), he did not foresee his ultimate destruction once he defeated Neo. A more simple explanation or addition to the aforementioned explanations is that Neo has become too powerful even for all those Smith duplicates in the Matrix. To show this concept, Reloaded had the fight scene with Neo and a plethora of Smiths which ended when Neo simply flew away using a small fighting break. Now there is only one copy of Smith able to challenge Neo: the one that captured the Oracle. So only this copy of Smith sets out to fight Neo. A third possibility is that the Smith we see fight Neo represents all of the combined power that Smith has accumulated-including the power of the Oracle.",
            "Because Neo has a choice while Smith doesn't. In the hallway during the first movie, Neo has the realization about the nature of the Matrix, that there is \"no spoon\", and he realizes he is indeed \"the one\" as the Oracle's comments about \"just knowing you're the one\" become clear. At this moment of clarity, he hacks Smith's currently-occupied avatar and leaves a type of virus (an idea of anti-authoritarian nature) on his base code, forcing him to lose control of the avatar as Neo assumes his powers of the one. In short, Neo can bend and break the rules of the Matrix.Smith, however, is still limited by the rules of his program, and condemned by his purpose in the Matrix: destroying Neo and, afterwards, destroying the entire human race. He is as powerful as Neo in terms of raw power but he lacks choice-the choice to give up or to keep fighting, the choice of attaining to another purpose, the choice of believing in something \"bigger\". What contributes to his defeat is the Oracle. While Smith believes that by absorbing the eyes of the Oracle (foreseeing of the future) would make him even stronger, he is actually being trapped by the future he foresees. He absorbs the Oracle's idea that \"No one can see beyond a choice they don't understand\". To Smith, that means he has no future since he doesn't understand Neo's capacity of choice; it is incompatible with his program and thereby destabilizes it, causing Smith and all his copies to \"crash\".There are some other theories, such as the possibility that the Machines are able to send some sort of \"anti-virus\" through Neo after he has been taken over by Smith, or that by killing Neo, they also kill Smith. This, however, begs the question why the Machines didn't do this much earlier, for instance when Smith absorbed another person who was still connected to the Matrix through the Machines; presumably, this could only be done after Neo volunteered himself (another reference to the primacy of choice) as conduit for the anti-virus, or deletion of Smith. Finally, Smith is said to be the opposite of Neo, an attempt by the Matrix to balance out the \"anomaly\" of \"the One\"; maybe the absorption of the One by Smith finally brings them together in one program or avatar, and their opposite energies cancel each other out (like matter and anti-matter), finally solving the unbalanced equation mentioned by the Architect. However, every implication is given that no Machine and no Matrix program actually anticipated its society being threatened by a Matrix program.",
            "Following the destruction of all the Smiths, the Sentinels cease their attack on Zion and return to the Machine territory. As everyone watches in amazement, Morpheus exclaims, \"He's done it!\" The Kid (Clayton Watson) carries the news that the war is over to the rest of Zion who respond with deafening cheers. Meanwhile, as Smith's changes to the Matrix are being undone, the Architect meets up with the Oracle sitting in a park under green trees and blue skies. He reminds her that she \"played a very dangerous game\" by trying to make changes in the Matrix. The Oracle assures him that the peace will last for as long as it can and makes him promise that any humans who want to be unplugged from the Matrix will be allowed to do so. As the Architect walks away, Sati (Tanveer K. Atwal), followed by Seraph, comes running out of the trees to hug the Oracle. They admire the sky, and Sati asks whether they will ever see Neo again. \"I suspect so,\" the Oracle replies, \"someday.\" Seraph asks the Oracle whether she always knew how it would end. \"No,\" she replies, \"but I believed.\"",
            "In The Matrix Reloaded, when Neo speaks with the Architect, he tells Neo: The function of the One is now to return to the Source, allowing a temporary dissemination of the code you carry, reinserting the prime program. After which you will be required to select-from the Matrix-23 individuals, 16 female, 7 male, to rebuild Zion. Failure to comply with this process will result in a cataclysmic system crash killing everyone connected to the Matrix, which coupled with the extermination of Zion will ultimately result in the extinction of the entire human race. The Architect then gives Neo a choice. The choice to go through one door which leads to him to select the 23 people, the other leading to the Matrix where Neo can save Trinity and continue the war. The latter would be considered non-compliance to which the Architect said would result in the cataclysmic system crash, killing every human connected to the Matrix.Obviously, Neo chooses \"Door Number Two\" and goes to save Trinity. Yet it doesn't appear that the Matrix crashes as the Architect claimed/expected. Note that the Architect didn't mention how soon such a crash would happen; and one of the points of the conversation at the Source was to present Neo with no more and no less than a single opportunity to make an important decision. In this film, Smith has gone on to infect every single person (and program) inside the Matrix, and the Machines are on the brink of destroying Zion. Neo then makes the choice to travel to \"the source\"-at the Machine city-and bargains with the Machines. He tells them Smith will not stop with the Matrix and will spread to the Machines themselves, effectively destroying existence for man and machine alike. Neo offers to stop Smith in exchange for peace among man and machine. The Machines agree to this and send Neo into the Matrix. Neo finally \"surrenders\" to Smith and allows Smith to infect him, and the Source sends a jolt through Neo (more or less like sending an anti-virus program through a computer, effectively deleting every infected file). This kills Neo, destroys Smith and every copy of him. Some think that this also kills every person that Smith infected, but this does not seem to be the case. Notice that as all copies of Smith \"explode\", they leave a bright spot in the overhead shot of the city. Apparently, something remains. In the following shots, we see the Oracle lying in the place of the Smith copy that infected Neo. She wasn't destroyed but restored to her original program. We can assume the same thing happened to all the other people inside the Matrix, although another possibility is that only programs were restored.Neo's return to the Machines has apparently disseminated the code, because as he is carried away (respectfully by the Machines) in the real world, the Matrix program re-initiates and everything is restored again. The Architect meets up with the Oracle, and the Oracle asks him what will happen to the \"others... the ones who want out\" (obviously referring to those still connected to the Matrix). He promises-or rather predicts-that they will be released. The Machines honor their word and leave Zion alone for the sake of peace. So the Architect was telling the truth about the expectation of Zion being destroyed and every human in the Matrix dying. However, he didn't comprehend human choice and he didn't foresee the Smith program running out of control, which resulted in Zion being left more or less intact and those inside the Matrix learning the truth, so they can choose to leave the Matrix. Remember that Morpheus said in the first movie that many people are quite comfortable with their existence inside the Matrix, something they will even defend over the truth. So, it is most likely that enough people will remain inside to provide the Machines with energy, and the rest will construct cities in the real world."

            "That is Elizabeth (Donnie's Sister's) boyfriend, Frank, the same guy who Donnie shoots in the eye after hitting Gretchen with his car.",
            "Donnie has been chosen as the Living Receiver in the Tangent Universe in which most of the movie takes place. (It starts at midnight on 10/02/1988 just before Frank the Bunny lures Donnie from his room and ends, well, at the end.)The Tangent Universe is unstable on it's own and then further glitched when The Artifact (engine) was duplicated in both universes. As Donnie was at the vortex of the creation of the Tangent Universe, it's probably why he was chosen. In this new universe, there are the Manipulated Dead (people close to the Receiver that died in the Tangent) and Manipulated Living (people close to the Receiver.) Both groups are driven by an unknown force to guide the Receiver (Donnie) to send the Artifact (engine) back to the Primary Universe so that when the Tangent Universe collapses, it can happen safely and not take the Primary Universe down with it.The Manipulated Dead are extremely powerful and have the ability to travel in time. That's why Frank lures Donnie from bed and makes him flood the school (in The Philosophy of Time Travel - PoTT - water is an energy used to create a portal and the flooding led to school being cancelled thus led to him walking Gretchen home) and burn down Jim Cunningham's house (which led to a sequence of events the cumulated with Donnie and his sister throwing that costume party setting up the final part of the film) As the film goes on and Donnie reads PoTT, he becomes more aware of why he's being driven to do these things.The Manipulated Dead know that the Tangent Universe will collapse and all existence in all universes will be destroyed and thus use their powers to travel back in time and use Donnie. The Manipulated Living are also leading Donnie to his fate but do not realise it.Everything that happens in the Tangent Universe happens for the reason of Donnie sending the Artifact back to the Primary Universe in order to save the Primary Universe.",
            "Richard Kelly states this in the DVD commentary (with Jake Gyllenhal): Donnie laughs for the same reason the other characters were reflective at the end. As explained in the POTT, they have some memory, if not of details than of a feeling by way of dreams. It could be that he woke from these dreams and felt relieved. Or that he found peace. Or that he didn't realise he was about to die.He had to die, so his girlfriend doesn't die in the future. He did it to save her life.",
            "Human and Bunny Frank are the same. The bunny costume is always inhabited by Frank, though we do briefly see Frank outside of the costume. He is Elizabeth's boyfriend in both the Primary and Tangent Universes.Now here's where it gets complicated - there are essentially three versions of Frank.The first is Frank in the Primary Universe. We only see him in the very ending montage of the film (more on that later.)Then there is the Tangent Universe, in which most of the film takes place. We first see him lure Donnie out of bed so he's not crushed by the jet engine (the Artifact.) This is the Manipulated Dead Frank. He was made a Manipulated Dead after his Tangent Universe counterpart is killed shortly before the Tangent Universe is to collapse. Manipulated Dead are very powerful and have the ability to travel through time.So, Manipulated Dead Frank (we'll call him MD Frank) having been killed, travels back a few weeks in time to when the the Tangent Universe was created, to Donnie's bedroom, and makes sure Tangent Universe Donnie is not killed by the Artifact. This is because Donnie is the Living Receiver - chosen by an unknown force and tasked to return the Artifact to the Primary Universe so that all existence doesn't collapse.MD Frank is aided by other Manipulated Dead and by Manipulated Living. Manipulated Living make decisions and perform actions to guide Donnie as well, but they're not aware of it.In the theatre scene, MD Frank takes of the bunny head and reveals his eye is shot out.Towards the end of the movie, when Donnie, Gretchen, and his friends go to Roberta Sparrow's house and are attacked by the two bullies, a car comes racing down the street and runs over Gretchen, killing her. The driver of the car is Tangent Universe Frank before he's killed. Donnie shoots him in the eye, killing him. MD Frank is watching from the bushes. All this leads to Donnie ultimately succeeding in his mission to return the Artifact and allow the Tangent Universe to collapse safely and the Primary Universe to once again be, primary.Back in the Primary Universe, the characters seem to have some deja vu memories from dreams on what happened in the Tangent Universe. In the closing montage, we see Primary Universe Frank drawing the bunny mask over and over and looking troubled as he lifts a hand and touches his eye.",
            "There are two Manipulated Dead in the Tangent Universe. The Manipulated Dead are people close to the Living Receiver (Donnie) that died while in the Tangent Universe. These two people are Frank and Gretchen. As Manipulated Dead, they have great power, including time travel, and use this power to guide Donnie to return the Artifact (jet engine) to the Primary Universe so that the Tangent Universe can collapse safely without taking the Primary Universe with it.",
            "Not exactly, but kind of. The Philosophy of Time Travel's final chapter is about dreams. Survivors of the Tangent Universe are often haunted by dreams about what happened and experience Deja Vu. However, they don't recollect everything and see it as nightmares and odd phenomenon.",
            "Similar to the previous connection, it's believed that she feels some sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu when she sees Rose. We don't know if Rose or Gretchen ever met in the Tangent Universe, but even so, she might feel some connection with her and Donnie's family, in a similar d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu sense. After the scene of Donnie and his family discussing the Philosophy of Time Travel, you see Donnie and a girl in overalls jumping on a trampoline. You see Gretchen wearing something extremely similar to this after the second crash of the jet engine where she waves to Donnie's mother. This may be evidence of Gretchen and Donnie's mom/family having met before.",
            "She's concerned that Donnie might be on the verge of a psychotic breakdown. She may also, as a Manipulated Living, subconsciously realise that the collapse of the Tangent Universe is coming.",
            "It's implied that her mother was abducted by her ex-husband, Gretchen's father. Earlier in the film, Gretchen mentions to Donnie that her dad stabbed her mom in the chest four times and they had to move and choose new names.It's never revealed what actually happened to her mom that night because it's just several hours from the collapse of the Tangent Universe. There aren't any clues if the same thing happened in the Primary Universe, or, if Gretchen, being one of the Manipulated Dead, was telling the truth."

            "Following his aborted meeting with Bourne on the Pont Neuf, the CIA's head of Treadstone, Alexander Conklin (Chris Cooper), heads over to the Treadstone safehouse where logistics technician Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) has begun to shut down the surveillance equipment and close down the unit. Bourne follows Conklin and breaks into the safehouse. He questions Conklin about Treadstone and his identity and, from the answers, he slowly begins to remember how he created the cover of John Michael Kane and planned the assassination of exiled African dictator Nykwana Wombosi (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) on his yacht but couldn't do it because Wombosi's children were sleeping nearby. In fleeing the yacht, he was shot twice in the back. Bourne tells Conklin that he is done with Treadstone and orders him to relay the news that he died two weeks ago. He leaves the safehouse, having to fight his way through several operatives awaiting him in the stairwell but manages to get away. When Conklin follows, he is assassinated by another operative, code name Manheim (Russell Levy), dispatched by the CIA's Deputy Director Ward Abbott (Brian Cox). Later, at a oversight committee meeting, Abbott informs the members that Treadstone has been shut down and proposes a new project to be called Blackbriar. In the final scene, Bourne tracks down Marie, who is now running a scooter rental shop in Mykonos, Greece.",
            "Abbott had Conklin killed because Conklin was steadily becoming incapable of controlling Treadstone, an unsanctioned program that needed to be kept under wraps. Abbott was already worried when Wombosi told the press that he believed the CIA had sent an assassin to kill him. When Bourne surfaced in Zurich and Paris and started causing damage, Abbott became desperate to stop Treadstone from being exposed. He did not have faith in Conklin's ability to deal with Bourne, so he sent an \"asset\" (assassin) to have Conklin killed.",
            "The assumption is that, when he saw Wombosi holding his children, something clicked. Although Bourne was trained to be a cold-hearted assassin, he suddenly regained his humanity. Another explanation is that he realized he would have to kill the children, too, so as to leave no witnesses, and he just couldn't do that. In the novel, it is further explained that Bourne became an operative after his own family, including his young children, was killed, that possibly being the trigger that prevented him from killing Wombosi and his children."

Remembering his wife's words just before she died six months earlier, Graham tells Merrill to \"swing away.\" Merrill grabs his baseball bat and begins swinging just as the alien sprays Morgan with his poisonous gas. The alien drops Morgan on the floor, and Merrill keeps swinging. The alien falls against a bureau and knocks a glass of Bo's undrinkable water on himself, causing his skin to turn red and blister. Merrill keeps swinging away, knocking over more glasses of water, as Graham takes Morgan and Bo outside.

People live and thrive in inhospitable environments on earth all the time. The sea is very unforgiving, but sailors manage to survive. Deserts and the Arctic north are very nasty places to live but people are there as well. The concept of aliens coming to Earth and finding a hostile environment is not new in film and literature; consider The War of the Worlds (1953), where they didn't anticipate that germs, like the common cold, could kill them. Another possibility is that the aliens were not harmed by the water itself but what was in the water. Bo talking about how her water was contaminated is a big hint. Since the Industrial Revolution, real water worldwide, has not been that pure.",
            "Water vapor may have affected the aliens, but this is not shown in the film. Liquid water is more concentrated than that of water vapor and was shown to have a corrosive affect on their skin. Possibly, as the relative humidity approached 100%, the aliens would be at greater risk. Based on the radio report, the aliens left behind were injured in some way. It can be argued that these were the aliens that were most severely affected by water. The rest may have been able to tolerate small exposures.",
            "They were armed. They had a gas weapon that appeared to be part of the alien's arm (or suit), like a snake spitting venom or like a human using teeth or fingernails as weapons. Hubris, ignorance or stupidity may have prevented them from carrying more advanced weapons. Given their level of technological superiority, they may not have considered humans much of a threat and so armed themselves accordingly. The film references this aspect explicitly. As Morgan is giving his father an outline of the information he has gleaned from a book on aliens, Hess asks Morgan, \"Did this book of yours say what might happen if they were hostile?\" \"Yes,\" Morgan replies, \"it said they would probably invade.

He explains that he can't take a soul that's without sin and that Dodge committed murder (likely referring to Dodge shooting Ferriman). There is a flaw with that argument, however. Dodge shot Ferriman in self-defense which is quite often not considered a sin. Also, the fact that Ferriman can't be killed, at least with modern firearms, means that Dodge hadn't committed murder.

            "It could be a result of exhaustion. Throughout the first act of the film, we see Peter under constant stress from and anxiety about his job, money, family and his duties as Spider-Man. All of this could contribute to his powers weakening. Originally, Ock was going to plant an inhibitor chip in Peter.It can also be metaphorical for us losing control over ourselves when we are depressed",
            "It's possible that the doctor knows Peter is Spider-Man based on this encounter and Peter's nervous disposition. However, like the many passengers on the subway that Peter stops from crashing later in the movie and who discover his identity but keep it a secret, the doctor doesn't wish to report it or reveal his identity because he understands the good Peter does for his city. It's not beyond the realm of belief that there are people in the world who are intrinsically good and moral and they see Spider-Man as something positive and wish to keep his identity a secret.On the other hand, the doctor could be interpreting Peter's story as what he says it is: a dream. And the entire scene could just be playing in earnest with the doctor unwittingly interpreting the duality of Peter and Spider-Man.",
            "This is debatable, but the most rational answer is that Doctor Octopus' actions were the result of his wife's death (which he blames on Spider-Man) and the persuasive and murderous intentions of the tentacle arms which he had no control over after the inhibitor chip was destroyed in the blast. He was really acting out of grief and it's only by the film's end that he realizes what he has done and is able to use his own willpower to take control of his creation again.After the chip got destroyed, Otto lost control over the tentacles, and instead they started controlling him. The first experience the tentacles had was a room full of surgeons trying to saw them off. After the tentacles manage to save themselves and Otto, outside the policemen started shooting at them. Naturally they were traumtised from all this. And this affected Otto negatively too since the arms were in control of him. Otto himself was desperate for his experiment too. He is convinced by the tentacles that his experiment was working until Spider Man messed it up. Thus he convinces himself that the \"real crime\" would be, not to rob a bank, but to not finish what he started. Thus he decides to leave no stone unturned to get his fusion reaction successful, and also hates Spider Man.",
            "There are really two reasons why Peter doesn't try to explain his innocence at this point in the movie (and series) to Harry.1. At this point in the film, time is of the essence for Peter. He needs to track down Doctor Octopus as soon as possible before he destroys the city with his nuclear reactor.2. Throughout the film, Harry has been extremely bitter and depressed about his father's death. Add to this his fractured relationship with Peter as a result of Peter's closeness to Spiderman and you realize that no matter what kind of explanation Peter could give him, Harry wouldn't believe him anyway. He has demonstrated his unwillingness to accept any other alternative to the events of his father's death and it isn't until the events of Spider-Man 3 that Harry finally learns the truth and is able to let it all go.3) It was Norman Osborn's last wish to Peter- \"Don't tell Harry.\" Peter was simply respecting it. Harry was already suffering terribly for his father's death, and to know that his father was a murderous psychopath would only make him feel more horrible."

            "To get cursed you have to remove the coins from the chest itself. Bootstrap Bill (Will's father) was the one who originally took the coin, thus it was he who had the curse-not Will (to whom he sent the coin) and not Elizabeth (who took it from Will after they found him floating at sea). When Elizabeth retrieved the coin back directly on the Isla de Muerta, it was Barbossa who removed it from the chest first, but he was cursed already.",
            "Barbossa is shot by Jack after the curse is lifted, The blood repaid had already occurred off screen, Jack tosses the coin to Will who, like Jack slices his hand and bleeds on the medallion repaying Bootstraps blood owed. Pintel is alive cause he was shot before the curse was lifted. Hence the dialogue of:(Jack fires his pistol at Barbossa.)Barbossa: (looks at Jack.) \"Ten years, you been carrying that pistol and you waste your shot?\"Will: \"He didn't waste it.\" (holds a bloody knife and drops Jack's coin and his dad's medallion into the chest, both smeared with blood.)",
            "There are several possible reasons: (1) Barbossa is a gentleman and it was beneath his sense of \"honor\" to kill an innocent and brave woman, (2) he took a liking to Elisabeth and did not want to hurt her, and (3) the pirates intended to use her to satisfy their \"lust\" since they had not been able to do so since the curse was forced upon them. Hence his line \"Waste not.\" (4) Barbossa simply didn't feel it was necessary to cut someone's throat to complete the ritual. Once Elisabeth's blood didn't work, Koehler suggests cutting her throat and spilling all her blood, just to make sure. But Elisabeth had already admitted that William Turner wasn't her father, so Barbossa knew it was pointless.",
            "As they read off the list of Jack's crimes piracy, smuggling, impersonating an officer of the Spanish Royal Navy, impersonating a cleric of the Church of England, sailing under false colours, arson, kidnapping, looting, poaching, brigandage, pilfering, depravity, depredation, and general lawlessness Will makes his way toward the gallows. When the hangman releases the trap door, Will tosses his sword into the hanging post just under Jack's feet, giving him a foothold until Will can get close enough to cut him down. A general riot breaks out as Jack and Will defend themselves against the British Navy. Governor Swann and Commodore Norrington confront Will, who stands between them and Jack. When Elizabeth also joins Will in an attempt to protect Jack, the Governor orders the Army to stand down. Meanwhile, Jack has been slowly backing up until he falls off the rampart and into the water below just as the Black Pearl rounds the rocks. Norrington realizes that it is Will whom Elizabeth loves and admits his defeat by admiring the quality of Will's sword and assuring himself that \"The man who made it would show the same care and devotion in every aspect of his life.\" When asked what to do about Jack Sparrow, Norrington replies, \"I think we can afford to give him one day's head start.\" Jack swims out to the ship and is pulled aboard by his crew. They sail off toward the horizon. In the final scene, the little capuchin monkey back in the cave takes a medallion from the box of gold and is instantly skeletonized in the moonlight, reawakening the curse.",
            "This is never explained in any of the movies but several theories exist.\nThe first is that Gibbs was disgraced from the Royal Navy for one reason or another such as his constant drinking even when on Duty.\nThe second: Gibbs yearned for a free life and quit the Navy after a few years seeing how tyrannical they were, which inspired him to become a pirate.\nThe third: Gibbs was always secretly a pirate or sympathetic to their cause and simply acted as if against them in order to not be discovered.\nThe fourth: Gibbs had let a pirate go free (likely Jack) from his custody, making him no longer welcome in the Navy and perhaps law-abiding society altogether. This theory is fairly likely, since likewise occurs to James Norrington in the sequel, Dead Man's Chest. Norrington therein says, \"My story is exactly the same as your story, except one chapter behind.\" As we know, Norrington let Jack get a head start on his escape, which eventually lead to Norrington being ejected from the Navy and a warrant issued for his arrest, forcing him to join a pirate crew."

So skilled that nobody has ever been able to land a single blow on him. The closest anyone had ever gotten was Hector, when he manages to scrape Achilles' chest armour with his sword. So legend would spread among the soldier and citizens that Achilles couldn't be hurt or killed.At the end of the film, Paris hits Achilles in the back of the heel with an arrow (known today as the Achilles tendon, now you know why!), then hits him in the torso with several more arrows. Achilles pulls out all of the arrows except the one in his heel, before dying. So when his body was found, he would be found with the single arrow in the back of his heel.

            "Hicox (Michael Fassbender) already learned about Operation Kino from Fenech (Mike Myers). The Basterds had the guns and dynamite ready. Later, von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger) tells Raine (Brad Pitt) that she had arranged for a tailor to get Hicox, Stiglitz (Til Schweiger) and Wicki (Gedeon Burkhard) fitted for tuxedos. They could have taken care of this, and hashed out any further details of Operation Kino in a private setting (even at the tailor's shop).Fenech and von Hammersmark mentioned that the area around the tavern would be clear of Nazis. Also, meeting at a private place such as a hotel room may have been inconvenient for all parties, and von Hammersmark could have drawn attention as she is a famous actress in Germany. The guise of a couple German soldiers, assigned to be her escort to the movie premier and meeting for a drink at a tavern is much less suspect then each of them sneaking off somewhere secretive. Especially in case von Hammersmark was being followed.",
            "Viewers have suggested that (1) Landa (Christoph Waltz) admired Shosanna's will for survival, (2) the distance between them was too great for an accurate shot, (3) Landa wanted her to spread the rumors of him being \"the Jew Hunter\", (4) he had no doubt that he could track her down at a later time, and (5) he didn't want to shoot her in the back (mentioned in the script, but left out of the movie). In the \"Cannes cut\", he informs his soldiers that she will freeze to death anyway in the coming winter.",
            "Likely not. While Landa is a bit of a sociopath, he also seems to keep his word when he promises LaPadite he won't kill him if he turns over the Dreyfuses. Landa was a brilliant detective, while at the beginning of the film, he says he loves his unofficial title of \"The Jew Hunter\" because he has earned it. Yet late in the film, when Aldo refers to Landa by this name, Landa is disgusted by it, because at this point, he was no longer \"hunting Jews\" so to speak and could be honest with Raine (though given his opportunistic nature, it could also be the possibility he claims to dislike his title as to appear a better person in front of the Allied Forces). So, at the beginning, he already knew that Mr. LaPadite was hiding the Jews beneath his floorboards, but Landa promised him that if he were to make Landa's job easier and admit it, that the German army would never bother him or his family again. LaPadite, put in an impossible position, reluctantly confesses and Landa has the Dreyfus family hidden beneath the floorboards executed, with the exception of Shosanna. Landa would likely want LaPadite to spread the story of what happened, so he would let him and his family live. Also, if one gains a reputation for being true to their word, it's more likely someone in the future would give up information easier upon promise of their life. If Landa went around killing everyone who was helping Jews, he would gain a reputation as such, therefore eventually someone would know that they were dead either way and likely try and kill Landa in the process. Also, Tarantino has a recurring theme of honour in his movies. When a character, even a villain, gives their word, they tend to keep it.",
            "While Tarantino has made it pretty clear that in his film's world, Hitler was gunned down in the movie theater and didn't meet his real life fate, thus helping to end the war, fans have nevertheless put forth a theory that perhaps it was a double that was killed in the theater, or perhaps the actual Hitler was killed but a double \"assumed the throne\" and continued until committing suicide in the bunker in 1945. However, this would not account for the other members of Hitler's inner circle who were killed in the theater, such as Bormann, G\u00f6ring and Goebbels. It would be a little too convenient for them to have doubles, as well. In historical reality, Hitler visited Paris only one time for a single day, when he traveled there to accept the French surrender in June 1940.",
            "The Sergeant from the baseball bat scene (Sgt. Werner Rachtman) said that \"Everyone in the German Army has heard of Hugo Stiglitz.\" that doesn't mean that he was so famous everyone would instantly recognize him. His picture was in the paper, yes. But the rumours and stories about Stiglitz would likely mainly travel by word-of-mouth throughout the ranks of the German Army. Even if a good portion of the army saw Hugo's picture in the newspaper, he doesn't have any real distinct features that make him stand out in a crowd. Also it was said that instead of being executed he was to be sent to Berlin to be made an example of. Once the Basterds rescued him, Hitler's propaganda probably wouldn't want this to be found out (Keep in mind that is just theorizing) so they kept it quiet so most German Soldiers probably assumed he was back in Berlin. So when they see a man that looks much like Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz, but is in a Lieutenant's uniform, they may just think \"hey he looks familiar\" or \"Hey he looks like Stiglitz\" All the soldiers in the Tavern were very drunk and paid little or no attention to him as he also sat with his back to them. Hellstrom on the other hand, would likely know who Stiglitz was, as he was a Gestapo officer. But once again, may have assumed this man just looked like Stiglitz or paid little or no attention to him as he was focusing his suspicions on Hicox and his \"bizarre accent\".",
            "Relying on what is shown or implied in the movie, we can say that it is possible. He never saw her face while she was running away from him, so there is no way he could have known that she was the girl, although we don't know how detailed were the files Landa had on the Dreyfus family. It is possible he had a very good description of her or even a photo. Being a very skilled detective and interrogator, he acts as polite and respectful as possible and never shows all his cards until he is certain about the outcome. The beginning of the film showed Landa having a friendly conversation with Monsieur LaPadite whom he suspected of hiding the Dreyfus family, but asked for certain details about them to see how Mr. LaPadite responded, pretending to not really be sure about the details of the Dreyfus family was hint enough for Landa to know he was lying and confirm that LaPadite was hiding the Dreyfuses. Keep in mind that Landa also knew who Aldo, Donny and Omar were simply by interrogating the swastika marked soldiers. So he could very easily have known or suspected that Madame Mimieux was in fact Shosanna Dreyfus, simply by height, hair colour, eye colour and descriptions he had gathered from interrogations of other Dairy Farmers in the area. Perhaps the reason he ordered the milk and the cream was that he suspected she was Jewish, but as she kept her calm and even tried the strudel, cream and all, he either dismissed his theory or chose to ignore it. It's also possible, going with the assumption that Landa did indeed know who she was, that Landa was just testing her nerves. The more he prolonged the stress of him sitting there with her, the more uncomfortable she'd likely become. Not to mention she probably didn't have much of an appetite with him sitting there. While she kept her calm, it was also obvious she was still nervous. Perhaps when he said he had something else to ask her-then he paused-and gave her an intense stare was just to gauge her reaction. As a cat toys with a mouse. Either for his own amusement or to see if she would try running at which point he could apprehend her. He may have chosen not to act on his suspicions because he was planning on betraying Hitler at the theater, and could have used Shosanna as a scapegoat had it not gone as planned. Though that is just a theory.",
            "We have no way of knowing, as he never asked the question. It's entirely possible he was suspicious and simply toying with her. It's also possible he was considering confronting her about his suspicions but at the last moment decided not to act on them.",
            "The following people are involved in the shoot out: Bridget Von Hammersmark, Hugo Stiglitz, Wilhelm Wicki, Archie Hicox, Major Hellstrom, Wilhelm, the German soldiers identified by their game cards on their foreheads; Winnetou, Mata Hari, Edgar Wallace, Beethoven (Female Soldier), Eric the Bartender, and Eric's daughter Mathilda the waitress. Things are very confusing given that the events of the main shootout all happen in under 35 seconds:1. Stiglitz starts things off by telling Hellstrom to say \"auf Wiedersehen\" to his Nazi balls, then shoots him in his groin.2. Hellstrom then shoots Hicox in turn and hits Bridget in the leg, who falls backward in her chair, while Hicox falls backward and returns fire at Hellstrom.3. Stiglitz then stands up and repeatedly stabs Hellstrom in the back of the head, pinning his head to the table.4. Wicki stands up and shoots Winnetou in the back at least twice.5. Beethoven shoots Stiglitz in the back.6. Mata Hari shoots Wicki in the stomach.7. Stiglitz turns and shoots Beethoven four times in the torso and then also shoots Edgar Wallace in the heart, killing them both.8. Wicki shoots Mata Hari in the heart.9. Eric shoots Stiglitz with a double-barreled shotgun, killing him. (Note: this is the only shot that isn't definitive as there is an extreme close-up of Eric while he takes aim, but when there is a wide shot of him, he appears to be aiming in Stiglitz' direction. It was theorized he was shooting at the Germans, but Wicki wouldn't have shot him if that was so).10. Wicki shoots Eric in the head.11. Wilhelm blindly guns down Wicki and Mathilda with his MP40 submachine gun. (The way the final shot is filmed, it's possible Wilhelm also shot Mata Hari in the back, or it could have just been editing of Wicki finishing him off.)12. After Wilhelm agrees to surrender to the Basterds, Bridget retrieves Hicox's pistol and fires four shots at Wilhelm, hitting him at least twice in the chest, killing him.",
            "Being a member of the Gestapo, Hellstrom was suspicious of Hicox after overhearing his \"bizarre accent\". Hicox explains why he has an accent pretty smoothly (that he was from a different part of Germany from a small rural village at the foot of the Piz Pal\u00fc mountain in the Bernina Range of the Alps, located between Switzerland and Italy). Since people in Germany indeed speak in various \"high German\" (southern Bavaria accents) and \"low German\" (northern German accents) as well as have strong accents and dialects in neighboring German-speaking countries such as Austria and Switzerland, Hicox may have convinced Hellstrom he was truly a German. So, Hellstrom joins them for a conversation and for a card game. Hellstrom likely picked up something on Hicox again for not really wanting to play the game, then asking Hellstrom to leave the table after one round. When Hellstrom acts offended, Hicox clams up. Hellstrom then starts laughing and says he was joking and says that he would like to buy them all one round of drinks and then he would leave them alone. When Eric the bartender asks how much whisky, Hicox says, \"Drei Gl\u00e4ser\" (three glasses), and holds three fingers up. He holds his index, middle and ring finger up. Both Hellstrom and Von Hammersmark notice this immediately. Notice how Hellstrom's facial expression and cheerful demeanor quickly goes stiff and silent, and Von Hammersmark looks mortified. Hicox inadvertently gave himself away by ordering \"three glasses\" with those particular fingers. A German would order \"three\" with the index, middle finger and the thumb extended. The other way looks odd, and a German would indeed notice it as Von Hammersmark later comments.",
            "While Aldo struck a deal with Wilhelm, (we are shown Aldo to be a man of his word) Bridget Von Hammersmark did not. Hicox had also warned Aldo earlier, If we get into trouble, we can handle it. But if trouble does happen, we need you to make damn sure that no Germans or French for that matter escape from that basement. If Frau Von Hammersmark's cover is compromised; the mission is kaput. While not explicitly stated, it's likely Hicox meant kill anyone trying to escape so as not to risk them reporting Von Hammersmark as an Allied spy. He could have just meant capture them (which is likely what Aldo was going to do with Wilhelm). However holding an enemy prisoner when in an area heavily populated by the enemy is extremely risky. So it's likely Bridget knew she had the drop on Wilhelm and decided to take him out so she didn't have to worry about Aldo taking him alive, especially after Wilhelm insulted her and called her a \"traitor\". Bridget was probably also a tad upset that he just aided in killing her allies and even an innocent waitress.",
            "Sgt Donny Donowitz (Eli Roth) and Pfc Omar Ulmer (Omar Doom) wanted to make sure they were the ones who killed Hitler and his staff. When they quickly became aware that the theater was on fire, they may have also realized that all the exits were blocked so they decided to go out in a blaze of glory, taking as many Nazis with them before they all died. A second explanation is that they may have gotten so caught up in the moment and were so focused on the killing that they probably forgot about the time left on the bombs strapped to their legs as all three bombs exploded simultaneously.",
            "At the beginning of the film, Shosanna doesn't speak or understand English, but the rest of the film takes place three to four years later which is more than enough time for her to learn English, possibly to avoid another situation like the beginning of the film. Also, it has been mentioned in many books that Adolf Hitler may have known a little bit of English (probably not French), so Shosanna might have wanted Hitler to understand the words she spoke (as shown when Hitler stands up and angrily shouts out \"Enough! Stop (the film)!\" after her film announces all the Nazis in the theater are going to die). Lastly, Shosanna's use of English is a simple continuity choice, as it is meant as a direct response to Frederick Zoller's line \"Who wants to send a message to Germany?\", which is spoken in English. The technical answer is that the scene was originally supposed to be in French, but M\u00e9lanie Laurent suggested to Quentin Tarantino that it be done in English. Most likely because it would be hard to read subtitles during all the chaos.",
            "Marcel isn't seen after lighting the fire in the theater, but it is assumed he escaped through the exit behind the screen as he had to go outside the theater to enter through this door behind the screen likely to meet up with Shosanna outside. He may also have died, as the bittersweet last kiss between Shosanna and himself could imply that they were on a suicide mission. This is unlikely, however, as both of them had access to the outside (Marcel only locked the theater doors to the auditorium, not the doors leading to the outside), and Shoshanna could have left the projector room and escaped through the front door.",
            "At first it would seem he did this because she betrayed her country, yet Landa was already planning to do the same thing, so it's likely he didn't want to share the credit and reward with someone. Had he let her live, she would receive credit for getting the Basterds into the premier and Landa would only have gotten credit for not stopping them. But if the person who got them into the premier was dead, then how they got in was a moot point and Landa would receive all the credit for helping the Basterds carry out their mission. Alternatively; perhaps it would be one last cold-blooded murder he could get away with before \"surrendering\" to the Allies.",
            "The Basterds, although cruel and brutal, still had their honesty. Not only that, but they were given orders by a higher authority. Raine was heard saying that what Landa was going to do would make up for the atrocities he has committed. \"Death and nature illuminate, elevate; love ventures under, the rest all never\" implies something in which Raine highly believes: giving the Nazis/German soldiers what they deserve. Landa did follow through on his side of the deal. Thus, it is not surprising when Raine and company decide to follow orders and not break their word/honor by taking Landa's life. On the other hand, you could also say that Raine wanted to brand Landa a Nazi, a memento he would have to shamefully carry on his forehead for the rest of his life, a stark contrast to the war hero who caused Hitler's reign to end.",
            "By the end of the film, Landa could see that in the situation where Hitler was inevitably going to die, and hence the Nazis were not going to win the war, he made the decision to betray Hitler. He goes to Raine to seek out a way to make him look like a hero. Landa traded Raine's life to hopefully be a permanent part of the history books, as the man who killed Hitler and ended the war singlehandedly. Had Germany continued winning the war and the history books been written by the Third Reich, Landa would be famous as \"the Jew Hunter\" and held in high regard for the future generations of people brought up with the ideals of the Nazis. Simply put, Landa didn't care which side he was on, as long as it was the winning side.",
            "The first soldier to be branded wasn't shown, simply the scar that was left. Although Aldo usually went just deep enough to leave a visible scar, he felt that Landa deserved a little more than the usual, considering the atrocities he committed. He also wanted to make sure anyone who met Landa would see the \"brand\" and recognize him for what he was. Consequently, Aldo dug his knife so deeply into Landa's forehead that it was basically carved into the skull, which is why Landa was in such agony. Aldo also seemed to do it a bit slower in order to maximize Landa's agony. This is probably why Aldo believes it to be his \"masterpiece\". Alternatively, it's also possible that Landa is just a sniveling coward. He is more than happy to dish out torment and death on others and is \"brave\" enough to kill a defenseless woman with his bare hands, but when it comes to actually receiving a taste of pain himself, it's more than he could take.",
            "No, this film is entirely fictional and essentially fantasy. In reality, the generally accepted cause of Hitler's death on 30 April 1945 is suicide by gunshot and cyanide poisoning. Although the UK employed Jewish commandos in a group called X-Troop, those fighters committed none of the acts shown in this film. Christoph Waltz has stated that the film is \"a piece of art. Not a history lesson.\"",
            "Yes. Tarantino keeps his tradition of giving himself a small role in his films. In fact, he appears twice. First, he appears as one of the scalped German bodies when the Basterds are interrogating the Germans in the ditch, and later appears as a soldier in \"Nation's Pride,\" (the one that says Colonel, I implore you, we must destroy that tower!\") the movie being shown at the theater at the end. Nation's Pride was directed by Eli Roth, who appears as Donnie. When Landa chokes Hammersmark, the hands around her neck in closeup are Tarantino's."

            "No, because Quinn had picked up a dead soldier's pistol, and even shot the Celtic Predator in the shoulder. He then fought an uncloaked Celtic on the surface, had been injured as a result of the engagement and had proven his worthiness in combat. Furthermore, he also knew of the Predators' presence. It could also be that Scar saw this as a 'mercy kill' as he recognised that Quinn had no hope of survival due to his injuries and the cold.",
            "If you mean where she's using the skull as a \"shield\" of sorts, then the obvious answer is that it was cleaned. The train of logic follows thus: We know the blood is acidic, but not the exoskeleton. As such, if one component of the Alien is not acidic (or otherwise obviously fatal to non-Aliens), it stands that others are not, either, such as the interior lining of the exoskeleton. It's like you take a football helmet full of battery acid. The acid is bad, but you can take the time to clean it and make the helmet usable. It stands to reason that a species who has dealt with these Aliens for eons would know how to make the skull usable and/or have technology that would do it.\nAlso, think back to the first movie. when they find the dead facehugger at that point it's mentioned that its acidic blood neutralizes after its death. So it's natural to assume the later stages of the species do similarly after they die, which makes the scene in the fourth Alien movie where two drones kill a third so its acidic blood will eat through the floor even more acceptable presumably, they were careful to keep it alive while they were gutting it to ensure the acid would remain potent as long as possible.",
            "Yes, that's exactly what the aliens would do. They would swim hundreds of miles to populated land, infesting whatever life-form they can find along the way. There are two things to remember here: Aliens don't just hatch from humans, and they are incredibly resilient to environmental conditions. Even the vacuum of space isn't quite enough to kill the one in the first Alien film.",
            "In the first Predator film, the hunter activates a self-destruct that according to Peter Keyes in Predator 2, \"eliminated enough rain forest to cover 300 City blocks.\". Which likely means a blast radius of 7.5 miles in diameter. In comparison, the blast radius of the nuclear bomb that hit Hiroshima was only 1 mile in diameter. So that was a significant blast radius of a lone hunter. Combine that with the enclosed setting of temple, would amplify the explosion.In Predator, the hunter was alone hunting humans on their own planet. He only needed to eliminate himself and his technology to stop it from getting into human hands. He didn't need to wipe out anything but himself. This is similar to the real life practice of scuttling a navel ship to prevent its capture. In AvP, the hunters would need to stop the alien infestation from spreading across the planet. The hunters respect humans and value them as prey, but if the aliens got loose they would easily overtake the planet wiping out humanity, as is constantly warned about in the Alien films. If the hunters couldn't handle a small area overrun by aliens then an entire planet of aliens would be a deathtrap leaving it useless to them. The hunters are not interested in wiping out humanity, as this would eliminate a valued prey, but know they need to protect them from the hunters' own errors. Essentially, it's a last resort method to fix the problems they caused. This idea is explored in the second AvP film where a hunter hunts down and removes all traces of the aliens to protect Earth and humanity after his fellow hunters failed to stop aliens from coming to human civilization.",
            "The hunting ritual did not go as planned; the humans were not supposed to take the plasma cannons, the Predators were. The Predators were taking part in a \"coming of age\" ritual and were quite young (technically analogous to human teenagers). However, there were still humans running around in the pyramid who were keeping the Predators too busy to be minding the Aliens. Normally, there would only be enough people for breeding Aliens, and they would be dead already when the hunt began. The first Predator was distracted by Lex so that the Alien was able to stab him in the back. The second Predator got careless towards the end of his fight with the main Alien. He likely assumed the Alien was trapped in the net and helpless, but the Alien broke free as the Predator was about to strike the final blow. According to AvP backstory, no Predator has survived a fight with an Alien with only its wristblades with the exception of Daschende/Broken Tusk from the original AvP comic book. Basically, the circumstances were difficult in this particular hunt, and these Predators simply lacked the experience to effectively cope with it.",
            "At best, the only human survivor from this movie is Lex, who was left alone on the island after the Predator ship took off, making it possible that she died there. But if she did survive, most likely no one believed her story. She was there on behalf of Weyland, so anything she tells the company will be kept under wraps. Soon after, the Yutani Corp gains video footage of one of the Aliens from Gunnison and a piece of Predator technology (through Colonel Stevens in AVPR, who worked for the same unit as Peter Keys from Predator 2). In Alien, the Weyland-Yutani Corporation knew of the existence of the Aliens for some time, but they chose to keep it under wraps so they could use them for their own means; the crew of the Nostromo were not supposed to know about it, except Ash (Special Order 937 was for \"Science Officer Eyes Only\").",
            "It's interesting to note, that in the AvP canon, the predators all have acid-proof armor and weapons. However in this film, when Celtic Predator was fighting the Alien, his wrist blade melts away after using it on an alien, then he gets some acid on his armor and it starts to melt. However, Scar Predator used his wrist-blades and many other weapons on the Aliens and they didn't melt at all. (We never see Gill/Chopper Predator use his gear because he was killed too quickly). This could have partly meant why the ritual went awry so fast is that the team leader (Celtic) was not properly equipped for the hunt, he may have grabbed the gear for hunting humans instead of the gear for hunting aliens, or there was a supply mixup. (This would explain why he paused to look at what was left of his wrist-blades and seemed surprised that they had melted.) It is not uncommon for Earth militaries to accidentally send the wrong, or defective, equipment into a battlefield, so what's to say the Predators' Warrant Officers and other supply personnel don't make mistakes? It's possible that Scar was the only one who knew about the acidic blood; he might have been the only one who actually did his homework and researched the Aliens, either forgetting or choosing not to pass the relevant information on to the other two (like a group of University roommates where only one actually studies).",
            "It's a direct nod to the original AvP comics, which was the inspiration for both this film and the video games. In the comic book, the lead Predator protects the humans from both Alien and Predators because they found him unconscious and wounded and nursed him back to health. That Predator however, never killed any humans. The Predators are not mindless killers. Although ruthless, they definitely have a strong sense of honor and ethics. Remember that Dutch from Predator was at the direct mercy of a Predator and could have been easily killed, but he was ultimately granted the opportunity to a \"fair\" fight (without lasers and stabbing weapons anyway) because that Predator probably judged him as a worthy prey, respecting him for putting up such a good fight. Lt. Harrigan (Danny Glover) from Predator 2 managed to kill a Predator, and was left alive by its brethren out of respect. He even got a trophy for it. Also, Royce from Predators freed a Predator from captivity, after which it grabbed his neck, but decided against killing him, since it owed its freedom to him. It can be concluded that traditional Predators work on some sort of honour system.In this film, the Predator Scar kills some humans without hesitation (like he does with Max Stafford). When he confronts Lex, he is ready to kill her (he actually yells at her, probably hoping she will run, as it is no sport to kill an immobile prey). But then she gives him his shoulder cannon. So at this point he is probably thankful for the gun, or he sees her as a human servant, unworthy as prey. Then the Predator is suddenly attacked by a xenomorph and knocked unconscious; Lex, however, was quick enough to grab a spear and impale the Alien as it lunged toward her. So in a sense, Lex has saved Scar's life, and his honor may dictate that he help and save her in return. He may also see her as something of an equal, recognizing her hunting skills as she was quick enough to dispatch an Alien where he was too sluggish. As he walks away, she confronts him. Scar growls and advances at her, trying to intimidate her, but he notices that she is not easily scared. So he may see that she has the right skills for a warrior, and grants her the opportunity to make it out there alive. At the end, he even feels she is deserving enough to give her a mark, making her a warrior of his people. The Predator elder recognizes this mark and acknowledges the respect they have for Lex, by granting her his weapon.",
            "Now alone, Lex is confronted by a Predator who is about to run his lance through her when he is attacked by an Alien. Lex picks up the Predator's lance and runs it through the Alien. Realizing that it's just her and the Predator against all the Aliens, she follows him into the nest of pods, where she finds Sebastian hanging. He warns her that they can't allow the Aliens to reach the surface and tells her to shoot him because there is one already inside of him. Meanwhile, the Predator sets his self-destruct bomb to blow up the chamber, and he and Lex escape together up the ice tunnel. The bomb goes off, destroying the pyramid. The Predator rewards Lex by etching the rite of passage marking on her cheek just as the Alien queen breaks through to the surface. As the Queen is about to stab the Predator with her sharp tail, Lex runs a spear through it. The Queen turns on Lex, chasing her around the whaling station until she takes cover under a water tower. The Queen tries to get at her, but the Predator leaps over and stabs the Queen with his lance. The Predator and Lex chain it to the water tower, but the Queen manages to spear its tail through the Predator. Lex works the tower free from its bolts, and it tumbles into the icy Antarctic waters, dragging the Queen with it. Lex then kneels beside the dying Predator as the entire Predator force uncloaks itself and its spaceship. One of the Predators notices the marks on her cheek and, as the others carry the dead Predator into their ship, he hands her one of their lances as a gesture of respect. The ship takes off, leaving Lex alone on the island. In the final scene, the dead Predator's body lies on a slab. Suddenly, his chest bursts open and an Alien/Predator hybrid emerges.",
            "When Lex and Scar reach the foot of the ice-tunnel, Lex looks up the tunnel and expresses puzzlement. The camera looks from her point of view and we see a faint silhouette moving and flickering in the light at the top of the tunnel; the Queen has already made her way to the surface. Scar and Lex are thrown a fair distance away from the mouth of the tunnel and always keep running on top of the ice as it collapses from beneath their feet. Obviously, the Queen was buried in the collapsing snow and ice, which is why she still emerges from the ice moments later.",
            "It is true that Aliens can sense an Alien embryo inside a person such as in Alien 3 when the Dog Alien wouldn't kill Ripley because she had an Alien Queen inside her. However, that was because the Dog Alien was a drone and had no reproductive capabilities. It needed to protect the Queen. In this film, it was the Queen who was the last one standing, so she risked killing one of her children by killing Scar in order to save herself. She is the Queen and can reproduce. If there's the choice between killing one of her children growing inside of a dangerous enemy and letting said enemy live long enough to kill her, so be it. Another point is that the Alien from Alien 3 took the time to \"sniff\" Ripley and know that the Queen was inside her. The Queen from AVP did not do this and simply attacked the Predator. Also, the Alien inside of Scar was of a different breed, so to speak. In Alien Resurrection, we could see the new type of Alien, born from a uterus opposed to being hatched from an egg, killing the Alien Queen and recognizing Ripley as his/her mother. As the original Xenomorph from Alien originated from crossbreed with humans, this could lead to the conclusion that Xenomorphs could sense if an impregnated creature carries the exact same species opposed to a new type of breed (or hybrid). By killing Scar, the Queen could be simply trying to uphold the purity of her very own species instead of letting a new type of Alien species come into play.",
            "Predators do not see finely-tuned infrared without their helmets, and possibly don't see infrared at all. At any rate, we don't know that they only see infrared naturally. The Predator's ability to see in finely-tuned (and trichromatic) infrared without his helmet, as seen in Predator 2, is a goof or an oversight (though there could be other explanations). However, a Predator can still see without his helmet, but the various elements in an environment are not so describable from one another, as evident in how it's shown as all one-colour (red) but various shades of that colour, hence monochromatic, as depicted in the original Predator. For example, the first Predator saw Dutch just fine and behaved accordingly. Even though the Predator in AVP couldn't see that well without his helmet, it would be hard to miss a gigantic Queen. Predators can see fine without their helmets-it may not look like much to us, but we're human and are only used to the way we process the visible spectrum. When the Predator takes off his mask, he presumably sees at least some of the visible spectrum, but in a simplified view. Aliens, humans, other Predators would all be the same colour so to speak. The use of finely-tuned infrared vision is just a visual aid to assist during a hunt.It's also worth nothing that a Predator's vision, helmet or no helmet, as presented in POV cinematography may not perfectly represent to the viewing audience how the Predator sees the world; since the audience, as human beings, can only ever perceive three primary colours at various levels of granularity regardless of what the colours, theirs shades and theirs blends are intended to represent as in the case of, say, topographical maps. The Predators' natural visions may or may not be monochromatic (despite the largely monochromatic cinematic presentation), and if they are such, the Predators' may possesses neurotechnology that enables them to perceive more than one, more than two or even more than three primary colours (like Geordi La Forge from the Star Trek: The Next Generation but without the necessity for it). Furthermore, it's possible that Predators are born with multichromatic vision but wind up with monochromatic vision as they grow and age, meaning that with adequate sensory enhancements, they could restore their more youthful abilities without rewiring their brains.",
            "The explosion of the Predator bomb could have raised the ambient temperature to a bearable level. The cold could have affected her, but while trying to run from the queen and just trying to survive in general, she would likely have had raised body heat and heart rate, so the cold would not have affected her right away. After the Predator ship took off we see her walking towards what appears to be the Snow tractor, so she might have made it, but whether she survives is ambiguous at best.",
            "A \"Predalien\", also known as a \"Hybrid\", an Alien that resembles a Predator. It has been established that Aliens take on certain characteristics of the host. This is demonstrated in Alien 3 when a chestburster that comes out of a dog (or in the Special Edition, an Ox) has dog/quadruped-like characteristics also minus the tubes on its back.",
            "They didn't bother to check. They knew he was dead, so they had no reason to believe he had a living Alien embryo inside. Also, the Predators weren't wearing masks, e.g., Scar had to alter his vision mode to see the embryo inside Sebastian. Or they simply forgot at first as they were busy executing their mourning rituals; before someone could think of checking for chestbursters, the hybrid Alien had already come out and matured. That said though, considering that the Predators are fully aware of the Xenomorph lifecylce and the danger they pose if control was lost, it would make sense that they would take every precaution possible, even if it involves examining a Predator who happened to die in some other way (like Scar). In the extended version of Alien 3 it is shown that the host does not necessarily need to be alive while the embryo is developing and ready to be born, so even though Scar was killed by the Queen, the embryo inside did not die with him and emerged from his body later on. The very fact that these trainees were sent into a place infested with them and would be dealing with them directly is reason enough to consider any possible way one of the creatures could slip past them regardless if any of them were to actually make it out alive.For intelligent beings that possess technology we have only ever dreamed of and go far beyond our current engineering capabilities (interstellar travel, active camo, energy weapons, etc.), it is rather ironic and somewhat humorous to see that they would fail to consider the logic behind such things under the given circumstances. For example, you don't have people studying or working with dangerous viruses (figuratively speaking here) who simply walk out of a room when they have finished whatever they were doing without first undergoing some kind of decontamination process, even if there was no \"accident\" and everyone seems fine. In a sense, the Xenomorphs can be viewed as the \"virus\" and the Predator's lack of a thorough post-examination on both dead and live subjects is just asking for trouble, especially if a live subject does not know or remember being impregnated. Scar for instance might not have been aware of what happened to him while he was marking himself, similar to how Kane in Alien had trouble recalling what happened when he was attacked. The important difference between the two here is that Scar knew the lifecycle and Kane did not. Scar's case is interesting because despite his aforementioned knowledge, suddenly getting knocked unconscious and waking up later on the floor, he doesn't seem to be able to connect the dots. After regaining consciousness he should have immediately (or at least at some point) become suspicious of the nature of the ambush and question why he had not been killed when he was clearly vulnerable. Also, had Scar known he was now a Xenomorph host, it is safe to assume that he would have not tried to escape the pyramid at all, it is more likely that he would have made use of his self-destruct device instead. In short, they (Scar included) should have checked, as it would have saved the Predators a hell of a lot of trouble in the long run.Then again, we don't know how Predators have obtained their current level of technology; they may have simply stole it from another nearby and more intelligent species, which they could conquer with their normal technology; or maybe there are intelligent Predator scientists, but the technology is primarily used by Warrior Predators, who lack the intelligence and discipline to use it ethically and safely. The fact that AVP: Requiem showed us a Predator seemingly specialized in \"cleaning up\" such mistakes created due to the sloppiness of others, may be an indication that such mishaps occur much more often. As far as the Sebastion thing goes, there seems to be a small amount of time in between when a person is captured and brought to the hive and when the egg actually opens up and the facehugger slowly begins to climb out (like Newt in Aliens), so Scar was probably scanning him to see if he had already been facehugged and impregnated or if he was still in the process of waiting for this all to happen.",

In Aliens, Bishop is an Android modeled after the founder of Weyland-Yutani (either CB Weyland, Michael Bishop, or both). In Alien 3, (as a subject of much debate) Bishop is either an advanced android with red blood which may have seemed too human so they were reverted back to white blood, or he is a direct descendant of Charles Bishop Weyland and is the heir and CEO of Weyland-Yutani in the 22nd century and designed the Bishop android modeled on himself and his descendants.",

            "It is not entirely explained in the movie, other than Jason Bourne stating to Marie that they probably got careless. It could mean that they were too exposed in their communications. We know from the previous movie that Marie was a drifter with many contacts and from the next movie that she has a brother. It is possible that her communications with friends or family were monitored by Treadstone, who learned where she was and naturally assumed Bourne was with her. We also see Bourne burning most of his documents, which may mean that Treadstone knew about some of their assumed identities and knew how to trace those to India. Abbott could then simply relay this information to Gretkov, who hired Kirill and send him there. Kirill later shows papers which identify him as a member of the Russian Secret Service (unless these are fake), so he may also have had access to databases and agencies that could help trace Bourne and Marie.",
            "Kirill didn't know that Jason and Marie had switched places in the car. He thought that Bourne was still driving, so that's where he aimed.",
            "Abbott's name was mentioned in the Neski file as a traitor, which is the reason why he had Bourne assassinate Neski seven years earlier. When the Neski file resurfaced and nearly came into Pamela Landy's possession, Abbott had to try and keep it out of her hands and keep her from digging into the Treadstone project. He tried to shift suspicion to Alexander Conklin (Chris Cooper) who was already dead and could not defend himself. Abbott set up Bourne as the one who had killed Landy's agents and stolen the file. Abbott also asked his partner Gretkov to hire an assassin to get rid of Bourne in India because, with Bourne out of the way, it would be a dead end for Landy's investigation. Bourne was the ideal scapegoat anyway, as he was the one who silenced Neski, so it made some sense that Bourne would try to finish his mission and get rid of Neski's surviving testimony. The big flaw in the plan was that Bourne was supposed to die in India, which did not happen. On the contrary, this only caused Bourne to become personally involved in the plot.",
            "After apologizing to Irena Neski (Oksana Akinshina) for killing her parents, Bourne returns to New York City and telephones Landy to ask why the CIA is still looking for him. She replies that she just wanted to apologize (off the record) and thank him for sending her the tape on which Abbott admitted his involvement in the theft of the $20 million. In return, she tells him that his real name is David Webb and that he was born on 15 April 1971 in Nixa, Missouri. She suggests that he come in so that they can talk about it, but Bourne looks out the window and replies 'Get some rest, Pam. You look tired,' startling her when she realizes that, once again, he's watching her. In the final scene, Bourne walks down the street and disappears into the bustling crowd."

            "Ken Watanabe is credited with playing R\u00e2's al Gh\u00fbl. However, Liam Neeson's character, Henri Ducard, is later revealed to be the real R\u00e2's. Some have speculated that because R\u00e2's al Gh\u00fbl is Arabic for \"The Demon's Head,\" this was simply a title transferred to Liam Neeson's character after the death of Ken Watanabe's character. But the script makes it quite clear that Neeson was R\u00e2's all along. During the reveal it states, \"Ducard (THE REAL RA'S AL GHUL) smiles acknowledgment.\" Therefore, Watanabe played a decoy, while Neeson played the real R\u00e2's al Gh\u00fbl. The credits read as they do so as not to spoil the surprise. According to comic-book sources, the real name of R\u00e2's al Gh\u00fbl is lost to history-remembered only by R\u00e2's himself.

Are his methods supernatural?\", to which Bruce Wayne replies, \"Or cheap parlor tricks to conceal your true identity, Ra's\", implying that the League of Shadows is always run by \"Ra's Al Ghul\" and Henri Ducard just assumed that role from the previous person. Another possibility is that \"Henri Ducard\" is just an alias and his true name is R\u00e2's al Gh\u00fbl and he was using a double to fool any outsiders until they are inducted into the League. The latter seems to be the case as he's only ever referred to as R\u00e2's al Gh\u00fbl in The Dark Knight Rises. However, in the Confidential Files found in the extra features of the Two-Disc DVD Deluxe Edition of the film, it is noted that he claims to have lived for over 600 years. This profile also notes that R\u00e2's has a daughter-Talia. R\u00e2's al Gh\u00fbl is approximately 450 years old (or more) according to comic-book sources: I appear to be a vigorous fifty. I am actually a very vigorous four hundred and forty-eight . . . or is it four hundred and fifty-three? I lost count during the Black Plague.

Proof that the cure wouldn't have worked is evident when she vaporizes the entire squad of troops that arrives after Magneto is cured. Phoenix easily stops the cure projectiles in mid-air and destroys them. Also, if Jean had lost her mutant powers instead of dying, she no doubt would have suffered psychological effects to her dual personalities. More importantly, Logan knows from their experience at Alkali Lake that Jean wants to die. She is equally confused, as are the other X-Men, when she miraculously survived the flood. She pleaded with Logan to kill her \"before she kills someone else.\" Wolverine simply put her out of her misery.",
            "Multiple Man (Eric Dane) does not die in the final battle. He doesn't even participate. He is captured by authorities in the Brotherhood camp in the woods. Magneto used him as a diversion to make it appear as if the mutants were still at the camp. In reality, Magneto and his band of mutants were long gone, heading for Alcatraz Island. Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones) is last seen chasing Kitty Pryde/Shadowcat through the Alcatraz facility when she rescues Leech. Kitty's ability to phase through matter gets her to Leech, but Juggernaut soon catches up. Juggernaut tries to kill both, but Leech's ability of nullifying mutant powers ultimately saves them from death. The impact against the wall renders Juggernaut unconscious. His fate is also unknown but, again, it is assumed he lives however, he could still be out cold if the authorities found him. He could then be put back into the same sort of custody he was in when Magneto freed him. Pyro (Aaron Stanford) is seen in the final battle facing off with Iceman. He seems to have the upper hand until Iceman (for the first time) turns his whole body into ice, then subsequently freezes Pyro's hands, disabling the devices that create fire. Iceman then headbutts Pyro, knocking him out. His fate is unknown but the novelization describes Drake carrying him to safety as the facility around them collapses.",

For you.\" At that moment, Jean's real persona takes over and, with tears in her eyes, asks Wolverine to save her. \"I love you,\" he says as he stabs her with his claws. Jean dies in his arms, and all the destruction ceases. The scene then changes, and the camera pans over Kitty Pryde/Shadowcat and Storm looking over the graves of Jean Grey, Scott Summers, and Charles Xavier, casualties of the Mutant War.

Also tears of joy that she gets to raise her daughter.Bill also says when he shoots her with the Truth Serum that there's a slight wave of Euphoria as an aftereffect. Once she has finally won a wave of Euphoria comes over her and she is uncontrollably laughing and also crying thankful for victory and the chance to raise her daughter. It was basically a bit of foreshadowing and also a double entendre. You don't really think much about the line when he says it, but it makes sense by then end of the movie.",
            "She was afraid of what Bill would do if she was honest about her pregnancy and desire to retire. From their lengthy conversation at the end of this movie, it's fair to deduce certain personality traits with Bill: He's unpredictable, disingenuous and ruthless. His general demeanor is frightening. Considering Beatrix Kiddo was his best assassin, it's fair to assume that he wouldn't have let her leave so easily without some sort of consequence.",
            "Budd tells Bill, \"If she wants to fight with me, all she's gotta do is come down to the club and start some shit, and we'll be in a fight.\" When Bill says, \"Unless you accept my assistance, I have no doubt she will succeed (in killing you).\" Budd later replies with \"That woman deserves her revenge. And we deserve to die. But, then again, so does she.\" It was a matter of karma and honor. They had all done horrible things to people and to each other, the Bride included. Budd obviously is not proud of his past, especially his part in what he did to the Bride. He refused Bill's help so it would be a fair fight; one on one. However, this doesn't mean he would simply drop to his knees and let the Bride kill him. His philosophy was \"If she kills me, so be it, but I won't go down without a fight.\" He also felt she deserved to suffer for what she did to Bill, but wasn't completely heartless in his act. He buries her alive, but instead of just doing that, he gives her a flashlight to be buried with. Knowing if anyone could possibly escape that scenario, it was her; giving her the flashlight was Budd's sign of respect.",

Rocksalt shells are hand-loaded with pieces of rock salt, replacing the standard lead or steel shot, which are designed to have more penetrating force making them lethal. Rock salt shells could be seen as the forerunners of modern less-lethal rounds. In the United States, rock salt shells were and are sometimes used by rural civilians to defend their property. The brittle salt was unlikely to cause serious injury at long ranges, but would cause painful stinging injuries and served as a warning. Some Spanish police forces, like the Guardia Civil and Cuerpo Nacional de Polic\u00eda, use special rock salt shells called SAL-90 in their riot control units.",
            "Likely for a few reasons. (1) Budd and Elle clearly don't like each other, for one reason or another. (2) Budd wanted 1 million dollars for the Bride's sword. (3) While Elle had the cash on hand, she likely didn't want to part with it for a sword, especially to Budd, as she says that the greatest warrior (the Bride) she had ever known met her demise at the hands of a drunken redneck like Budd, which infuriated her, because the Bride \"deserved better\". (4) Elle wanted Budd out of the way in order for her to stay closer to Bill. It seems Elle was very jealous of the Bride, as Bill fell for her. She was probably also jealous of Budd, as Bill clearly regretted the circumstances of their relationship, and Elle may have felt that he was taking Bill's attention away from her. So, by murdering Budd and framing the presumed-dead Bride for it, she would have Bill all to herself.",
            "There are many possible reasons. Elle could have called him on her cell phone, assuming she was not killed by the mamba. Bill was also expecting Elle within four hours. It's quite possible when she didn't show up he assumed The Bride had killed her. Esteban could have given Bill a heads up that he gave the Bride a map to Bill's home. Beatrix didn't kill Sophie Fatale so she went Bill and told him what happened. There may have been a surveillance camera or two set up near Bill's door; after all Bill, and BB especially, were in no way surprised to see her, even after not ever seeing her mother. So, Bill probably saw her coming down the hallway, told BB that she was coming, and instructed her on what to do. If it had been a surprise, any little kid who had always wanted to see his or her mom would likely run to her the moment he or she first saw her."

            "It is a common misconception that \"shorting stock\" means a short sale of shares. \"Shorting stock\" simply means to take a negative position on the stock price, which can be by selling shares \"short\" (intending to repay the shares later after the price falls), or as Le Chiffre did, by purchasing put options. Either can be called \"going short\" on a stock. A profit is realized if the price falls later on. If the price of the stock actually goes up, though, the investor loses money.A put option gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to sell a stock at a defined \"strike price\" to the party who sold the put options. By definition, the strike price is lower than the current price; the financial instrument would otherwise never be sold in the first place. The buyer initially pays the difference between the current market price and the strike price, plus a premium, hence Le Chiffre's need to get a new client and more funds: \"I have the money, so short another million shares.\" Le Chiffre expected to exercise his put options and regain what he paid for them, plus much more, once the hired henchman destroyed Skyfleet's prototype airliner. When he was told the \"ellipsis\" password expires in 36 hours, he remarked, \"That's all the time I have anyway.\" With Skyfleet's coincidental unveiling of a new airliner on the same day the options expired, Le Chiffre was cutting things very close.Since we only know Le Chiffre's final losses, there are infinite possible combinations of shares, strike prices and market prices. As an example, let's say that Obanno's money was $10 million out of the $101,206,000 lost. The next Q&A says that Obanno gave $100 million to Le Chiffre, but the actual amount is never mentioned, and clearly the $100 million loss is not just Obanno's money. 100 million dollars in 100$ bills weighs a metric ton, at 1 gram per bill.\nTwo men can carry 10 million dollars, not 100 million. We'll also say that Skyfleet stock's market price was precisely $30, and that Le Chiffre bought put options for a total of 10 million shares, at a strike price of $20 with a premium of $0.206 per share. (This is not an impossible share volume. DAL, for example, has over 845 million shares outstanding.) The less likely the seller thinks the strike price will be reached, the less of a premium will be asked. Indeed, Le Chiffre's own broker warned, \"Nobody expects this stock to go anywhere but up,\" so the premium on these puts would be very small. Le Chiffre would initially have to pay the difference between the market price and strike price, plus the premium: $102,206,000. As Skyfleet faced bankruptcy, Le Chiffre would buy 10 million shares on the open market, say $1 per share, then exercise his option to sell them at $20: a total of $190 million, less his $101,206,000 to buy the puts, for a net profit of $88,796,000. Quite a \"reasonable rate of return\" for a few days! If the market price had been $25, and the strike price $15, Le Chiffre would have netted $38,794,000. (To keep the scenario simple, we're using a price difference of $10 per share and 10 million shares.)But Le Chiffre's plan failed, and because Skyfleet stock's price continued to stay above the strike price, there was no point to Le Chiffre exercising the puts. In those final hours, no one would buy them for any amount, so they \"expired worthless,\" and Le Chiffre lost all the money he put into the puts (pun intended). It is very common for investors to purchase options that lose all value, and thus lose the money invested into them.Le Chiffre probably preferred put options to selling shares short because of the odds: options allowed him to set a maximum loss, in the unlikely yet not impossible event that his scheme failed. The irony is that despite his mathematical genius, he was a poor investor. A short sale would have been unlikely to lose so much money in the course of a few days. Once the markets opened, Le Chiffre could have started buying to cover, with every dollar increase in price being a loss of \"only\" $10 million. On the other hand, the put options were a necessary plot device so Le Chiffre could lose a great deal of money with no recourse. Now, had Le Chiffre tried selling shares short, he'd have still needed a massive amount of money to start. No brokerage house would let a client incur such a huge potential liability without collateral, in case the market moved against the client.It should be noted that Le Chiffre's broker was extremely incompetent. \"I'm sorry, I'm not sure yet how much you've lost.\" A professional wouldn't have been caught off guard by an important and prominent client. He would have carefully monitored such a large position and be able to report on a moment's notice, especially with the ease that computerized records, with the cost of all his transactions, can be summoned. Perhaps it was a plot device for Le Chiffre to demonstrate his mathematical genius, though it could have been written with the broker about to disclose the final losses, and Le Chiffre interrupting with the amount.",

In the film, he is working with Mr. White's organisation to profit from acts of terror. His main man is Alex Dimitrios; other henchmen are named Leo, Bobbie, Jochum, Kratt, and Valenka.

He targets individuals who he believes are wasting their lives and are in need of change. Even though Adam is portrayed as a struggling artist, Jigsaw sees him as a man who is wasting his life by focusing on material possessions rather than the things that truly matter in life.",
            "In the Saw franchise, Jigsaw, also known as John Kramer, is a complex and morally ambiguous character. He sees himself as a savior, trying to help his victims change their ways and appreciate the value of their own lives by putting them through his twisted tests and challenges. He believes that by forcing his victims to confront their own flaws and past mistakes, he is giving them a chance to change their ways and become better people.However, Jigsaw's methods are extreme, and he does not shy away from killing those who he sees as standing in the way of his goals or those who he sees as corrupt or wasting their lives. He believes that the ends justify the means, and that the death of some is necessary to save the lives of others.In the case of Detective Tapp, Jigsaw sees him as an obstacle in his mission, and as someone who is wasting his life chasing after him. Jigsaw views Tapp as a corrupted and obsessed man who would stop at nothing to catch him, even if it means endangering the lives of others. Jigsaw sees his death as a necessary sacrifice to protect himself and those he sees as worthy of living.It's worth noting that the Saw franchise is known for its graphic violence and morally complex characters, and Jigsaw's actions and motivations are not always easy to understand or justify.",
            "In the Saw franchise, Jigsaw, also known as John Kramer, is portrayed as a highly intelligent and resourceful individual who is able to design and construct elaborate and deadly traps. He is shown to have a wide range of knowledge and skills, including engineering, mechanics, and medicine, which he uses to create his traps.Jigsaw is also portrayed as a man who is driven by obsession and spends a lot of time and resources researching and experimenting to come up with new traps. In the films, it is shown that he has a workshop and a large collection of tools and materials that he uses to create his traps. He also has a team of apprentices who help him build and test the traps before using them on his victims.In addition, Jigsaw is also shown to be very creative and imaginative, he is able to come up with new and twisted challenges that test his victims in different ways. He also modifies some of his traps to fit the specific personalities and flaws of his victims, in order to make the game more challenging and to teach them the lessons he wants them to learn.",

What Lawrence doesn't know is that Alison has attacked Zep to save herself and Diana. Diana's screams were those of fear while she watched her mother struggle with Zep. Det. Tapp, who has been watching Gordon's apartment (believing him to have ties to the Jigsaw murders) breaks into the room and attempts to capture Zep. While Tapp holds Zep at bay, Alison and Diana escape to a neighbors apartment and call the police. Zep escapes, and Tapp chases him to an abandoned warehouse. While chasing Zep through the tunnels, Zep shoots Tapp in the chest, killing him, and then runs to bathroom to kill Lawrence. Thinking his family is being harmed, Dr. Gordon goes a little mad and finally picks up the hacksaw and saws off his foot. He then takes the revolver from the corpse and shoots Adam. Zep enters the bathroom, intending to kill Lawrence, but Adam is not fatally wounded and pounds Zep to death with a toilet tank cover. Lawrence then crawls out the door, promising to get help for Adam. Adam searches Zep's body for a key to his cuffs and finds yet another tape from the Jigsaw Killer revealing that Zep wasn't the killer, but was just another pawn in the game. His game was to kill Alison and Diana if Lawrence failed to kill Adam. If he did, he would get the antidote for the poison that Jigsaw had given him. Suddenly, the corpse in the middle of the floor gets up, pulls off a mask, and reveals himself to be Dr Gordon's patient, John Kramer, the real Jigsaw Killer. In a series of flashbacks, it is shown that John Kramer was being treated by Dr Gordon for terminal brain cancer. He tells Adam that the chain's key is in the bathtub, which was drained when Adam accidentally kicked the plug out. The key that would have freed him went down the drain and, having destroyed his own hacksaw, Adam has no way out of the chains. Adam grabs Zep's pistol and tries to shoot Jigsaw but is electrocuted by his hidden remote control before he can get a shot off. Jigsaw then turns off the lights and seals Adam inside the bathroom."

            "Laura ended up with the brick after double crossing everyone and stealing it. She stole the brick from the Pin's home before the sit down at his house, stashed it in her locker at school and returning to Tug's house, where she attended to Brendan prior to the meeting. From behind the scenes, she fueled the rivalry between The Pin and Tug's crew. She set them up to make the Pin believe that Tug only agreed to come to his house not to settle differences, but to steal the brick, thus leading them both into what Brendan describe as a slaughterhouse.At the end, Laura grades Brendan's tale, telling him \"That's most of it. Nine out of ten.\" In addition to the facts that Laura does tell Brendon, the less than perfect score refers to the that fact that his story is not complete. She indicates that Emily had been pregnant for 3 months with his baby.",
            "Although it does not say specifically, it is revealed that Brendan was indeed the father. This is revealed when Laura tells Brendan that Emily said she did not want to keep the baby because she did not love the father anymore. Laura says Emily came to her three months ago when she became pregnant. Three months ago was before she was with Dode or Tug, meaning that it was Brendan's baby all along.",
            "We are told that Tug killed Emily because he thought that he was the father of the baby she was having. It was Laura's idea that Emily tell Tug it was his baby to soften him up, but Laura was counting on Tug to kill or injure her. We find out that it was Tug who killed Emily after the scene with Dode, the Pin, Brendan and Tug at the tunnel. Dode tries to tell The Pin that he believed it was Brendan who killed Emily because he thought she was having Dode's baby. Tug kills Dode, thinking he is about to reveal the true identity of the murderer: himself.",
            "Kara is a manipulator, and as with her lap dogs, uses her looks to get over on people. In the case of the film's plot, she convinces Dode to sell his information to The Pin that Brendan is responsible for Emily's death (based solely on the fact he saw Brendan move the body). It isn't clear why Kara gets him to do this in the film, but in the original novella it seems to be strictly for the money, as after Dode dies she still tries to blackmail Brendan for it.",
            "As revealed at the end by Brain, Brad Brammish hired somebody to stab Brendan as revenge for beating him up in front of his friends. It was an ego/grudge thing, and not something that pertained to the rest of the plot; a red herring of sorts.",
            "It can be argued both ways. She clearly takes advantage of people, but there reason to believe that she did care about Brendon since she did tell him to stay away from the sit down since she knew it would likely turn ugly if it was discovered that she stole the brick, and she states that she does admire Brendan for what he is doing for Emily, as she does not know anyone who would do something like that for her. She has a dark side, but she also knows that he does too, which she makes clear at the end of the film. Both characters are smart and lonely, and perhaps these combination of qualities makes him attractive to her.On the other hand, she is manipulative to most characters in the film, including Brendan at times, and in the end, it is hard to know when she is being deceptive or not. She is very intelligent, but not trust worthy, even when she is telling the truth.The original script has a reference that may indicate that she may have had genuine feelings for him. Here's a passage from the original script...Laura: Don't go tonight.Brendan: I've got to make sure it plays out smooth.Laura: It'll play however it plays without you there.Brendan: I've got to make sure.Laura: Why?Brendan: 'Cause if there's war, I'm in it too.Laura: Well let's just, I mean why not just run away. Go somewhere. I've got a car.Brendan: *Gives Laura a wry look*Laura: I've got an aunt in New Orleans, she wouldn't care.Brendan: *Grins*Laura: Yeah, it's a stupid thing, but think about it, why not? What, school? C'mon. Family?Brendan: All right, stop.It could be read it as her just trying to get him out the way, but New Orleans? There might be something else to it.

There are two hints that he may have been undercover, however.1. Shortly before dying; Delahunt tells Billy that he gave him the wrong address, but Billy showed up at the right one, then rhetorically asked why he didn't tell anyone. This may have been because Delahunt knew or figured out that Billy was undercover, but as he was too, wasn't going to give him up. If he wasn't an undercover cop, it may be he decided to protect Billy as an act of penance. Given the rest of the gang brought Delahunt back to the bar to bleed out and die instead of getting him medical aid, he may have felt he didn't owe them anything and in fact, may have taken some satisfaction in knowing he would help bring them down by not exposing Billy.2. The local news states that Delahunt was an undercover cop, but Frank dismisses the report as misinformation to protect the real undercover officer.",

However, the first man who gets killed is Signor Pirelli (Sacha Baron Cohen) who pays Sweeney a visit to blackmail him. He recognized him \"from the old days\" and wanted half of his earnings. When Pirelli tells Sweeney this, he spontaneously smashes Pirelli's head with a teapot and later on slits his throat. The second attempt at killing is when Judge Turpin comes for a shave, but Sweeney fails because of the intrusion of Sweeney's friend Anthony (Jamie Campbell Bower). It's the moment when Sweeney's mind cracks, thinking that he will never have the opportunity to see the judge and his daughter Johanna again. His line between good and evil gets severely blurred. Sweeney realizes that everybody is bad and that everybody deserves to die: for the weak ones death will be a relief and for the strong ones a punishment, as stated in the song \"Epiphany\". It's the moment when he becomes a sociopath killer, being against everyone, even admitting that he, too, deserves to die.",

Sweeney is afraid Johanna might resemble Lucy too much or too less. He wants Johanna pale and with yellow hair like Lucy, but in the same time he thinks that, were she to resemble his old wife, she would remind him too much of the past. However, were she not to look like Lucy, he couldn't associate her image with the face of a beloved one, making her a stranger to him. Consequently, there is no good option for Sweeney, so he prefers keeping in his memory the old image of Johanna, unmodified, the way he knew her, not like a grown-up. That's why even though he loves her, he doesn't want to see her again and focuses on his priority (vengeance).",
            "Anthony arrives at the barber shop with Johanna, disguised as a sailor, and tells her to wait for him. Johanna hides when she hears the beggar woman approach the shop, searching for Beadle Bamford, Sweeney goes up into his shop and is surprised by the beggar woman, who seems to recognize him. Hearing Judge Turpin arriving and not wanting to miss his chance, Sweeney quickly slits the beggar woman's throat and drops her through the trapdoor. A few moments later the Judge enters looking for Johanna. Sweeney reassures him that Johanna is safe and offers him a shave before reuniting with her. Turpin agrees but, once he is seated, Sweeney reveals his true identity and brutally murders him, violently stabbing him in the neck repeatedly before finally slashing his throat. Sweeney then discovers Johanna hiding in the barbershop. Not recognizing her in men's clothing, he approaches to kill her but is interrupted by Mrs. Lovett's screams from the basement. He leaves Johanna unharmed, but warns her to forget his face and rushes down to the bakehouse. There, Mrs. Lovett explains that Turpin had briefly clutched onto her dress but then died after a few seconds. Sweeney orders Lovett to open the oven door. As she hesitantly does so, the fire illuminates the beggar woman's hair and face. Sweeney recognizes the corpse as his wife Lucy, whom he had believed long dead. Realizing that Lovett knew Lucy was alive but lied to him, Sweeney begins to waltz manically with Lovett around the bakehouse, reassuring her that he does not care about Lucy because the past is dead and that they can still be married. As he twirls her past the open oven, he suddenly hurls her into the blazing fire and locks her inside.

He kills Sweeney after which Anthony, Johanna, and the police run into the bakehouse.

They also needed a way to get the explosives on board so they killed Kyle's husband and, under the belief that airlines don't x-ray caskets, they bribed the morgue director to plant explosives under the lid of his casket which was being transported to the U.S. for burial. Because the casket was sealed with a security lock to which only Kyle had the combination, they kidnapped Julia and made Kyle look like a crazy lady so that, at some point, she would go back into the hold to open her husband's casket while searching for her daughter. They would then retrieve the detonator, plant the explosives, get Kyle arrested by the FBI, and blow up the airplane with Julia in it, so that there was no evidence that Julia ever was on the flight."

        "answers": [
            "The Comedian's assassin (Adrian) comes unarmed and kicks in the front door, rather than sneaking up quietly killing him. The reason Adrian decides instead to beat the Comedian half to death then toss him out the window is likely because Adrian hated the Comedian. In the one scene that shows any interaction between Adrian and the Comedian, the Comedian completely undermines Adrian's idea and is extremely rude to him. It can be assumed that there while the Watchmen were together the Comedian and Adrian had drastically different ideals and butted heads quite often. Also, it could be argued that Adrian wanted to give the Comedian (who was clearly the most violent and morally corrupt of the Watchmen) what he deserved. After he decided that the Comedian had to be killed in order for his plan to go smoothly, it was finally his chance to take on the Comedian in a man-to-man fight to the death. There's even a moment where Adrian has a hold of the Comedian's gun, but tosses it aside in favor of hand-to-hand combat. His face is not concealed to the Comedian when they fight (only to the audience) so it can be assumed that the Comedian knows who he is fighting-and that Adrian wanted him to know.Another question arises however, which involves Rorschach. When Adrian reveals his scheme at the end of the film, he says he had to kill the Comedian because he was working for the government and was onto Adrian's plan. He also says that the one snag in his idea was Rorschach's conspiracy that someone is taking out all of the Watchmen. When Dan says to Rorschach that it was a burglar who killed the Comedian, Rorschach does not believe that any ordinary burglar could have killed him. So Adrian, beating the Comedian and overpowering him, only fueled Rorschach's conspiracy. The answer could be that Adrian never could have predicted that Rorschach would develop such a conspiracy. When Dan comes to warn Adrian of Rorschach's suspicion, Adrian tells Dan that Rorschach is a sociopath and that one murder doesn't indicate a pattern. And while Dan becomes convinced, Rorschach is too stubborn to change his mind. Also, in by the end of the film, Rorschach's conspiracy does not foil Adrian's plot and only ends up being a minor inconvenience.",
            "After Ozymandias' betrayal is revealed, he states that, by killing millions, he has saved billions. Because both Moscow and various cities throughout the world were destroyed, the USSR and the USA join forces to track down and hunt the real and supposed perpetrator-Doctor Manhattan-as his energy was found at the sites of the explosions. The others agreed to keep this a secret so global peace would be maintained. However, Rorschach refused to compromise and left to tell the world what really happened. Doctor Manhattan then decided to kill Rorschach in order to keep the world at peace. The final scene shows the editor of \"The New Frontiersman\" (a far-right newspaper) annoyed at having nothing worthwhile to print, telling a young employee to find an article from \"The Crank File\", a collection of crank letters, among which is Rorschach's journal. It is left up to the viewer to decide what effect, if any, Rorschach's account of events will have on the world."

            "The identity of R.A.B. was a hotly-debated topic after the book came out and, of course, the truth is not revealed until the final book or, in this case, the final film.

R.A.B. is no exception, so close attention is paid, this film gives a clue that can be used to figure it out. However, if you just have to know now, R.A.B. is Regulus Arcturus Black, brother of Sirius Black. This revelation was actually guessed well in advance of the publication of the final book, largely on account of foreign language translations. Unlike the other surnames, which are largely made up by Rowling, the name and color Black exists in all languages. Readers noticed that, when \"R.A.B.\" was translated, the \"B\" was the only letter that changed, and it invariably corresponded to each language's word for \"black\"."

Essentially, when speaking to a superior officer, you are not allowed to say whatever you want unless given permission to do so.

To let everyone know he had regained the ability to speak.",

In Revenge of the Fallen, Barricade was never seen or mentioned in the movie but he does return in Dark of the Moon. Barricade returns again in The Last Knight.",
            "The writers have stated that the laser Ratchet fired at Bumblebee's throat halfway through the film took a while to take effect. Another theory is that Bumblebee's voice is fixed after he touches the AllSpark, when he goes to compact it into the smaller cube he gets a \"jolt\" or a \"shock\". This is the most logical explanation, as Frenzy's body (the small stereo robot) becomes fully regenerated when he comes into contact with the AllSpark, though he doesn't speak at all from this point until the very end of the film, just using his radio and beeps. In the sequel Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009), Bumblebee still appears to be unable to speak, although Sam Witwicky explains that he's just \"playing it off\".",

            "According to Robert Orci, Jazz was chosen to die because they couldn't kill Optimus or Bumblebee, and Jazz was the next Autobot most likely to be cared about by the audience. Also, with the exception of Bumblebee, Jazz was the only Autobot small enough to be ripped apart by Megatron. It wouldn't have been fair if only the Decepticons were the only ones getting killed, therefore at least one Autobot had to die and to show how threatening Megatron is.",
            "The reasoning behind Starscream being an F-22 probably has more to do with the nature of Starscream himself. In other iterations of the Transformer franchise, Starscream is depicted as a conniving, sneaky Decepticon who prefers well-planned sneak attacks rather than brute force, which fits the function of a stealthy plane like the F-22, which is designed to strike before the enemy even knows it is there. Throughout the movie, some of the Transformers display traits that are reflected in their alternate modes (i.e. Ratchet an Ambulance since he is a medic, Ironhide as a beefy truck since he is tough and armed), and considering Starscream's nature, the change in his alternate mode suits him. Also, the F-22 is a slightly larger plane, giving Starscream a bit more of a size advantage than he would have had with an F-15 alternate mode. The F-15 is an older plane, and the F-22 is now the top-of-the-line fighter, so it just makes more sense for Starscream to be a more modern jet."

            "It was the real Sutler. The \"doubles\" were not actually body doubles. They were simply impersonators Dietrich used on his comedy show. You can see the makeup lines around their necks to indicate they were wearing masks or in heavy makeup.",
            "He built it. Whether it was specifically for Evey or for anyone else he may have tried to convert, to show them what exactly he went through.",
            "Yes and no. The injections he was given at Larkhill have the result of increased \"kinesthesia\" among other things in him: improved reflexes, agility (motor skills), and a reduced sensitivity to pain.\nHowever, if you listen to the coroner's exact words, there is a suggestion of superpowers having developed: \"The mutations seem to have triggered the abnormal development of basic kinesthesia and reflexes.\" It's possible that The Wachowski brothers misunderstood, or decided to expand, the definition of kinesthesia, which is in fact that sense that allows us to determine the physical positions of our extremities in relation to ourselves. For example, it allows us to touch our nose with our eyes closed. In the case of V, we are perhaps expected to believe that he was able to comprehend his position, and the position of other objects, in the physical universe with greater speed and claity than an average human. This, combined with his increased strength, does suggest he was a form of superhero.In the graphic novel, no such mention of \"increased abilities\" is made, nor are we given any reason to believe that he acts with any abnormal capability. He is not presented as a \"superhero\" in the classic, \"spandex-clad-with-no-visible-means-of-support\" sense. In the source material, V is described as \"a psychopath... in its most precise sense.\" The experimentation at Larkhill had no physical effect on him, but rather altered his perception of the world and how he occupied it. It essentially removed the subconscious censor that we all have between thought and action. Our minds/bodies work on a sequence of perception-evaluation-planning-conscience-reaction (we see a threat, we take a moment to work out how dangerous it is, then how to counter it, then we have a moment's doubt, and then we defend/attack/flee/hide). V has lost the middle steps of the sequence and as a result, his body reacts instantly and instinctively, doing exactly what he needs to in order to counter any threat without conscience. To \"normal\" people, the ability to act without fear of the consequence may seem inhuman-but not superhuman.There are some elements that might be seen as supernatural, although the surface asserts a purely natural narrative; the inexplicable appearance in the swept and secure Victoria Station is one. Sending out hundreds of thousands of tight fitting costumes and tall boots, all of which appear to fit the wearers, might be another. Most of all, the image with the dominoes, intercut with Finch's psychic perception of the pattern, suggests at least a supernatural relationship to causality.",
            "This has not been revealed, but many believe ultimately it doesn't matter, believing that their purpose was never to kill/hurt people. Instead, they were to be a tool to scare/force people at the station to allow V access to the airways, and then later, to keep them busy while he made his escape. However, if they were real, Dascomb's ability to disarm them was due to either: (1) The bomb's set up wasn't so intricate that there was a right and wrong wire to be cut. If any part of the setup was disconnected, the whole thing wouldn't work. (2) He has prior experience in working with explosives, perhaps as part of military service or employment by the police. (3) He simply got lucky and guessed the correct wire. If they weren't real, then it didn't matter what he did, or did not do, as nothing would have happened either way.Common arguments for them being real: (1) Killing well-known news anchors, as well as destroying their main news studio, would have stirred up more emotion amongst the government and populace than the deaths of people they've never heard of, or buildings no one cares about. (2) V knows that as soon as possible after his message is broadcast, the BTN will surely play some sort of message against it, either the disheartening \"terrorist captured and killed\" response we saw, or something similar. By destroying the country's main news studio, as well as its top anchors immediately afterwards, it delays the time the BTN is able to broadcast a response, giving the populace who saw it more time to think it over and inevitably discuss it amongst themselves. The BTN's response will also be less believable due to the delay and in hearing it from lesser or completely unknown anchors. (3) Any single terrorist act, especially subsequent attacks (remember the first attack being the destruction of the Old Bailey) will always cause an erosion, at least temporarily, in popular support for a government.Common arguments for them not being real: (1) If they had gone off, V could have been close enough to have been killed/injured in the explosion. (2) An explosive of that size would not have been great enough to cause significant damage to the building and/or BTN's propaganda apparatus. Consider that even if the explosion had destroyed the studio and a good part of the surrounding floor, surely BTN has other studios available, at other locations, which could broadcast whatever they want in a matter of minutes. (3) V displays a tendency to not kill without specific reason. Therefore, it isn't likely that he would blow up a room full of civilians who hadn't harmed him personally. However, a good counterargument to this third point is that V's Domino Plan involves inspiring violent anarchy in the UK. This will result in civilian deaths/casualties as Norsefire will undoubtedly commit even further outrage-inspiring atrocities in an attempt to restore order. Also, V clearly does not have any problem killing Fingermen and police officers who work for the state. As such, office personnel at the BTN could easily be considered among those working for the state, and therefore part of the problem.",
            "No one knows as it is not stated in either the movie or the graphic novel. Furthermore, V says that he lost his memory while at Larkhill, so during the time frame of the movie's events, even he didn't know why he had been sent there. It's only stated that he was an \"undesirable\", which could mean that he was not heterosexual, a non-Christian (perhaps not the right denomination of Christian), that he had possessions that were deemed offensive, that he spoke out against the political regime, or that he was/did anything else the totalitarian government prohibited/feared. In an interview, Hugo Weaving did with IndieLondon, he offered the following:You understand that he's been tortured and physically abused and that's what has created him. But at the same time the reason he was imprisoned in the first place was, I would suggest, because he was some kind of political activist. And I think he was probably an actor so he has very strong opinions.The original graphic novel's Larkhill was based loosely off of Hitler's concentration camps and the Nazi atrocities, and it is left open whether V is a member of a racial minority, is homosexual, or that he was taken for his political views. However, it's possible that he was not being specifically punished, seeing as he was placed in a group that was almost certain to be unceremoniously disposed of. A man who can fashion explosives and destroy a detention facility in which he's being held captive is likely to make authoritarians nervous wherever he goes.Throughout the film, V exhibits an intricate knowledge of the workings of the Norsefire regime, and it's possible that he knew these things before being shipped off to Larkhill, thus it wouldn't be unreasonable to suspect that he was a some kind of strategic agent of the executive branch, perhaps the Sutler's administration or ones prior. He could have been a serviceman, a commissioned officer or a covert operative. This ties in with the symbolism of him impersonating William Rookwood, along with the symbolism in the unmasking of Dietrich's parody V revealing a parody duplicate of Dietrich's parody Sutler. And furthermore, the number five pops up in consideration of the concept of a fifth column emerging within Sutler's dictatorship. However, for this to work, it would mean that Sutler's loyal forces were unaware of the extent of the security clearance held by the man who would become V, for they surely would have killed him instead of imprisoning him, in order to maintain their party/state secrets. Nothing in the movie suggests that the transition from the previous administration to Sutler's was not smooth, but there is no telling how many state employees were sloppily fired and not murdered or executed.",
            "No, V is a master of disguise and he's able to disguise his voice as well. In some shots, the \"interrogator\" moves briefly into the light and you can actually see that it is Hugo Weaving. In the dialogue where he tells Evey that all the men want is one piece of information and subsequently that she is free, it is clearly Hugo Weaving. The graphic novel explains that V wore masks to look like different people in the shadows.",
            "In his conversation with Inspector Finch, William Rookwood spells out the plot hatched by the government to seize control of the country, and responds to Finch's suggestion that he be placed in protective custody by stating, \"If you want that recording, you'll do as I say.\" However, it is never made clear what recording is being referenced here. In the screenplay, there is an omitted piece of dialogue wherein Rookwood indicates that he recorded the conversation when Creedy came to him with the assignment of taking the virus to St. Mary's. This line was dropped from the finished film, but the subsequent mention of the recording inexplicably remained. Later events would have revealed that the recording did not exist, and was merely part of a ploy to get the police to place Creedy under surveillance, contributing to his worry that Sutler did not trust him and was spying on him.",
            "It is the Palace of Westminster, also known as the Houses of Parliament, on the bank of the River Thames in London. The structure serves a similar function as the United States Capitol building, which houses Congress, but in the film the Houses of Parliament are no longer being used since the British government no longer contains a legislature. The building's famous Clock Tower displays clock faces on all four sides and contains enormous bells which sound four times each hour (the moniker of \"Big Ben\" belongs to the largest of these bells, which weighs over fifteen tons).",
            "Just because somebody wears body armour doesn't mean that it can stop that many bullets. If a bullet is shot at that close range, such as we see in the film, it can probably pierce through, especially if it's already filled with holes from other bullets. Body armour also only tends to protect against penetration by diffusing the impact across a larger surface area. Getting shot with body armour is comparable to getting hit at the same speed with a baseball instead of a bullet, which can cause internal bruising and bleeding, and after enough hits, just the impact alone can be fatal. You also see him getting shot in the hands, arms, shoulders and back, any of which could also harm him, as these hits coupled with his extensive movement immediately afterwards as he fights would cause an extraordinary amount of blood loss. The armour visually quotes the angels' armour in \"Wings of Desire\"-cited in \"V4V from Script to Film\"-and symbolically, when he removes it, he puts off something transcendent, just after the Matrixy shivering of the background that intimates a shift of realities, descending to ordinary mortality. Hugo Weaving, in an interview, described V as \"a kind of angel\".",
            "After V refuses to remove his mask, Creedy orders his men to fire. After being shot repeatedly, and mortally wounded despite a metal plate in his vest to protect him, he massacres all of Creedy's men, including Creedy himself. He then removes the metal plate and stumbles out to Evey. The two share a tender moment and V tells Evey that it is up to her to decide if the train filled with bombs should blow up Parliament, as his exile has made him no longer part of the people. He dies in her arms. Evey places V's body inside the train and is interrupted by Finch. She refuses his orders to stand down, and convinces him of the country's need for hope. Finch lowers his gun, Evey pulls the switch and the train goes off. A mass of people approach in silence, orderly but not in marching order, outside in V's mask and cape, overtaking the guards. As the 1812 Overture plays in the background, Parliament blows up while fireworks burst into the air in the form of a \"V.\" (The \"metal plate\" is in fact the breast-plate of the armour from the full suit in V's hideout-the one he used for his sword fighting practice.)"

He leaps out the hospital window and, after being rammed by a few buses and cars, he flies towards the moon. Mary's heart starts beating again. A month passes. While eating ice cream with Mary and Aaron at an amusement park, Ray gets a call from Hancock. He tells Ray to look up. Ray looks up and sees a big Allheart logo on the moon."

            "It's likely that Beckett always planned on killing Governor Swann once he outlived his usefulness. However, when Mercer mentions that Swann was asking questions about the chest, Beckett felt Governor Swann was becoming a threat and used that as an excuse to get rid of him.",
            "One scene that was cut explained that if Calypso had greeted Davy Jones after his 10 years of ferrying dead souls, he would have been freed of his duty. This is in direct conflict with the repeated assertion that the Flying Dutchman must always have a captain, which is probably why the scene was scrapped, but the suggestion that \"real love\" can free the captain after 10 years remained in the film. It isn't out of the realm of possibilities that a new Captain, perhaps another crew member willing to take on the responsibility, could assume command until their 10 years are up, but nothing in the film suggests this. It was thus believed by many that Will would be freed after 10 years if his true love waits for him, so his wife and son waiting for him in the film's post-credit scene would mean that he is free to go. However, the opening scene of Dead Men Tell No Tales shows Will still being the captain of the Dutchman, 12 years after getting the post, confirming that the curse could not be lifted by \"real love\".",
            "Gigantism is a common symbol for greatness in mythology. Calypso's immense growth before exploding into crabs is a feature of her greatness as a sea goddess. You can't expect someone like Calypso to make anything but a grand exit.",
            "Calypso shouts an incantation which in the script reads: \"Malfaiteur en Tombeau, Crochir l'Esplanade, Dans l'Fond d'l'eau!\". This roughly means \"Across all the waters, find the path to he who wrongfully entombed me\", referring to Davy Jones after Will revealed that, while it was the first brethren court that bound her, it was Jones who showed them how it could be done.",
            "Calypso is a goddess associated with crabs and the sea (at least in the movie's mythology). It's a grand exit showing off her power, just like the crabs brought Jack and the Pearl to Tia Dalma on the shore in the Locker. A hint is given to this relationship when one of the crabs slips under Tia Dalma's gown and she is subsequently shown holding one, stroking it tenderly.",
            "Beckett is not a fearless leader. He is cold and calculating, but he doesn't make a move unless he's certain of the outcome. Every move Beckett made was the result of his being able to control or manipulate people. Once stripped of this power, he was not able to make a decision. It can also be assumed that he was paralyzed with fear and disbelief over what was happening, including the fact that the Black Pearl and the Flying Dutchman joined forces to destroy the HMS Endeavour.",
            "No. The reason Jones turned \"fishy\" along with his crew is that they no longer followed the Dutchman's true purpose which was to ferry the souls lost at sea to the afterlife. Davy Jones stopped doing that once Calypso failed to meet him after the 10 years. Jones then started taking those near death on as crew for the Dutchman, having them swear to serve for 100 years. However, in Dead Men Tell No Tales, Will appears aboard the Dutchman and he has a slightly barnacled appearance. Though nowhere near as extreme as Davy Jones and his crew.",
            "Bootstrap explains to Will in Dead Man's Chest that during your 100 years of service, you slowly start to lose your identity bit-by-bit until you wind up actually becoming part of the ship. So essentially, the longer you're aboard the ship, the more fish-like your appearance becomes and the more corrupted and under Davy Jones' control. Bootstrap was still himself by the end of Dead Man's Chest. However, by helping Will steal the key and escape the ship, Davy Jones locks him in the brig. This seems to rapidly accelerate Bootstrap's transformation into a slave to Davy Jones. Once Will takes over as the captain of the Dutchman, it essentially hits the \"reset button\" and the ship and crew revert to their original selves."

            "Short Answer: As Gerald Olin clearly and plainly puts it, it's an evil room.Longer Answer: As a result of the tragic and painful deaths taking place inside of it, the room has perhaps some form of metaphysical energy absorbed into it that has given it a form of sentience/consciousness and, like any living organism, it is driven by its most basest of needs: The Need to Feed. Only it doesn't eat physical forms, but the souls of troubled people staying inside of it, much like the Red Room in Haunting of Hill House or the Overlook Hotel in The Shining (for an official Stephen King reference). Of course, this is all speculation as no official description is given in the film other than Gerald Olin just saying that it's an evil *bleeping* room.",
            "If the scene had continued, he may have found himself back in 1408 (without Lily, because that would have just been another daydream like when he saw her after he thought he got out the first time).\nHowever, she probably wouldn't have reacted at all and Mike probably would have started freaking out realizing that he wasn't free if this was the case. Also if he WAS still in the room at the end, it would make the ending of the theatrical cut and the ending of the Director's cut pretty much redundant. He dies in the director's cut (sad ending) and he lives in the theatrical cut (happy ending). To have him still trapped in the room at the end of the theatrical cut would be just another sad ending, so then they might as well have left it as the director's cut.",
            "No, at the end of the film Mike is actually out of the room, free and clear. When going through his effects from the hotel he takes out his tape recorder, then fast forwards to point where he was holding his daughter. His wife Lily is in earshot of the recording and reacts to it. Then the film ends. Some people believe the scene shows that Mike is still trapped in the room, and perhaps Lily is now with him. This is not the case. The recording is what is called \"Electronic Voice Phenomena, or EVP.\" \"EVP\" is the recording of spirits from an electronic device: in this case, a tape recorder. The recording proves to Lily that Mike was telling the truth about everything. Another theory is that Mike is still alone in the room, Mike and his wife are now both in the room, or that Mike is dead and his wife is in the room. It's never made clear."

            "It is not stated - Madeleine White may be an attorney - but she functions as a \"fixer;\" someone who brokers exchanges of favors, political and otherwise. She likely employs people like private detectives to do things, or find things out for her. But from her brokering such things as Bin Laden's nephew's real estate purchase, as well as her relationship with the mayor, etc, she is very likely an attorney.It is more likely that she was joking about representing Bin Laden's nephew, since she tells Arthur Case that he is one of the references.And her role with brokering a real estate purchase of a nephew of Bin Laden's is as a fixer. The movie was filmed and set just less than four years after 9/11, so a relative of Osama bin Laden's purchasing property in New York City would probably face massive media attention and drawn the ire of the general public without someone like Ms. White to smooth things over. Even ten years after the movie came out, some people are still sour about this myth that Saudi Royals/Bin Laden family members were flown out of the country immediately after 9/11, so try to imagine how these people would have felt about members of the Bin Laden family buying property in New York around 2005/6. The nephew's reassurances about not having seen his uncle in nine years puts the timing a little close to when Osama started ramping up his anti-USA attacks, such as the bombing of the US embassy in Kenya. There's also the simple matter of guilt by association and such, since emotions and prejudice could easily take over in that situation, a situation that can be described as being like a former Wehrmacht officer trying to move to Israel in the 1950s or 60s.",

        ],
        "answers": [
            "The answer is mainly in the knife she was using. It's just a paring knife and neither very big nor very sharp. Also, Mercedes is very frightened and wants to get out of there as quickly and quietly as possible. As such, she simply tries to incapacitate him long enough for her to make her escape. Mercedes had earlier spoke of her shame and cowardice for not killing the Captain given her easy access to him, so she must be ambivalent. At the moment of her best chance to act, even saying to the Captain: You won't be the first pig I've gutted, she relents. She knows how to slaughter farm animals with a simple gash across the shallow main arteries and windpipe in the neck, so she must have decided that mutilating his face (after first slicing his back and stabbing his upper chest) would give her the escape.In the final test, Ofelia passes (sparing her infant brother though it costs her own mortal life), we learn a truly moral person must never shed innocent blood when ones own blood might do. We may see Mercedes' actions when she had a chance to kill Captain Vidal as perhaps more heroic, certainly more ambiguous and thus more grown-up than even Ofelia's sparing of her brother. Given that the Captain's actions throughout the film are far from innocent (apparently guided by cruelty, vanity, and a death wish to imitate his father's death in battle) Mercedes' decision to spare his life (for the moment) could be highest among the ethical highpoints of the film. (The doctor's actions, especially euthanizing the captured, tortured guerrilla, are also potent examples of right action.) Why Mercedes spared the Captain's life then may never be fully explicable. It is possible, Mercedes wanted to delay Vidal's death in order to let him see how his power deteriorates before his eyes; she would do this knowing the guerillas have invaded the storage barn and gotten a reinforcement of fifty men, at which point making Vidal's defeat certain. The act of killing may be something the Mercedes character associated with Vidal only, therefore killing anyone in her mind would make her feel similar and in line with Vidal. Also, the act of cutting Vidal's face creates a tangible, visual representation of his sadistic cruelty in an otherwise well kept and ordered military appearance. Bringing his \"ugliness\" into view, not unlike Wilde's 'Picture of Dorian Gray'. Also, the doctor says to Pedro earlier that if they were to replace Vidal, he would just be replaced by another Fascist so they would be wasting their time.",
            "It was simply part of the test. Ofelia needed to prove that she herself knew the correct door. There are also parallels here with the non-fantasy plot. In the conversation between the doctor and Vidal, the doctor talks about not blindly following orders, stating that only a person like Vidal is able to do that. In fact, it could be argued that all three tests are designed to prove Ofelia is the opposite of Vidal's character. It has also been suggested that, in many fairytales involving a choice among three things, two will be made of some attractive material, such as silk or metal, and one of a cheaper, less impressive material. The correct choice is the cheaper less impressive material. The three doors, from left to right, seem to be made of wood, some sort of metal, and another type of metal. Ofelia, like her fairytale predecessors, knew it was the cheaper material (wood), and thus chose it and not the metal door the fairies pointed out.",
            "Ofelia, under pressure, usually gives the 'right answer' to any dilemma in the story; and so, might have been expected to give her own blood (the mandrake subplot shows she has no fear of doing so), and pass the test that way. Having her 'killed' in the mortal world, simply makes it unnecessary to show her again eluding the other human characters."

Gambit (Taylor Kitsch) saves Wolverine from being hit by a falling piece of the Tower, then goes off to help the rest of the mutants escape the island while Wolverine attends to the mortally-wounded Kayla Silverfox. She tells Logan that she loves him, and he begins to carry her to safety. Suddenly, Stryker appars and fires adamantium bullets into Logan's brain (\"His brain will heal but his memories won't\"). Before she dies, Kayla uses her powers of persuation to order Stryker to \"walk until your feet bleed.\" The other mutants, led by Cyclops and Kayla's sister Emma Frost (Tahyna MacManus) escape the compound and are met by Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), who offers them refuge. With his memory gone, Wolverine is led away by Gambit but stops to gaze upon the dead Silverfox, whom he does not recognize. Stryker is then shown walking on tattered shoes and being picked up by military police for questioning about the death of General Munson. In the final scene, Deadpool's hand crawls out of the rubble and touches his severed head, his eyes suddenly snapping open.",
            "Yes. There is one scene during the credits and two separate scenes after the credits depending on which movie print you see in theatres. The scene during the credits has the military find Stryker and prepare to bring him in for questioning. The first scene after the credits has Logan drinking in a bar in Japan. The bar girl asks him where he comes from and he answers: \"I'm Canadian - I think\". She then asks him if he is drinking to forget and he answers: \"No, I'm drinking to remember\". The second scene after the credits shows Deadpool reaching for his severed head. The head's eyes open and with his sewn mouth reopened, he looks directly at the camera, and whispers \"shhhhh\" to the audience. The home video version features the Stryker scene, and features the Deadpool scene after the credits. However, the Japanese bar scene is available on the disc as a deleted scene.",
            "The scene where Stryker is seen to be walking after told to do so by Kayla, then being stopped in order to be brought in for questioning by the Military may be a set up for a possible sequel, or it might simply have meant to show how Stryker was saved from his fate of walking until he died. He is still head of an elite military unit in X2, so it's likely he managed to pass his interrogation.",
            "Yes, she died in the final minutes of the film, and is likely picked up by the approaching military ambulance that Gambit warns Logan about.",
            "Many fans of Deadpool have been complaining that the character was turned more into Baraka from the Mortal Kombat media franchise than the Wade Wilson/Deadpool so many had come to enjoy. His head is shaved, he is given a mixture of many mutant's powers, including an adamantium skeleton with a katana blade coming from each arm, Wolverine/Sabretooth's healing abilities, teleporting, optic blasts, etc. We know that in this film, he got the name Deadpool, because all the mutant's powers were pooled into one body. Many fans were upset by Deadpool's mouth being sealed up so he couldn't give any wise cracks as well, and being remote controlled by Stryker to attack Logan, making him little more than a robot.The reason Wade Wilson volunteered for the Weapon XI program is left a mystery in the film. This film basically sets up the likelihood of a Deadpool movie. Stryker orders the Weapon XI be activated prematurely, even though the other mutant abilities hadn't been completely installed, which suggests he will lose their powers and keep only the healing. His mouth was sealed to make him more of a drone, he was under Stryker's control so it wouldn't make sense for him to have his famous personality or talk at all. Logan decapitates Deadpool, but there is an extra scene at the end credits which shows Deadpool crawling towards his severed head and whispering \"shh\" to the audience. So we know he was not killed off. Given that Stryker activated him before the process was complete, and then abandoned him when it was assumed he was killed (also note that Deadpool being decapitated means he doesn't have an entire skeleton made of adamantium, therefore it is just in his forearms), Deadpool is now free and can go his own way, not to mention he'll probably be able to open his lips up easy enough, which he indeed does in the scene after the credits.In Deadpool (2016), which takes place in an apparent alternate reality (even within a softly-rebooted storyline) from X-Men Origins: Wolverine and in a contemporary world rather than the 20th century, Wade Wilson is duped somewhat like Wolverine, as he volunteers for a procedure (not necessarily part of the Weapons program) to rid him of his cancer. However, due to the alternate setting, the audience can have no certainty as to how or why the Wade Wilson of X-Men Origins became part of the Weapon XI program. It is very likely that Stryker still tricked him no matter the reason. The cancer angle is actually from the comics, a side effect of the gene therapy giving him the healing factor, it is also what causes his insanity and the scarring on his body.",
            "Sabretooth killed him. There is a deleted scene where Victor is seen standing over a wounded Dukes who is tied up in the boxing ring. More so, in the movie, when John Wraith is confronting Sabretooth, he says, \"I'm not scared of you. Your claws and long black coat don't work on me.\" To which Sabretooth replies, \"It worked for Dukes,\" implying that he killed him."

Apparently it had been dropped years earlier during World War II, but never went off and was never found and disarmed. Rambo, in an attempt to lead the Burmese soldiers away from Sarah and School Boy (Matthew Marsden), runs with a piece of Sarah's shirt tied to his boot to attract the soldiers' attack dogs by scent. Rambo finds the tallboy bomb and straps the claymore mine to it, then covers it with some leaves and wraps the tripwire for the claymore around the piece of fabric. The soldiers arrive and pull the cloth and tripwire, causing the claymore to explode, which acts as a detonator for the tallboy bomb.",
            "One possibility is that the weapon that School Boy carries makes a louder noise than a regular rifle or gun would make, especially in the location they are in. The purpose of the shot was to cause an echo that would throw the Burmese off, thus giving Rambo time to run to the old bomb that we see earlier in the film. More likely, Rambo removes a piece of Sarah's clothing in order to lure the advancing army to him instead of her using her scent (which the dogs were given in the compound). He then asks School Boy to fire a shot in an attempt to alert the enemy to his presence. Note that, as the rifle report reverberates, Tint and his men stop their vehicles and begin pursuit on foot. Rambo's Claymore gambit wouldn't have worked unless the Burmese army is on his heels - the shot tells them where to look.",
            "Just as the captured hostages are about to be executed, Rambo open fires with a machine gun, igniting a fierce battle between the mercenaries and Tint's army, with Tint's army having the advantage until the Karen rebels show up and join the fight. Sarah watches in horror as Rambo is shot in the shoulder by one of the soldiers on a gunboat coming down the river, but Rambo turns his machine gun on the boat until the guide blows it up with an RPG launcher. Realizing his defeat, Lt Aye (Aung Aay Noi) attempts to run away, but Rambo follows, stabbing him in the abdomen with his knife and ending the fight. As Rambo stands on top of the hill, looking down at the survivors, Sarah rushes around looking frantically for Michael, whom she finds tending to the wounded. Michael and Sarah wave to Rambo. He waves back and begins walking away. In the final scene, Rambo is still walking, but this time he is in Bowie, Arizona, and he's heading down the road to his family's ranch.",
            "It's difficult to say, there are reasons supporting both possibilities. Reasons why Rambo III isn't ignored are as follows: (1) There is a flashback to Rambo III which includes several lines of dialogue from Colonel Trautman, and (2) In Rambo III, Rambo gives the Afghani kid the necklace that Co Bao gave him in the second film. If Rambo ignored Rambo III, Rambo would still have the necklace. Reasons why Rambo III is ignored are as follows. (1) Rambo III ended in Afghanistan while Rambo: First Blood Part II ended in Thailand. Seeing how each film picks up where the previous one left off, if we were to include Rambo III, then Rambo somehow ended up back in Thailand with no explanation. (2) Rambo's world outlook at the beginning makes absolutely no sense if you include Rambo III. The third film ended on a positive note while the first two ended on a negative (thus the reason why Rambo was so cynical at the beginning of the second and third films). Therefore, if we are to include the third film, it would seem that Rambo wouldn't have such a negative opinion of mankind and the \"f-ck the world\" line would be very out of place, and (3) In the extended edition, there is a scene where Rambo has the same knife he had in the second film, why didn't he have this knife in the third film? After all he used a different knife when he went to rescue Trautman from Afghanistan. Either way it is really up to the viewer whether they decide to include Rambo III or not. Many viewers consider Rambo III to be the weakest entry due to it being way too similar to the second film although having a lot more of the cliched 1980s action movie one liners. If one doesn't like the third movie, then it certainly is possible to pretend that Rambo is the sequel to Rambo: First Blood Part II and is the third and concluding part of a trilogy."

            "Chances are he just stole the chopper that Bruce Wayne arrived in.Another possibility is that he simply left Bruce's penthouse after he couldn't find Harvey, an it's not like the party guests would have been able to capture him to later be arrested by cops.",
            "Judging from the film's opening sequence in which the robbers speculate about what the Joker looks like and the myth surrounding him, it's easy to presume that, at this point, very few people have actually seen him in the flesh. Therefore, it's possible that the robbers just thought their pick up was some crazy guy who was wearing make up as a joke which isn't beyond the realm of possibility. It's also possible they didn't get a good look at him. As soon as they pull up, he puts the mask on and gets in the truck.",
            "No. He's arrested by the SWAT team.",
            "Batman is well-known for being able to track people down and knowing Gotham like the back of his hand, as shown when he tracks down Harvey Dent and Thomas Schiff after interrogating Maroni. He knew that Dent was missing after preventing Coleman Reese's assassination and trying to track down The Joker through the day, and suspected that Dent took Gordon's family somewhere important, the most obvious being where Rachel was killed and he ended up being disfigured. He could've also used his Sonar to easily locate them.",

            "Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) didn't want Lau (Chin Han) to go to county because Lau, as a powerful businessman and the accountant of the mob, had valuable information that could help Gordon and Batman (Christian Bale) take down the mob and the Joker (Heath Ledger). If Lau were to be sent to county, he would be out of their reach and they would lose access to that information. Additionally, due to the corruption in Gotham, sending Lau to County increases the risk that the mob would either kill him or break him out.",
            "The Joker is used to stabbing people in whatever area he was aiming for. It's a dark shot, but it looked like he was aiming for the neck or mouth, which seem like common places for him to stick his knife.",
            "The main villain is The Joker and Harvey Dent also becomes a villain near 3/4 of the film as Two-Face. There are also other characters in smaller roles that can be counted as villains, i.e.,1. The Chechen (Ritchie Coster) (a crime lord who joins with the Joker),2. Lau (Chin Han) (a Chinese business accountant who keeps money for the mob).3. The Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy)4. Salvatore Maroni (Eric Roberts) (who now runs Falcone's mob family).5. Gambol (Michael Jai White) (a crime lord partnered with Maroni opposed to the mob hiring the Joker).",
            "No. There is a Barbara Gordon in Batman Begins and in The Dark Knight (played by Melinda McGraw), but this Barbara Gordon is the wife of James Gordon, Sr., not his daughter or niece. She is not playing the role of Batgirl. In The Dark Knight, when cops are visiting Jim Gordon's wife, Mrs. Gordon tells his son to go with his sister. In the course of the film, we see that Gordon has both a son and a daughter. It's possible that the daughter is the younger Barbara Gordon, who doesn't become Batgirl on screen.",
            "The crew and their roles are as follows: Happy (safe), Dopey (alarm), Grumpy (gathers the money in bags), Chuckles (crowd control), the Joker/Bozo (crowd control), and the driver of the school bus. In the film, the order in which they kill each other is:1. Happy shoots Dopey in the back with a suppressed pistol after Dopey disables the alarm.2. The bank manager shoots Chuckles in the back with a shotgun.3. Grumpy shoots Happy in the head once Happy opens the vault.4. The bus driver runs over Grumpy.5. As the bus driver wonders what happened to the other guys, the Joker guns him down with an automatic pistol.The first two went as planned, but assuming the bank manager didn't shoot Chuckles and the bus driver didn't run over Grumpy, it's likely that Chuckles would have killed Grumpy (as Grumpy already shot Happy). Then the bus driver would have killed Chuckles and in the end, the Joker would have still killed the bus driver. However, the Joker is a highly intelligent psychopath, so he is able to plan everything out meticulously. Therefore, the events in the actual robbery may have worked out exactly how he had planned: knowing that the bank was a mob bank, he knew that the manager likely would have had a weapon stashed in his office, so he had Chuckles stand guard with his back to the office so the manager would shoot him. Then he had Grumpy place the money in an area too close to the doorway so the bus would run him over.",
            "Yes. The Joker is using a customized Glock 17 which is a 9mm handgun with an extended (31 rounds with standard floorplate, 33 with extended, the normal for this magazine is extended) magazine, since the weapon is converted into firing full-auto. He uses this handgun in several scenes; it appears to be his gun of choice. The Joker wields this handgun in the bank heist, on the semi trailer in the convoy chase, at the money burning pile, and in the hospital (it is attached with a silencer in this scene). The gun the Joker uses in the convoy chase scene, when he gets out of the truck yelling \"Hit me!\", is a Smith & Wesson M76 submachine gun with a swivel stock that is folded to one side. Source.",
            "There is only one real Batman. The other ones are a gang of vigilantes who are inspired by Batman, which is why they wear goalie pads and use guns instead of gadgets. When the Joker is trying to draw Batman out, he starts killing these would-be followers of the Dark Knight. These impostor \"Batmen\" were likely inspired by the \"Sons of the Batman\" a violent vigilante gang featured in Frank Miller's graphic novel, The Dark Knight Returns that formed from a larger gang called The Mutants that splintered after Batman defeated their leader in hand-to-hand combat. A similar group called the \"Batboys\" appears in Miller's sequel, The Dark Knight Strikes Again.",
            "The pencil penetrated through one of the thug's eyes (although this is not explicitly shown), as the vulnerable eye is the only possible \"point of entry\" for the pencil to make an instant kill. Death would result from either the force of the eyeball, the pencil, or both breaking the bone directly behind the eye socket and forcing it into the brain; alternatively, the pencil itself could have penetrated straight through to the brain. Then again, for moviegoers who can't suspend their disbelief, the pencil itself could have been one of the Joker's deadly props. The Joker, throughout the character's history, has always had a supply of normally harmless items turned deadly, such as playing cards that are razor-sharp and flowers that squirt acid. The present Joker proves to have the same fondness for malicious gadgets right from the beginning, when he sticks a gas grenade in the bank manager's mouth. This seems especially plausible given that an ordinary pencil could not be jammed into a table, as the Joker does, without the pencil breaking and thus no longer able to stand up for the Joker's \"trick\".",
            "The secret garage is not connected to the penthouse. Instead it's located underneath a shipping dock owned by Wayne Enterprises. Even though it's not a canon part of the Nolanverse, Louise Simonson's novelization of the animated Batman: Gotham Knight provides a reasonable explanation of how Bruce was able to modify his penthouse apartment in The Dark Knight (boldface added for emphasis): Despite a recent effort by an ex-CEO to take the company public while Bruce was out of the country and presumed missing, Bruce had managed to buy up the majority of the stock. He continued to own the controlling shares in Wayne Enterprises, which had given him a great deal of leeway when it came to remodeling the corporate headquarters.The Wayne Enterprises building took up an entire city block. It rose in art-deco splendor into the skies of Gotham, just as splendid, in its way, as the taller Aparo Tower. It was one of Gotham's indespensable hubs of financial power and a vital center for public transportation. Half of its first floor and basement level was a nexus for subway, monorail, and commuter train lines.The building had been badly damaged during the violence that followed the recent outbreak at Arkham. Wayne had used the excuse of much-needed repairs to install a private elevator that ran from his office, through the basement, and into the subbasement level that housed the newly refurbished Applied Sciences Division.Where does the richest man in Gotham move when his house burns down? For Bruce Wayne, the answer was easy - find the priciest luxury tower in town and buy the entire top two floors.With seven bedrooms, six baths, marble flown in from Italian rockyards, two ballrooms, and panoramic city views, Wayne's new residence represents the ultimate in city living.Wayne Industries is using the apartment to test out radical new technologies for home use. It's a \"digital home\" where your every whim - from music to lighting to video and games -- can be granted via fingertip access points.Wayne gutted the interior and invested millions in a renovation. And today was the move-in date.Curiosity seekers and photographers jostled for a view as Bruce Wayne moved his belongings - thinned out from the fire -- into the penthouse suite at Gotham Century Towers.",
            "Two of Gambol's men place the Joker's body on the pool table. The other three were escorting the men who supposedly \"killed\" the Joker. When the Joker jumps up from the table, we see him reach out with both arms, obviously killing the two men who put him on the table by stabbing them. This then raises the question as to how he stabbed both of them and managed to get a perfectly clean knife up to Gambol's mouth. But let's not forget that the Joker carries multiple knives at all times and that he is very fast, as he managed to get the upper hand on Batman twice in the film.",
            "The Joker explains that he will let one of the three remaining thugs from Gambol's gang join his gang. \"So,\" he explains, \"we're going to have ... try-outs.\" He breaks the pool cue in half, looks at the now sharp end of one half, and drops it between the three men. \"Make it fast,\" he says, as he leaves the room. Gambol's men are shoved to the ground, and as they recover, they all look at the broken cue, then at each other. He who is the first to grab the pool cue and kill the other two gets to work for the Joker. While later scenes give no additional insight into what happens offscreen, it's generally accepted that the term \"try-outs\" when used in most contexts (e.g. baseball tryouts, etc.) refers to testing the abilities of an individual as relates to the goal they are seeking (or in this case, having forced upon them).",
            "The Joker has his blade in Gambol's mouth, threatening to cut his cheeks. And presumably he does, off camera. There is a belief among some fans that you can't die from having your cheek slashed, but it is possible; laceration of the face was listed as a cause of death in the infamous Black Dahlia murder. The shock and blood loss could cause death. It's also possible that the Joker got carried away and went beyond cutting Gambol's cheeks. Since the murder happened off camera, we don't know.On the other hand some suggested that Gambol did not die at all. Since the action is off screen, Gambol might be playing dead to hide from the Joker's and the thugs' attention after being cut at the mouth/cheek.",
            "Batman uses some sort of hydraulic hand device to snap the gun. If you listen, you can hear a mechanical noise as Batman bends the barrel of the gun. He also uses this same device on Scarecrow's van. He tries to rip a hole in the side in an attempt to apprehend the villain. After the device jams, Batman is slammed into a wall and Scarecrow almost escapes. Batman then jumps onto his van from a few stories up, and crushes it. He captures and ties up the Scarecrow, his henchmen, and the fake Batmen. This is the only time we see this device used, as he gets a new suit shortly after.",
            "Batman is able to deploy his cape partially, just enough to slow the fall and prevent serious injury. Because he is holding Rachel, he breaks her fall, too.",
            "Since the room isn't soundproof, the Joker could have simply lured someone to him by making a ruckus (like trying to break the glass, for example) and start talking to whomever is on the other side of the window. Not to mention, with shards of broken glass everywhere, there was a much higher risk of him possibly harming himself, which the Joker clearly isn't afraid to do, given the smile on his face. All he needed was his phone call. Which was his legal right. So even if he didn't demand the phone call by force, they likely would have given it to him eventually.",
            "It isn't a knife. It was a piece of glass from the two-way mirror that broke when Batman slammed the Joker's head into it. This can clearly be seen in either the IMAX theater or the Blu-ray disc. It's far too large to be concealed in a shoe, and it has an extremely reflective surface facing out.",
            "No. Out of Gordon's unit, he was the only one Gordon truly trusted. Stephens was the one who checked the vitals on Gordon after he was shot by the Joker. Therefore, he knew Gordon wasn't dead. If he were corrupt, he likely would have told Maroni that Gordon's death was faked. Gordon also trusted Stephens to guard the Joker in the interrogation room. But Stephens let his temper get the better of him, and the Joker was able to take him hostage to escape.",
            "It's possible that the bombs were remotely activated only after Batman and the cops were seen rushing out of the Major Crimes Unit. Hence, the Joker's claims about having \"only minutes left\" may have been instructions to his men to detonate both bombs if they didn't see Batman or the police rapidly leaving the building by a certain time. Also, they may have been told to detonate the bomb for whichever building the police arrived at, before they entered. The timers on the bombs may have just been a fail-safe, had Batman tried to locate and neutralize any spotters, he wouldn't have had time to rescue whichever target he went after.It's also possible that the Joker didn't truly know that it wasn't possible for the police to rescue the other hostage, but was simply intending to make Batman have to choose to only rescue one of them personally. Given the abilities of Batman's vehicles, it wouldn't be unreasonable for him to assume that Batman would make better time than the police, and thus waited to reveal his hand until after it was likely that no police cars could make either location in sufficient time.",
            "Not exactly. While the film tries to keep the characters relatively realistic, it still requires us to suspend our disbelief. The left side of Dent's face is soaked in diesel fuel, which is ignited, completely burning and charring the skin on the left side of his face. His left eyelid is completely burned away as well as most of his cheek, exposing his jaw muscles and the inside of his mouth. This is the unrealistic part: burns that deep would need more prolonged exposure to heat than what would be provided by a thin layer of accelerant on the skin, especially given the fact that Batman was present to pat out the flames. While there are no vital arteries to be destroyed, he would be in an unimaginable amount of pain. Given the pain, grief and trauma Harvey suffers, it's not difficult to imagine him going insane. Harvey's internal battle, as depicted in the comic books, is the battle between his evil, revenge-driven half and his sane, compassionate half, hence his new name, Two-Face.While a person could reasonably survive the burning, it is worth noting that it is not possible to leave the muscles and eyeballs exposed without the tissue becoming highly infected and necrotic (dying). Immediate surgery and skin would have been required. Harvey also makes facial expressions that are not possible, since his muscles are so badly damaged. It's also not possible for him to speak as clearly as he does, since half his lips and cheek are missing. Moreover, third degree burn victims are also highly susceptible to infection. They are kept in \"burn units\" in hospitals where the air they're surrounded with can be controlled. Nevertheless, it's not difficult to suspend our disbelief for the character, especially when he exists in a comic book fantasy. Many viewers put down his survival and ability to function to an adrenaline rush. It's also worth noting that the character does not live for very long after the accident, so his ability to survive in the long term need never be a problem in terms of realism. Dent even says \"You think I want to escape from this?\" then gestures to his burnt face and says \"There is no escape from *this*!\". So it seems that Dent knew he was a dead man by leaving the hospital and simply wanted vengeance before his passing.",
            "The Joker has himself arrested so as to get to Lau and discover the location of the money. After doing so, he has all the money and is therefore in a strong position to demand his fee.",
            "Mainly, because the The Joker is a liar and a psychopath. The Joker has a twisted set of principles. He will twist his words so people will believe him, but the result will not favor anyone but him. He deceives the mob because he is disgusted by how they only care about money and not the chaos and anarchy he loves so dearly. For example, he finds the money as he promised the mob he would. Then he sets fire to \"his half.\" However, given the fact that all the money is piled together, the rest of it would burn as well. He told Batman where both Rachel and Harvey were being held hostage as he said he would, but he switched the addresses. He tells Dent that the kidnapping was \"nothing personal\" and we later find out that it was the Joker's intention to lead Dent specifically to insanity.",
            "Bruce Wayne indicates to Lucius Fox that he has budgeted a large amount of money to a government telecommunications project. When Lucius asks, Bruce indicates that he is \"playing this one pretty close to his chest.\" The audience can only assume that this was all part of a plan that Bruce had, knowing the technology would come in handy against the Joker. (Later in the film, it becomes clear why Bruce did not tell Lucius, who is upset by Batman's spying.) It is not known exactly how Batman equipped every cell phone in Gotham with sonar technology. It is simply presented as possible, in order to advance the plot. In order to assimilate or approximate a three-dimensional space, sound waves must come in consistent stereo pairs; cell phones have a single speaker for resonating sound and a single microphone for receiving sound. Further, in order to process sound differently than they are equipped, the cell phones would need to have both their hardware and software upgraded. It is highly improbable that Bruce, even with a government telecommunications project, would be able to forcibly upgrade the cell phones of every resident in Gotham simultaneously without a single person noticing. Therefore, we can assume that it was a gradual process that Wayne started as soon as he realized the implications of the sonar technology. He could have simply provided the upgraded phones to Gotham citizens purchasing new phones. After all, Americans/Westerners usually upgrade their cellphones every two years. Over a period of months or even weeks, a significant number of Gotham citizens would have them. If the cell phone was a significant technological advance, people would have been lining up to buy new ones regardless of the age of their current phone. Just look what happened when the iPhone was made available.Another strong possibility is that the project had nothing to do with new phones, merely new phone software. As anyone who buys a cell-phone knows, you can easily download software applications to your phone; the phone company that carries your service also can download software to your phone, and in fact does so when initializing a phone for activation. Wayne's project may have been software that was distributed to cell phone users across Gotham, and designed so that it would not be known to the phone users that new software had been installed. This explanation makes sense in context: Lucius states that Wayne has \"converted\" every phone in the city, not replaced the phones with new ones. And Batman relies on the Joker using a cell phone that would send a signal-which would only make sense if Batman had distributed software to every known number in the city, and not had to rely on the Joker buying a new phone.",
            "In the first fight, in Bruce Wayne's penthouse, Batman was fighting multiple opponents at once. The Joker stood back and observed the best time and position from which to attack. Still, he didn't exactly get the upper hand on Batman. In the final fight at the end of the movie, the Joker sends Rottweilers to attack Batman. While Batman is trying to fend off the dogs, the Joker starts frantically beating him with a pipe. This causes Batman's sonar to malfunction, leaving him blinded and open to attack.",
            "Ra's al Ghul was responsible for being on the monorail and he also is the one who destroyed the controls in the belief that Batman was trying to stop the train, when in fact, destroying the controls actually aided Batman in his plan. Batman threw the Joker off of the building himself. In the first case, Ra's put himself in the situation which resulted in his death, whereas in the second case, had Batman not saved the Joker, he would be solely responsible for murdering him. Doing so would have been a violation of his one rule, \"I will not be an executioner.\" It is also possible that Batman was trying to prove to the Joker that he was incorruptible. The Joker even makes it a point after Batman saves him to say \"You truly are incorruptible.\"",
            "A number of reasons:1. When Dent had Gordon's family at the place where Rachel died, the police had a border already set up. By this time, Joker was in custody. Had they blamed Joker, everyone would have known they were lying. That would prompt an investigation into the other deaths. Batman and Gordon wanted to preserve Dent's image as the \"White Knight,\" giving the citizens of Gotham hope.2. Batman wouldn't want to falsely pin crimes on even someone like the Joker.3. After the events of The Dark Knight, Batman can no longer allow himself to be affiliated with Gotham Police without risking more deaths. By \"rebranding\" himself, he not only severs all ties to authority, he is also \"becoming the villain.\" As Dent is allowed to die a hero, Batman must accept the opposite responsibility. (i.e. Dent's phrase, \"You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.\")4. Harvey Dent is a leading prosecutor. If word was to get out that he's a crazy killer, all the crime bosses in prison would have sufficient grounds for appeal. All the convictions of all the cases Dent has ever tried could be overturned, and all the crime bosses would be back on the street. The movie mentions this a few times. In their first meeting, the mayor cautioned Dent that he had better watch himself, because all they need is a little dirt on him and all the cases would crumble. During the scene where Dent threatens the fake honor guard who was actually a paranoid schizophrenic, Batman warns Dent that killing him would put all the cases in jeopardy. Batman reiterates this to Gordon at the end.5. During their final confrontation, the Joker explains that Batman's weakness is his adherence to rules. Why abide by a code when your enemies obviously don't? Pinning Two-Face's crimes on Batman is sending a message to the public, and it's not a terribly positive one. This also plays into his psychological dilemma evidenced by the line \"I've seen what I have to become to stop men like him.\" (Another possible interpretation in this vein is referenced earlier in the film. The point is made that the criminals are not scared of Batman because they know he won't kill, making him less effective. By pinning Two-Faces crimes on Batman, it changes that perception, striking even more fear into the criminal mind.)6. Giving Batman a villainous public image should prevent any further copycat batmen harming themselves and others.7. Since he began his fight on crime, Batman has, inadvertently, become the glue that holds Gotham together. Alfred tells Bruce after the Joker shows up that he can't quit, and that he would have Bruce endure because he can make the choices no one else can make. The decision to take the fall for Harvey was the only way to keep the crime bosses/criminals from being released from jail and to keep the city inspired. The personification of Batman is the only image/symbol strong enough for Gordon to use, which could convince the people of Gotham to believe the story that Batman, not Harvey, was responsible for those deaths. It would not have been very convincing or ethical to blame those crimes on another person/criminal. This was Bruce/Batman's way to be whatever Gotham needed him to be.",
            "Harvey Dent's role in the film is to be presented as \"the perfect guy\" (or rather, \"Gotham's White Knight\"). He is an honest person bent on fighting corruption to make a better future for everyone, and was trusted by Batman, the Mayor, and Gordon, as well as earning some affection from Rachel. This \"perfect\" person is used by the Joker to make a point to Gotham. With all of the people's spirit based on Harvey as their saviour from the climate of fear created by the Mob, his corruption would make \"their spirit break completely\", which is the Joker's prime intention. He knew that Batman would go after Rachel when given the choice, so switches the addresses, and Harvey is pulled out of a building alive, with the one he loves dying instead. The Joker then visits him in the hospital to shift the blame off himself, and leaves Dent to descend into insanity, killing cops and, later, innocent people. As is seen throughout the film (those most explicitly in the ferry scene), the Joker wants to turn good people into bad people, to make \"fair\" chaos. By taking \"the best of us\" and \"tearing him down\", the Joker can show that everyone can be corrupted. The Joker saves his final act for Batman. Although it can be said he didn't break his one rule with Harvey Dent, it is quite obvious that he pushed both him and Gordon's son off the edge of a building, saving only the son. Everyone is eventually corrupted by the Joker.",
            "He survives. He's the first hostage Batman tackles when he flies into the construction building. Batman tells Engel to stay down and Engel nods. That is the last we see of him. The SWAT team goes inside to take out all the clowns, but they were actually hostages dressed up as the Joker's men. Batman stops the SWAT team from killing any of them.",
            "He was tied up on top of the money pile that the Joker slid down. He is never seen being taken down before the Joker lights the pile on fire. We can assume he was burned up with the money. The scene finishes before the fire reached Lau, so no screams or man-on-fire is shown, probably in an attempt to keep the film's rating at PG-13.",
            "There is no definitive answer. Some say Batman broke his code; others say he did not. The answers hinge on interpretation of intent and outcome. Some argue that even if Batman accidentally kills one of his foes, it is still a violation of the code, while others argue that an accidental killing does not count.One interpretation: Batman did break his one rule in order to save Gordon's son, which is what the Joker prophesied earlier in the film by saying, \"Tonight you're going to break your one rule.\" However, the Joker's initial plan was to get Batman to kill the Joker himself; showing that everyone is corruptible. Batman beat him and showed that the Joker couldn't force him to break his rule. Later, Batman chooses to break his rule by killing Two-Face. The moral is that Batman won't be forced into doing anything by a maniac. He chooses to do the right thing even though people might hate him for it.2nd interpretation: Batman pushed Two-Face away to save Gordon's son, but Two-Face wouldn't let the boy go. Batman's choice was to save Gordon's son and let Two-Face fall or vice-versa. Batman chose to let Two-Face fall; but he didn't kill him.3rd interpretation: No, Batman did not violate his code. At the end of Batman Begins, his final words to Ra's al Ghul were, \"I won't kill you, but I don't have to save you.\" When faced with the choice of saving the innocent or bringing the guilty to justice, Batman will always choose the former. Had he stopped the train, the water under Wayne Enterprises would have been vaporized as well, with catastrophic results. With regards to the next question, there were still innocent lives at stake when he chose not to save Ra's. In the Joker's case, there was no imminent collateral damage for Batman to consider. Therefore, he could safely apprehend Joker without causing innocent people to be harmed, which was the completely opposite course of events the Joker had intended.4th interpretation: Batman killed Two-Face by accident. He did not mean to actually kill Two-Face when he tackled him, but merely meant to overpower him and lost control in the scuffle. Seeing as how an innocent life was at stake, Batman simply acted on reflex to protect the innocent (Gordon's son) and miscalculated the amount of strength necessary to take on Two-Face, leading to his death.",
            "Rachel wrote to Bruce, telling him that she has chosen Harvey Dent over him. Alfred destroyed the letter to stop Bruce from getting his heart broken. This is an important point in the film: the truth hurts. Gotham's spirit depends on the lie that Batman had killed the people that were really victims of Two-Face, and Bruce's ability to cope with the situation depends on the hope that Rachel would wait for him. Sustaining the lie was the key to being able to stay strong after the events of The Dark Knight. Though destroying this letter does have consequences in the following film, The Dark Knight Rises."

            "Though what Daniel says is inaudible, it leaves Eli visibly shaken. At one point during the film's final moments however, as Daniel storms upon Eli before bludgeoning him with a bowling pin, he exclaims emphatically, \"I told you I would eat you.\" At no point in the film do we hear Daniel say this to Eli, so this reference is most likely what Daniel says given the context of the moment, and the information we have as the audience.",
            "Yes.",
            "It's rather obvious that Daniel (Daniel Day-Lewis) and Eli have been feuding ever since Daniel snubbed Eli publicly at the dedication of the Little Boston well. Coupled with the money that Daniel never paid Eli, $5,000 of an agreed-upon $10,000 total and that Eli was really a fake in his faith-healing-Daniel roars at him about not being able to restore H.W.'s hearing-and that Eli's motivation in having Daniel be baptized was to humiliate him publicly, so Daniel cracks in the last scene and kills Eli.Additionally, the fact that H.W. Plainview (Russell Harvard) was now going to be a rival to Daniel caused more fury and anger in him, which Daniel projected onto Eli. When Eli visited and told Daniel about Mr. Bandy's land, Daniel had already drained the areas with the wells he'd drilled surrounding that area. Daniel wanted nothing to do with Eli. He killed Eli out of hate. The last line \"I'm finished!\" meant he was finished with his guest along with his life. It could also mean that Daniel had eliminated his last possible source of competition, Eli.Another explanation lies in Daniel's view of family. He accepted H.W. as his son, as he had control over the child. As H.W. became autonomous, he withdrew from Daniel, destroying Daniel's attempt at family. Eli arrives, telling that he and Daniel are now brothers-H.W. had married Eli's younger sister. As Daniel never sought this creation of family with Eli, he decided to destroy it. A popular explanation of Daniel's killing of Eli and the meaning of the film's final line is that throughout the movie, Daniel devolves into a purely evil human being. From the beginning where he is so poor that he is willing to crawl on his back for miles to claim a silver find to the end where he has become rich and is now almost completely insane, Daniel has descended into becoming truly demonic. Ultimately, he is so evil that the murder of Eli means absolutely nothing to him, and his final line, \"I'm finished,\" cements the fact that he has \"finished\" his descent into evil. Another interpretation to the final line could be that Daniel meant that he was finished \"eating\". This could either mean finished eating the meal that can be seen when the two were talking, just before the murder or that he was done \"eating\" Eli as Daniel can be heard saying \"I told you I would eat you up.\" while he chases Eli around the bowling lane.It also can be said that Daniel took Eli as a competitor who was making money without any hard work by using Daniel's money. Daniel states that he has a competition in him and he does not want anyone to succeed. By killing Eli, he took revenge of his humiliation and also removed a person who was succeeding.",
            "H.W. is the son of one of Plainview's men in the early part of the film. The infant boy's father is killed in accident (the film's first death), and he is \"adopted\" (taken) by Daniel. We are forced to speculate on Plainview's motivations for taking and keeping H.W., though he clearly does not want the fact he is not the boy's biological father to be made public (this would be why he avoids discussion of the boy's mother). Toward the end of the film, Daniel throws it in H.W.'s face that he adopted him in order to have a cute \"sweet face\" when purchasing land-if he presents H.W. at meetings with communities (like the one early in the film) or at private meetings with individual land owners, it will make him seem more human and less like the conniving, greedy man he really is. In that opening monologue with the large group of people from the surrounding community, Daniel states very clearly that he's \"a family man\", which would be a great detail to convince others that he's somehow an honest dealer. Regardless of this attack, which Daniel concludes by repetition of the term \"bastard in a basket\", it is clarified in an immediate scene that Daniel loved the boy as a son, noted by his reflection on one of their past playful interactions. Daniel holds both qualities as a user and a loving father in his relationship with H.W. and he is hurt by the son's choice to leave him and start a competitive company at another location."

In tough case, close calls, like at the gas station, the coin is a way of letting nature have the tie-breaking vote, when he honestly feels stuck on the horns of a dilemma. That determinism dovetails with why he is neither surprised nor self-pitying when he gets his arm broken after getting T-boned, despite having the green light. He accepts -- nay, almost predicts -- random, bad outcomes like that. And just marches on and makes the best of it. If he had any code of conduct, it was odd.",

            "Possibly. But Chigurh's a hunter. His job is to track people down. He found Llewelyn's truck at the massacre, that was enough to track down where Llewelyn lived. So Chigurh likely would have found him eventually. It just would have taken longer.",
            "When Llewelyn goes back to the site of the shootout to give the wounded Mexican water only to find he's dead. It's clear the Mexican was shot in the head due to the blood splatter on the back window. It's possible the Mexican shot himself to put himself out of his misery if he had a sidearm. But given the driver's side window was shot out too, it's likely the men that chased after Llewelyn had executed the wounded Mexican.",
            "There are a variety of reasons for which Chigurh could have killed The Managerials. Initially it might have appeared as if Chigurh killed them in order to double-cross his employer. It is likely that this was what The Man Who Hired Wells (Stephen Root) thought was happening, causing him to declare that Chigurh had gone rogue and to hire Wells to clean up. Events later on in the movie all but discount this as a possibility, especially at such an early stage. Chigurh apparently takes his job very seriously and it may be that he felt they did not share that same level of professionalism. Later on we discover that Chigurh doesn't like to work with others at all when he says to The Accountant, \"You pick the one right tool.\" This makes it seem that this was the main reason he killed the Managerials. He had been hired to do a job and did not expect anybody else to be given the same job. Another motive of Chigurh may have been his desire to swap out his car for their truck. The \"Mind ridin' bitch?\" comment and their general attitude also did not improve their chances of staying on Chigurh's good side but since Chigurh is a professional killer, it probably didn't faze him very much to begin with and he was planning to kill them regardless of what they said to him. It's also possible that Chigurh relies on anonymity. He is hired through a contact and does not meet his clients. If a client sends people to meet him and see his face, he feels he must kill them to maintain his anonymity.",
            "The three Mexicans at the Del Rio motel may have been hired by The Man Who Hires Wells (as well as Chigurh). Another possibility is that they are from the drug side of the deal-gone-bad. The Man Who Hires Wells mentions that the other side is \"out their product\", implying that the drugs were also reported as taken by a third party (whether they actually were or not is unknown, though the truck bed is empty when Bell arrives at the deal scene). Because of this it is possible that the three Mexicans are from the drug side of the deal and The Man Who Hired Wells gave them a transponder to assuage their employer, the drug side, who was apparently unhappy with the way the deal went down. They used this transponder to find Llewelyn Moss' (Josh Brolin) motel room and incorrectly assumed that the satchel was somewhere inside the room, when in fact it was a few yards away in the ventilation duct between rooms. It is not known for certain which party the Mexicans represent, only that they were given a transponder at some point by The Man Who Hired Wells. This is explained in the conversation between Chigurh and the Accountant (Trent Moore). The Accountant does not explain the Mexicans' affiliation, only that The Man Who Hired Wells felt that the money would be found faster with more people looking for it. This makes it likely that he hired them to find the money, but that is not necessarily the case. The Mexicans incorrectly assumed the money was in the room. When Chigurh bursts into the room after punching out the lock (finding the room with his own transponder) the Mexicans, probably after searching the room and not finding the satchel, were waiting to ambush Moss when he entered the room. Unfortunately for them, it was not Moss who entered, it was Chigurh who murders all of them assuming they had already found the satchel. He searches the room and checks the one place they did not, the air duct. He finds the marks the the satchel made when Moss pushed it through, and eventually took it out the other end and escaped. Later on, after the final unseen shootout at the end of the film, this is how Chigurh knows the satchel would be in the airduct and takes it after the police finally leave the scene of the crime. Several clues support the inference that Chigurh must have gotten the money: (1) you know he was there after the cops left, because the lock as punched out, his MO, and after calling him a ghost, the sheriff imagines him behind the door, only to open it and have him vanish; (2) you know he opened the air-duct gate, because a dime was left next to it, his same MO at the Regal Motel; (3) when he pulled the $100 bill out to buy the kid's shirt after the car crash, he copied Moss's behavior, when he had the money, by suddenly pulling big bills of his pants like nothing to buy clothes.",
            "Carson Wells was hired by the man who also apparently hired Chigurh to kill Llewlynn Moss and retrieve the money, as Chigurh had been hired to do originally. The Man Who Hired Wells declares that Chigurh has gone rogue, which means he either thought Chigurh had or was in the process of double crossing him or that he simply did not approve of Chigurh's methods. He hires Wells to clean up the situation. Wells' exact profession is unknown. He claims he is merely a \"day trader,\" implying that he may moonlight as a hitman/bounty hunter/mercenary or just do it in his free time, whereas it seems to be Chigurh's full time profession. However, this may have just been self-deprecation in order to humble himself to Chigurh in the hopes that he might be spared. We cannot know his actual profession for sure, but it is safe to assume that he was contracted in a way similar to Chigurh and so both probably have the same occupation. Late in the film, he is referred to as a retired colonel. The movie does indicate that Wells is highly intelligent, observant and alert, however, this is not enough to save him from Chigurh. Wells also seems to be cocky and overconfident, and Chigurh is able to get the drop on him.",
            "Chigurh killed The Man Who Hired Wells because he had tasked people other than Chigurh with finding the money. Chigurh saw these people as an unnecessary inconvenience and so he eliminated them as they were encountered, starting with the managerials out in the desert at night. The last straw for Chigurh is when he finds that Wells has been hired to kill him. Interestingly, after killing The Man Who Hired Wells, Chigurh only mentions that a transponder was given to the Mexicans from Moss' first motel room and nothing about the fact that somebody had been hired to kill him. When the accountant explains why the Mexicans also received a transponder, Chigurh says, \"That's foolish. You pick the one right tool,\" implying that The Man Who Hired Wells had brought this on himself by tasking others with finding the money, instead of relying on Chigurh alone. Despite his reasons given, it is likely that the main reason that Chigurh decided to kill The Man Who Hired Wells had to do with the fact that he hired Wells . Chigurh, while psychotic, has principles. Out of all the possible reasons as to why Chigurh killed the two managerials in the desert, if it was simply because he found them to be an inconvenience and not because he was double crossing his employer, The Man Who Hires Wells may not have been killed by Chigurh. That is to say that if the Man Who Hired Wells didn't take the killing of two of his men as a double cross and, in turn, did not give the Mexicans a receiver or hire Wells, and instead let Chigurh finish his job, it is possible Chigurh would have completed his task and given back the money to his respective employer. Unfortunately, The Man Who Hires Wells thought Chigurh had gone rogue and sealed his fate after hiring Wells and helping the Mexicans.",
            "It is left ambiguous as to whether or not Chigurh killed The Accountant. When the accountant asks if Chigurh is going to shoot him, Chigurh replies by saying, \"That depends. Do you see me?\" This implies that if The Accountant plays blind, Chigurh will not kill him. The script has the accountant answering Chigurh's question with a, \"No,\" (the scene then changed) which would imply that he lives. The question could have also been rhetorical, being that he obviously *does* see him, meaning yes, he will kill him.",
            "Llewelyn Moss goes to the motel and waits to be reunited with Carla Jean and Agnes (her mother). While waiting, the poolside woman (Ana Reeder) flirts with him and offers him beers. What happens next can be seen as ambiguous, the first option is that the Mexicans knew where he was headed because Agnes had told them at the bus station. During the ensuing shootout, the poolside woman was killed and her body was found in the pool. Moss was able to shoot one of the Mexicans before he was shot in the chest and died inside his motel room. The remaining Mexicans ran off as Sheriff Bell pulled into the parking lot. The second option is that Bell actually comes across a shoot out between the Mexicans and Chigurh who has already killed Moss and the poolside woman. The evidence for this is circumstancial at best, The Mexicans are using machine guns which we hear, one of the Mexicans has been shot (by either Llewelyn or Chigurh) but we don't hear this. The machine gun casings are a considerable distance from the shot Mexican, why would the Mexicans be shooting towards their own man? There are no bullet holes observed in Llewelyns room or in the wall surrounding the door.",
            "Agnes (Beth Grant) died of her cancer. It is implied that Chigurh killed Carla Jean. After she refuses to call the coin toss, Chigurh is seen leaving her house and checking his boots, presumably to make sure he doesn't have any blood on them. In an earlier scene, Chigurh, after shooting Carson Wells, sees the blood coming down the floor and puts his feet on the bed, to avoid getting blood on his boots. (In the book, she does eventually call the coin toss and when it is incorrect, he shoots her.) When he kills all the Mexicans in the hotel room, he does so wearing white socks, which he the takes off and leaves behind. Also, when the Mexicans drive away following the death of Llewelyn, we hear a sound very similar to the sound we hear when Chigurh exits Carla Jean's house: the sound of the bikes the two boys are riding. The Coens could have used this sound as a director's trick to make us believe she met the same fate as Llewelyn.",
            "After meeting with Carla Jean, Chigurh got in a serious car accident, with a compound fracture of his forearm. A couple of teenagers (Josh Blaylock and Caleb Landry Jones) on bikes approach him, asking if he's okay (he clearly isn't, having several cuts on him and an injured eye). He pays one of the kids for his shirt so he can make a sling for his arm, gets to his feet and flees the scene of the accident. Whether he died or not is up for the viewer's interpretation. With an injury like that, he would likely have died without medical attention. That being said, he is seen to tend to his own gunshot wound earlier in the film, but the idea of him setting his own broken bone is unlikely (you need someone else to apply lateral force to get the bones to re-align). The book also leaves this to interpretation. It may be possible he has access to a \"back alley\" doctor or at least knows where to find one. Chigurh believes in the random nature of fate, and that is what happens to him at the end. The killing of Carla Jean is unnecessary if he has the money. It only keeps the promise he made to the now-dead Moss. So, the car running into him is \"instant karma' for his lack of \"principle\".",
            "Although it is left open for interpretation, it is implied that Anton Chigurh wound up with the money. After the police activity died down, Chigurh sneaked into Moss' room and unscrewed the vent to retrieve the satchel of money. He knew this is where the money would be because he saw the track marks inside the vent of the Del Rio motel room, and knew that Moss kept it in the vent. When Sheriff Bell arrives at the El Paso motel, he sees that the vent was unscrewed by a coin, which Chigurh used in the previous motel. However, a shot of the vent in the El Paso motel shows that the vent may be too small to have accommodated the case containing the money. But, after Chigurh is involved in the car accident at the end, he offers the bicycle boys a hundred dollar bill, which implies that he did wind up with the money. In the book, Chigurh found the money and returned it to a third party. Like Wells said, he did have his principles!"

            "Miraz (Sergio Castellitto) was already Regent with the powers of the King, if not the title. He could have killed Caspian (Ben Barnes), but up until that point it was believed that either he or his wife was unable to have children, which is not good for anyone in a royal court and especially not a King. In the book where Miraz is already King, there is an exchange between Prince Caspian and Dr. Cornelius: \"But why now?\", said Caspian, \"I mean, why didn't he (kill me a) long time ago if he wanted to? And what harm would I have done him?\" Dr Cornelius' reply: Listen. As long as he had no children of his own, he was willing enough that you should be King when he died. He may not have cared much about you, but he would rather you should have the throne than a stranger. Now that he has a son of his own he will want his own son to be the next King. You are in the way. He'll clear you out of the way.",
            "After the Narnian's steal weapons from the Telmarine's camp in the middle of the night, Miraz approaches General Glozelle (Pierfrancesco Favino) and asks him how many men were lost. Glozelle initially replies that the Narnians came like \"ghosts in the night,\" that they did not even see them, and that no one had been killed. Miraz however presses Glozelle harder for an answer, emphasising that it was a \"bloody\" attack, and slaps Glozelle across the face. Glozelle turns round to look at the men behind him before replying to Miraz that the answer was three. The implication of this scene is that even though the Narnian raid on the campsite had been entirely bloodless, Miraz needed casualties to justify a war against the Narnians. Thus, when Glozelle replied that no one had been killed, Miraz effectively suggests that Glozelle should go and kill three of his own men in order that they could then later blame it on the Narnians and start a war.",
            "There are no hints of any Caspian/Susan romance in the books. It was something added for the movie. In the book, Susan and Lucy don't even meet Caspian until the very last chapter (Chapter 15) and, even then, they have barely any form of interaction whatsoever.",
            "For the most part, the night raid is an entirely new sequence, created especially for the movie, to act as the main action set-piece for the second act of the movie (in the same way as the \"frozen waterfall\" sequence was added to the first movie). Director Andrew Adamson felt that the concept of mythological creatures attacking a medieval castle was quite an interesting visual and one that had never been seen before. However, in many respects, this scene does have some grounding in the book. In chapter 7, during the \"dancing lawn\" scene, Reepicheep and his mice \"said that councils and feasts could both wait, and proposed storming Miraz in his own castle that very night\". Later in the same chapter, after the Narnians have arrived at Aslan's How, Lewis comments that \"there was fighting on most days and sometimes by night as well; but Caspian's party on the whole had the worst of it\". Therefore, it could be argued that some of these battles did take place at night and that the night raid sequence is a logical expansion of a preexisting plot point, albeit one that Lewis skims over in his narration. The only change is that the Pevensies are present, which stems from the result of the decision to have the Pevensies meet up with Caspian much earlier in the story than they do in the book.",
            "Between the events of The Lion The Witch and the Wardrobe and Prince Caspian, one thousand and three hundred (1,300) years have passed in Narnia. Mr. Tumnus, and every other Narnian character from The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe (except for Aslan and the River God) has long since died.",
            "Aslan (voice of Liam Neeson) is the only character to appear in all seven books. Although his role varies in size, it's always crucial to the book in question. In Prince Caspian, however, his role is downplayed a bit from Lewis' story. In the book, Aslan is the one who leads the children and Trumpkin (Peter Dinklage) to the How. At first, he's only seen by Lucy. By the end of the journey, all five can see him. Also, Aslan makes a greater journey at the end of the book than seen in the film, riding across the lands, bringing them to life, and showing himself to others. This journey, as well as leading the Pevensies and Trumpkin to the How, were either changed, cut out, or shortened for the film.",
            "It is not a direct allegory of a story like The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was, but it takes a few cues from the Bible and contains Christian themes. For example, some aspects of Prince Caspian are similar to the story of King David, a rightful ruler being hunted down by those in power who are trying to kill him. It also has the common biblical theme of having faith in God even when He doesn't seem to be around anymore. C.S. Lewis said himself that the books were intended to echo stories from the Bible; however, they're enjoyable books in their own right; you don't need to be a Christian to enjoy or understand them.",
            "No. In Narnia, Jesus is represented by Aslan, and God is represented by the \"Emperor over the sea.\" The river god in Prince Caspian is merely the spirit of the river. \"God\" is used in a mythological sense, not in a religious sense. He is the ruler of that river and the naiads that live in it, but he is not God."

            "3 possibilities:1.) The Predalien retained a little of the Predators' fanatical devotion to honor.2.) It's also possible the Predalien was just being cautious, the Predator had survived quite a bit of damage by this point and it'd never seen a mask removal before.3.) It's been suggested that the Predalien retained some predator psychological traits. If you look closely when Wolf is examining the crashed ship, you can see the skinned bodies of the crew hanging in the background.",
            "He was using Dallas (Steven Pasquale) as a bait to lure the aliens in. He didn't come to the earth to kill humans; ironically he was actually there to protect them in a way. He killed the cop because he spotted him, he killed the stoners because they were going to shoot him, and he shot the guy in the graveyard because he had a revolver and was making threatening gestures (In the Unrated Cut). Other than that, he doesn't bother harming humans, though he was the means of Jesse's unintentional demise. As for Dale's death, he saw that he was going to be killed by the alien anyway, so he was dead no matter what.",
            "When informed by Colonel Stevens (Robert Joy) that there will be an airlift arriving at Gilliam Circle in 20 minutes, Kelly (Reiko Aylesworth) points out that the army's first measure is containment, not evacuation, and that their plan probably is to use the townspeople as bait to draw the aliens to the middle of the town where the Army will then be able to destroy everyone with a bomb. Sheriff Morales (John Ortiz) doesn't agree and joins some other people headed for the Circle. Kelly, her daughter Molly (Ariel Gade), Dallas, Ricky, and Jesse decide to head for the hospital, planning to use the Medevac helicopter to get out of the city. Unfortunately, the hospital has become a battleground between the aliens, the Predalien, and the Wolf Predator. Jesse is impaled by the Predator's flying daggers, and Ricky is wounded when he attempts to attack the Predator. Dallas picks up the Predator's pulse rifle, and they head up to the roof only to find more aliens blocking their way to the helicopter. While the others cover her, Kelly makes her way to the helicopter and gets it started. While the Predator kills off the remaining aliens, the others make it to the helicopter and successfully take off. Meanwhile in Gilliam Circle, while Morales waits for evacuation, the military drops a bomb that destroys the town and the remaining aliens. The shock wave forces Kelly to make a crash landing in a clearing where they are surrounded by Guardsmen who disarm them and provide medical care to Ricky. In the final scene, the Predator's rifle is presented to Ms Yutani (Fran\u00e7oise Yip).",
            "As it had been decided to nuke the town to stop the infestation it would stand to reason that the military would position soldiers around the perimeter to make sure there weren't any surviving creatures at the outer limits of the blast radius. They also surely knew of the helicopter's departure using satellite imagery or RADAR and when it crashed went to look for survivors.",
            "Keep in mind, this is a science-fiction monster movie, so it requires some suspension of disbelief. Colonel Stevens was working for Mrs. Yutani, so he might have been a corrupt officer in the military and was actually following orders from Ms. Yutani as opposed to the Government. Therefore, he had no Government authorization to drop the nuke. It would probably be blamed on the nuclear power plant in the city having a meltdown. While power plant meltdowns don't cause nuclear explosions, we know that Weyland-Yutani loves a good cover-up.",
            "The infamous \"Company\" referred to throughout the previous Alien movies is called Weyland-Yutani. We can assume from what we see of her that she is the CEO, or some other high up person, of this company. Her presence represents the foreshadowing of the future control, involvement, and power her company will have in the Alien/Predator universe. The first AVP movie included Charles Bishop Weyland, the CEO of the then Weyland company. They most likely merged in later years, finalizing the merger in 2030 [Predator: Concrete Jungle (2005) (2005)].",
            "In the backstories, Predator blood is said to have a basic (counter-acidic) composition, though it is likely meant that the blood is simply non-caustic (since bases can burn just like acids do). This goes for the Predator movies as well, as there are plenty of examples of Predator blood spilling on surfaces without any corrosion occurring. In the film, the Predalien showed no signs of acid blood. When the Predalien fought the Predator, it looked like a lot of blood poured out, but it did not affect the Wolf Predator. Either the Predalien did not have acid blood or the blood did not pour on Wolf Predator-unlikely, given how much sprayed around. The pouring rain could have helped dilute the acid from affecting Wolf, and neither lived long enough to really be shown whether the acid did in fact hit Wolf. Another explanation is that the Alien, when it was gestating in a Predator, picks up some of the characteristics from its host, including the counter-acidic blood so as to have less acidic blood. This makes sense, as the Predalien also \"inherits\" the at least two Predator physical traits. The unique reproductive capability of directly implanting Alien embryos inside a living host (without the intermediation of facehuggers) is also something never before seen in the series, so that is presumably a characteristic inherited from the Predator as well. The directors have explained that originally they intended for the Alien blood to burn holes in anything it touched, including walls, floors and even the Predators arm during the final battle. However, this ended up becoming unrealised due to budget restraints."

As Vittoria is approaching the security scan, she passes his open office door, scans her eye, finds the blood on her chin, and proceeds into the secured chamber, where she finds his eye lying on the floor. Horrified, she exits the chamber and goes into his office, where she finds his body. Thus, the method used by the assassin (Nikolaj Lie Kaas) was to kill Bentivoglio in his office, cut out his eye, and then use the eye to pass the retinal scan, thus obtaining entrance into the secured chamber in order to steal the antimatter. In fact, the assassin himself can be seen walking in the opposite direction as Vittoria heads down the hall to the secured chamber.",
            "Robert, Vittoria, and the camerlengo locate the antimatter canister in St Peter's Tomb in the Necropolis. When Vittoria tries to change the battery, she realizes how cold it is in the tomb and that the chill may have more quickly depleted the battery such that there may not be the five minutes left in order to change it. The camerlengo grabs the canister, commandeers the helicopter waiting to evacuate the Cardinals, and flies it high over the city where he sets it on autopilot then parachutes out. The bomb goes off fairly harmlessly to the city below. The camerlengo is subsequently hailed as a savior and a \"gift\" from heaven, and there is talk that he should be named pope by an Acclamation of Adoration. Meanwhile, Vittoria and Robert retire to Commander Richter (Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd)'s office so that Vittoria can retrieve Bentivoglio's journals. As Vittoria lifts the journals from the desk, a computer screen pops up. Wondering whether the key that he took from Richter's hand might fit the computer and whether the computer might hold security recordings, Robert inserts the key, and a recording made in the papal office pops up. The recording is of a conversation between Richter and the camerlengo in which it is made clear that the whole Illuminati threat was cooked up by the camerlengo himself in order to feign an attack on the Church by the Illuminati. The camerlengo turns the fifth brand upon himself and, when the Swiss Guard breaks into the room, he names Richter as an Illuminatus. Richter is shot and killed. Robert shows the recording to Cardinal Strauss (Armin Mueller-Stahl). When the camerlengo is summoned to the conclave, he is met with cold stares and subsequently sets himself on fire with oil from one of the 99 holy lamps inside St. Peter's Basilica. The Vatican announces that the camerlengo has died from internal injuries suffered during his fall and that three preferiti were killed in the fire at Santa Maria della Vittoria Church. White smoke pours from the chimney, and Cardinal Baggia of Italy is named the new Pope. In the final scenes, Cardinal Strauss (now the new camerlengo) presents Robert with Galileo's Diagramma, asking only that he return it when finished and that he write about the Church gently. Cardinal Baggia bows his head to Robert and, as the new Pope Luke, goes out on his balcony to address the cheering crowd in St Peter's Square."

He recognizes Loki just before being turned into a puppet mentally controlled by Loki himself (as foretold in the post-credits sequence in Thor). Later in the film, he is used (due to his knowledge of the Tesseract) to open the dimensional portal.\u2022 Jane Foster's absence in the film is explained by Agent Coulson who, being aware of the coming threats, tells Thor she had been sent to a remote and secure location in Troms\u00f8, Norway.\u2022 The new Stark Tower is finished, which was 12% (one could argue 15%) personally designed by Pepper Potts, suggesting that she and Tony Stark really started a relationship by the end of Iron Man 2, and that Stark is becoming less egocentric, one small step at a time. The construction marks a significant gap of time between that film and The Avengers. Also, Tony Stark states that he's now in the clean energy business, which could potentially connect with Iron Man 3.\u2022 The ambiguous ending in The Incredible Hulk is finally explained, showing that Dr. Bruce Banner has finally come to embrace The Hulk, even to the point of transforming at will but usually preferring not to.\u2022 The mystery marksman briefly shown in Thor is revealed to be Hawkeye, who is established as having joined S.H.I.E.L.D. before The Black Widow did, given the fact that he recruited her some time ago, mentioning several missions together prior to her appearance in Iron Man 2. Hints at a sexual tension are present between both characters throughout the movie.\u2022 Coulson attacks Loki with a weapon created from the remains of the Destroyer that appeared in Thor.\u2022 Loki reminds Thor that they are not truly brothers; that he is, in fact, the son of Laufey, King of the Frost Giants of J\u00f6tunheim. Thor later says (in a moment of humor) that Loki is adopted.\u2022 The Tesseract (Captain America: The First Avenger's MacGuffin) is central to this film's story, having been found by Howard Stark while trying to locate Steve Rogers in the Arctic. It's been used as a prototype limitless power source until Loki comes into play.\u2022 Steve Rogers is clearly nostalgic/angry due the loss of his allies and friends from the 1940s and by the decades he's missed in his 70 years of suspended animation; therefore, he has been very recently awakened. This is reinforced by several jokes at his expense, particularly his anachronistic demeanor and his ignorance of modern technology and references.\u2022 Loki questions how Thor was able to travel to Earth due to the destruction of the Bifrost, and implies that Odin had to summon dark power to send him to Earth.\u2022 A subplot shows how HYDRA's weaponry, found at the time Captain America was rescued, has been reverse-engineered by S.H.I.E.L.D. as official weaponry in case the Avengers Initiative fails.\u2022 Bruce Banner states that the last time he was in New York, he \"kind of broke Harlem.\" This is in reference to his battle against the Abomination at the end of The Incredible Hulk.\u2022 Agent Coulson is an obsessive fan of Captain America, even having trading cards, a callback to the Captain America merchandise.\u2022 Loki is back due to Thanos' intervention. He gave Loki the scepter to lead the Chitauri army, and his presence will lead to further cosmic conflicts in succeeding Marvel Studios films.",
            "It appears as if for Hulk's first featured transformation, Loki was in some way influencing things. Romanoff says as much when inviting Banner to remove himself from the situation. There is also a somewhat dreamlike nature to the scene, with Thor's \"petty humans\" line, Stark rubbing his temples (as Banner did when he sees Loki arrive on the boat), without realizing it Banner picks up Loki's staff and so on (suggesting something unnatural going on) plus the strange camera movements and framing. With the second transformation, Banner was free from such interference. Arguments can also be made that (1) the first transformation was under stress after a fall during an attack whereas the second was a free choice; (2) the conversations with Stark about letting loose and realizing the Hulk absorbing the gamma radiation saved Banner, coupled with security guard's comment that the Hulk aimed for the abandoned factory, allowed Banner to realize that if he embraced the Hulk he could work with him. This is consistent with the character(s) of Bruce Banner and the Hulk; when provoked unexpectedly, the Hulk destroys in a blind rage, but when called upon by Banner's righteous anger, he can maintain a primitive understanding of friend and enemy; (3) that he was actually in control in the first instance, but he was angry with SHIELD and specifically Romanoff, for putting him in that situation and they were feeling his rage (perhaps still in part due to Loki's influence). He isn't on some out of control rampage, he stalks Romanoff, and then his attention is turned to Thor and the pilot.Much of Banner's character revelation comes through subtext in his interactions with Tony Stark. Stark realises early that Banner is in control (and tests this theory by pricking him with something sharp that zaps him with a small electrical charge). All other characters in the film see Banner as an unstable element (including Romanoff, who brings a SWAT team with her to collect him), but Stark, knowing Banner's secret, treats and respects him as a peer. Later in Manhattan, Stark asks if Banner has arrived yet, but none of the team know what he's talking about, having already written Banner off. The simple answer to this question, then, is in the transformations seen in the film. The first time, Banner is shown to try to prevent the transformation. He is at odds with Hulk, not wanting to do harm to the people on the base. He is internally conflicted and loses control. The second time, as predicted by Stark, he brings Hulk to the battle with intent and thus is balanced and in control. When Iron Man is falling out from the portal, the audience is led to believe that Thor is going to rescue him, but it's the Hulk who jumps in to save his friend. Right before he enters his final battle in The Incredible Hulk (2008) (2008), Bruce says to General Ross and Betty that he can't control it but maybe he can \"aim it.\" The last scene of the movie ends with him in a cabin in the woods meditating. In meditation, he opens his eyes and they are Hulk green as the \"Incident Counter\" drops to from 31 days to 0. This is followed by a simple grin and a cut to the Avengers cut scene.",
            "Agent Coulson is killed by Loki midway through the film. Clark Gregg, the actor who plays Coulson, had said that Coulson's death was an essential part of the story and that he would miss playing the character but was satisfied with the way his story ended. However, Coulson is alive in the TV series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (2013-) as he was brought back to life using experimental medical technology on the orders of Nick Fury. As Gregg has reprized his role as Coulson, his statement to the media was perhaps (magician-like) misdirection on his or the studio's part. The nature of Coulson's resurrection turns out to be somewhat sketchy, though: His resurrected incarnation may not really be himself. Regardless, it's possible that Gregg will appear as Coulson on the silver screen again, much later.",
            "Shawarma is a popular Levantine Arab meat preparation, where lamb, goat, chicken, turkey, beef, or mixed meats are placed on a spit (commonly a vertical spit in restaurants), and may be grilled for as long as a day. Shavings are cut off the block of meat for serving, and the remainder of the block of meat is kept heated on the rotating spit. Although it can be served in shavings on a plate (generally with accompaniments), \"shawarma\" also refers to a pita bread sandwich or wrap made with shawarma meat. Shawarma is eaten with tabbouleh, fattoush, taboon bread, tomato, and cucumber. Toppings include tahini, hummus, pickled turnips and amba. Shawarma is a fast-food staple across the Middle East, Europe and the Caucasus. A post-title scene at the very end of the closing credits shows the team in the shawarma restaurant, presumably after the final battle, looking collectively exhausted and eating. A large sign in the background declares the restaurant has the \"best shawarma in the city\". During the battle with the Chitauri, there's a very quick shot of a shawarma restaurant in the background. It's likely the same one that Stark refers to when everyone's standing over him after the battle.",
            "During the Chitauri invasion, Bruce Banner reunites with the rest of the Avengers to take the fight to Loki. This is because he had found the Tesseract's location on his computer just before Hawkeye's assault on the Helicarrier, but the attack began before Banner could reveal his findings.",
            "His plan was to manipulate the Avengers into fighting with each other long enough for Hawkeye (and Hulk) to take out the Helicarrier, which would cripple S.H.I.E.L.D.'s ability to stop the Chitauri. Also, had it worked, the Avengers likely would've died with the Helicarrier, removing them as well. The only way he could successfully do so was to continue manipulating them while on the ship. If he had run, it would only unite them against him, and leave them off the Helicarrier when it crashed. As Nick Fury says about Loki, \"Why do I get the feeling he's the only one of us who wants to be here?\""

            "Trapped in the trees by Azog and his army of warg-riding orcs, Gandalf, the dwarves, and Bilbo climb higher to escape the wargs' snarling jaws as they leap against the trees, toppling them over the cliff. Unnoticed by anyone, Gandalf catches a moth, whispers to it, and sets it flying. He then begins hurling pinecone fireballs to the dwarves, who catch and re-hurl them at the wargs, igniting the entire ground in flames. While the dwarves and Bilbo hang from a tree precariously dangling over the cliff, Thorin rushes toward Azog but is easily knocked down and about to be beheaded by an orc. Bilbo unsheathes his sword and rushes into the melee to save Thorin from certain death. Spurred on by Bilbo's bravery, the other dwarves follow, but the orcs obviously have the upper hand. Suddenly, a flock of giant eagles, summoned by the moth, swoop in and begin saving dwarves and tossing orcs and wargs off the cliff. The eagles carry off Gandalf, Bilbo, Thorin, and the other dwarves and deposit them safely on the Carrock, a tall monolith in the middle of the River Anduin. Gandalf successfully revives Thorin, who heartily apologizes to Bilbo for doubting his bravery and dedication. As the Great Eagles fly away home, Thorin directs everyone's attention to the sight of Erebor, the last dwarven kingdom in the Lonely Mountain of Middle-earth. \"I do believe the worst is behind us,\" sighs Bilbo. Meanwhile, under a blanket of gold coins inside the Lonely Mountain, the sleeping dragon Smaug opens one eye.",
            "A similar question also comes up by some viewers of the film version of The Return of the King, and the answer is largely the same: The Eagles of Middle-earth are sentient beings with intelligence and pride, not beasts of burden. Every time Gandalf calls upon an Eagle to help him he is asking for a favor in a dire situation and not making a command of them. This may not be as clear in the film versions because the backstory of the Eagles is not given nor do they speak as they do in the books. In this film, the Eagles left the heroes short of their goal because they were asked to save them from the Orcs and nothing more. Furthermore, since they are indebted to neither the dwarves nor their mission, the Eagles would not, at this point, put themselves at such risk by going so near to Smaug, i.e., they would have nothing to gain from doing so. They also tell Gandalf that they would go nowhere near where men lived and risk getting shot at, \"for they would think we were after their sheep. And at other times they would be right\" (from the chapter titled \"Out of the Frying-Pan into the Fire\")."

            "The tapes are found by MacReady and Copper. The tapes show them placing thermite charges on a section of the ship in order to clear the ice. The director of this film said they altered this because they just couldn't justify using thermite explosives to completely clear the ice from the surface of the ship.\nHowever, we also don't see the excavation of the specimen or the spaceship in the film. So it's possible they had cleared a section of the ship from the surface, which we see in the footage in the 1982 film. But obviously they weren't getting this all done in one day. So had planned to return the following day to continue excavating the ship after studying the creature.It's been suggested that this could be reconnected to say the charges were used to help clear the cavern the researchers use to access the ship.",
            "In the 1982 film, it's implied the chopper was loaded with kerosene to dispatch the dog and any other potential infected creatures. However, in this film they mention they have a chopper, but it was off getting refuelled. It would stand to reason that the helicopter was getting fuel but also refilling the kerosene containers for the camp. For lamps, generators, snowcats, extra fuel for the helicopter, etc.So when Lars grabs the thermite grenades (in an extended scene that was deleted from the theatrical cut) and boards the helicopter, all this fuel would have already been on board.",
            "Mattias would have seen the devastation of the camp when he first arrived. As soon as he landed, he saw the burnt remains of the \"splitface\" creature. That likely would have been enough for him to keep an open mind and Lars could have filled him in on the rest while they were chasing after the dog-thing.",
            "Kate, Carter, Adam, Jameson, and Griggs are all American. Juliette is French-Canadian and Colin is English. So it's safe to say that, if they are sent to a Norwegian base, there would at least be some Norwegians that spoke English. The Norwegian crew seems to consist primarily of specialized scientists and mechanics (for research and technical support/transportation), and very few blue-collar workers (for heavy labor/service). In the film, the only Norwegian character who can't speak English is Lars. Since the majority of the population of Norway can speak English to some extent, as the primary foreign language taught at schools is English, anybody who is looking to go into a scientific field or any job where it's likely they will need to collaborate with other countries, it would be a fair assumption that they would already know or choose to learn English. Lars, being a mechanic and laborer of sorts would not need to learn English for his duties, but as we see throughout the film, he is still able to communicate with Kate on a very basic level as Lars has likely been exposed to enough English throughout his life to pick up on some of it. We never see if the helicopter pilot Matias could speak English as he never gets the opportunity on screen. Lars and Matias are the Norwegians seen at the beginning of the 1982 film; none of the English speaking Norwegians survive.",
            "When Kate realizes that the Thing can copy its victims on a cellular level, she runs outside and attempts to flag down the chopper. Jameson tries to convince Carter to keep going. When Carter decides to take the chopper down and land, the Griggs-Thing may have figured it had been discovered or soon would be. So it decided to try and assimilate all on board to crash the helicopter so the humans had no way of escaping. Or it could possibly have wanted to assimilate both chopper pilots so it could fly to safety. It is also possible that, as Griggs was the first confirmed assimilated human, the Thing's control over that form was less precise than it would later become through later assimilations. Also, Griggs' untimely metamorphosis was simply a result of that lack of control causing a \"meltdown\" of sorts when it detected a threat as Griggs is shown to stop talking and moving for a few seconds before the Thing reveals itself within him.",
            "There's two theories for this:(1) Because it was critically wounded and needed some form of \"life-support\". Remember that Edvard was very close to the explosion of Peder's flamethrower, getting the full blast of the shockwave. It seems that the Thing's real weaknesses are fire and large explosions (also suggested when MacReady dispatches the Palmer-Thing with an explosive in the 1982 movie) and explained by arguing that the large impact of an explosion could also damage them sufficiently on a cellular level. Apparently, each Thing has the capacity to regenerate fairly quickly, as evidenced when Split-Face comes to live again a day later inside the American camp after being completely burnt. The Edvard-Thing was obviously weakened up to the point where it literally fell apart by the arms, and could only effectively defend itself with a tentacle grown for that purpose. Probably because it could not regenerate instantly, it looked for more tissue to repair itself in order to sustain the host's body. Finch's body acted as a \"transplant\", not unlike a piece of skin that is transplanted to take over the function of damaged skin. This would mean that the Thing is actually a disease expanding, over the theory that the Thing is sentient.(2) Because it was preparing to fight more viciously. Although Edvard is a Thing at that time, and Things are very resilient, they are by no means invincible. Having seen that humans had enough fire to fight back, and in a desperate effort, the Edvard-Thing detaches its arms to expand itself in territory (similar to the Spider-Head in the 1982 film), while the main body looks for more tissue, finding it in Finch, and fuses faces with him (and later the entire body). Once the process is finished, Split-Face starts to fight back, in any way possible. This could be an interesting parallel with how the Blair-Thing in the 1982 movie forced its hand into Garry's face and mouth, and also fused with his body in order to become much bigger and stronger. Apparently, this is something the Thing can do when it feels seriously threatened and needs to engage in direct combat, rather than hiding, demonstrating a sentient demeanor over a merely biological struggle for survival.",
            "In order:Henrik: Discovers where the recently-thawed-out Thing was hiding; The Thing fires one of its tentacles at him, impaling him through his chest and spraying his blood all over Olav. The Thing then pulls Henrik's body into itself and begins to assimilate him before being torched by the group.Griggs: Griggs reveals himself as a Thing on the chopper. And either dies when the helicopter crashes, or is still frozen within the wreckage.Olav: After being sprayed in the face with infected blood, Olav becomes very ill as he is being taken over by the Thing's cells. Fearing he is stricken with some foreign disease, Carter, Jameson and Griggs decide to evac him in a helicopter to a nearby medical station. When Kate tries to flag down the chopper, Griggs reveals himself as a Thing and attacks Olav. The last we see is the chopper crashing.Juliette: Leads Kate to a room where a set of keys are supposed to be stored. Being secluded, Juliette reveals herself as a Thing in order to try and assimilate Kate. However, Kate escapes and Lars burns the Juliette-Thing with a flamethrower.Karl: As Kate is being chased by the Juliette-Thing, Karl walks out into the hall to see what the commotion is about. Juliette-Thing impales Karl in the chest and begins to assimilate him before Lars burns her with a flamethrower. Once the Juliette-thing is dealt with, there is a deleted scene where the group goes back to deal with Karl's body. They find he had moved into another room and was about 90% re-animated before Lars torched him. The group then take his and Juliette's body outside and burn them completely. (Note: Juliette and Karl are the two burnt bodies laying nearby to \"Splitface Thing\" when they are seen by MacReady and Copper in the 1982 film)Peder: Standing off with a flamethrower against Carter and Jameson, whom he suspects are Things, Edvard tries to convince him to kill them. When Peder is about to fire at Carter and Jameson, Jameson shoots him in the head. Peder can be heard groaning and gasping for air, clearly in his death throes. So Edvard goes to check on him. Jameson also punctured the napalm tank on the flame-thrower when he shot him. It explodes, injuring Edvard.Edvard: Severely injured in an explosion from multiple burns, he is dragged into the rec room when his arm detaches, and he is revealed to be a Thing.Jonas: While dragging the injured Edvard back to the rec room, Edvard's arm detaches, crawls up Jonas' arm, and latches onto his face to start assimilating him very slowly. Kate torches Jonas to end his suffering.Adam: The Edvard-Thing impales Adam in the stomach, which seems to cause some form of paralysis. Edvard-Thing then lays down beside Adam and begins to bond with him. Adam's body is absorbed, and his face melds with Edvard's remaining visage. Edvard-Thing and Adam have now become Splitface. Splitface is burned by Kate and supposedly killed. In the 1982 film, MacReady and Copper discover the charred remains and bring it back to their base where it attacks Bennings and is then finally disposed for good by the American survivors.Jameson: Stabbed through the lung by one of Edvard-Thing's tentacles, seems to drown in his own blood. Kate then burns his body with a flamethrower to ensure he wasn't infected.Sander: Attacked, killed and assimilated by the Splitface, the Sander-Thing is destroyed when Kate throws a thermite grenade into its mouth.Carter: Burned by Kate with a flamethrower when she realized he was a Thing.Kate: Either froze to death in the snowcat or made it to the Russian research base that was mentioned earlier. A fringe possibility is that she had become infected on the alien ship and is in the process of being assimilated and opted to simply sit there and wait it out. In their DVD commentary, the writers/directors/producers put forward the theory that she returned to the camp, discovered that Lars had taken off in pursuit of the dog, and followed him to the American camp in the snowcat, arriving in time to rescue MacReady and Childs at the end of the John Carpenter film. So far none of these theories have been solidly confirmed or debunked. Though given that the original film takes place over 5 or 6 days, it likely wouldn't have taken her that long to reach the U.S. base. So the Russian base is the most logical destination.Colin: Commits suicide by slashing his own throat and wrists with a straight-razor, possibly out of fear or paranoia.Lars: Survives the events of the film. The morning after the events he is met by Matias, and the two chase after the dog-Thing. Intended to be the character at the beginning of the 1982 film who is shot by Garry; he can be recognized by the beard and the special goggles with the slits.Matias (Helicopter Pilot): Arrives the morning after the events, where he is met by Lars at the destroyed camp. The two chase after the dog-Thing. Intended to be the character who goes after the grenade and is killed at the beginning of the 1982 film.",
            "Much like the 1982 movie, there's no way to truly tell who was assimilated and when. All we have at best are theories:Griggs was probably assimilated by the recently-escaped Thing when he went out to get the drinks from the American helicopter. Juliette may have been assimilated after examining the remains of the Henrik-Thing. When Juliette runs out of the examination room, the first person she runs into is Griggs. Seeing the opportunity, the Griggs-Thing may have followed her to the bathroom where he assimilated her. As a result, the blood in the shower and the teeth fillings may have belonged to Juliette. Although, if this were the case, both Human-Things would have had plenty of time to clean up the evidence (blood and fillings) in the bathroom before the helicopter left in the morning, which implies that this assimilation was done hurriedly with no time to clean up, possibly to assimilate Griggs quickly before the helicopter left, so that the Thing could reach civilization.Another possible outcome is that Juliette was being assimilated slowly on a cellular level from within, and her sickness (supposedly nausea at seeing Henrik-Thing's remains) was really a sign of her assimilation accelerating from within her body (this theory can be supported by one interpretation of the 1982 film- when Norris is briefly seen clutching his chest in pain just before suffering an apparent heart attack - it has been speculated that this was the result of the Thing completing its assimilation, as he's revealed shortly after). She then ran to the bathroom, where full assimilation may have taken place. However, neither film gives us a definitive example of this type of assimilation - the only kind ever depicted on-screen is quick and violent - although both films hint that this is possible.In regards to when Edvard was potentially assimilated, the forgotten component is the dog. The dog was one of the earliest infected and then not seen until the end. It is possible that while the dog was roaming around the base, it assimilated Edvard, and then the Edvard-Thing returned to the group, whilst the dog remained hidden until the end of the film. Also, the dog's kennel is the first instance shown in the film of an assimilation taking place (holes in both the wall and the cage, and blood all over). This means that the dog is also a possible assimilator of either Griggs or Juliette.As for Carter, he and Kate were separated for an extended period while on the Thing's spaceship, giving Sander-Thing ample time to get to him. This probably occurred off-screen, just after Carter turns around because he hears something. As to why his clothing was left intact, remember in the '82 film, Blair-Thing shoves his hand in to Garry's face to essentially fuse with him. This is likely how Carter was assimilated.",
            "Kate and Carter pursue the Sander-Thing to the spaceship buried in the ice. They climb on board and the ship begins to power up. Kate falls into the ship separating her from Carter. While trying to find a way out, Kate is confronted by the Sander-Thing, and she throws a thermite grenade into its mouth that kills the Sander-Thing when it detonates. Just as this happens, Carter appears with the flamethrower and the two of them escape the tunnel and enter the snowcat with Carter saying that there is a Russian base nearby they can get to. Kate takes the flamethrower from him and says she'll put it in the back. Kate then says to Carter that the reason she knew Carter was human before was because of his earring, which is now missing. He tries to convince her she was mistaken, however Kate shoots him with the flamethrower and we hear the tormented and unworldly screams of the Thing... revealing that Kate was right to conclude that Carter was a Thing replicant. Kate then gets in another snowcat and stares blankly through the windshield, emotionally drained, utterly alone and possibly going to the Russian base Carter mentioned. During the credits, we see the Norwegian helicopter and pilot arriving at the near-destroyed base to find Lars. Then, the dog that was assimilated early in the film is seen fleeing from the scene. Lars and chopper pilot Matias (Ole Martin Aune Nilsen) pursue it, and Lars begins shooting at it, just like in the opening scenes of John Carpenter's The Thing (1982).",
            "When the Edvard-Thing reveals itself and starts attacking people, most of the group scatter and Colin gets separated from the rest. He locks himself in a control room and we don't see him until the very end of the film when we see his frozen body gripping a straight-razor and his throat is slashed. A deleted scene available on the DVD and the Blu-ray disc reveals that Colin was cornered by one of the Arm-Things that detached themselves from Edvard-Thing. Colin decided to end his life on his own terms, and opt for a quick death rather than the slow painful death the Arm-Thing would probably give him (look what happened to Jonas). Director Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. has said Colin's death scene was filmed but was left out of the main movie because it took the focus away from Carter and Kate.",
            "This is answered at the beginning of John Carpenter's The Thing (1982). Lars and Matias pursue the dog to the United States Outpost 31 Camp, several miles away from the Norwegian camp. Lars shooting at the dog brings the attention of the members of the camp, where they land the chopper to pursue the dog on foot. Lars tries to throw a grenade, but it accidentally slips out of his hand and lands beside the helicopter. Matias frantically tries to dig it out of the snow in order to save the helicopter. The grenade explodes, killing Matias and destroying their helicopter. The dog jumps up on Bennings, one of the American camp members hoping that Lars wouldn't shoot at it with a human in the line of fire. Lars tries to warn them that the dog is not in fact a dog, but seeing as how he can't speak English and the Americans don't speak Norwegian, this was futile. Finally, Lars gives up and continues shooting at the dog, wounding Bennings in the process. At this point, Garry, the camp's station manager, responds with deadly force and shoots Lars through the eye, killing him instantly. The American team later adds the dog to their own, setting into motion a chain of events similar to those seen in this film.Note: there's a slight continuity error in this film that leads to some confusion/debate in the 1982 film. In the 82 film, you'll notice that the person shooting at the dog from the chopper has a fur-lined hood on his coat. This is also the same person who drops the grenade and gets killed in the explosion. Which means it was the pilot wearing the blue outfit and got shot in the eye. However, in this film, Lars is dressed exactly like the character who gets shot and is seen in the gunner position at the end. Mattias is dressed nearly identical to Lars as well. However, it was this film's intention that Lars was the one who was shot.",
            "The plausible explanation is that the Thing had just been thawed out in this film and had never encountered a human being before, therefore it didn't really know what to expect from them and possibly felt they didn't pose much threat. It was able to assimilate a couple of people early on but felt that humans were best assimilated by hostile takeover. It wasn't until it was defeated repeatedly by the humans that it realized organized humans can be a serious threat, and it needed to be more methodical in its assimilation of them, more or less playing chess with the humans, and divide-and-conquer them in order to try and win. This could also be explained with the dog that escapes the camp. It remains hidden throughout the film, perhaps watching undetected, waiting for an opportunity to escape. Of course, it does wind up escaping at the end, and it could be said that it had learned from the mistakes of the other creatures.However, we have no idea how Thing replicants can communicate with each other, but they obviously have a way, perhaps through some form of telepathy or extra sensory perception. So the dog could have remained hidden but known how the other creatures failed in their attacks. By the time the dog reached the American camp, it knew how it could better defeat its opponents. There are more instances in this movie where the Thing is identified, and it has no choice but to reveal itself and take action. Examples are in the helicopter (when it knows it is about to be discovered by Kate) and when Edvard's arm falls off, and it knows it needs to defend itself from the other humans. In the 1982 movie, the Thing could go on for a much longer time undetected, but it would surface there as well when it knew it was discovered.Another thing to consider is that the Thing revealing itself simply occurs on-screen more often. This generally happens when the takeover does not succeed or when it is detected. For example, it must have revealed itself to Griggs, Juliette and Edvard (whom are later revealed to be Thing replicants), but we never see this, as to maintain the surprise. We see it as it reveals itself to Kate, but Kate escapes and warns the rest; had the Thing succeeded in infecting Kate undetected, that would not have been shown in order to keep Kate's infection a secret. The Thing had a lot more successful undetected takeovers in the 1982 film (probably because it learned to be more cautious, as explained above), which occurred off-screen as a story-telling device, keeping the audience guessing about the Thing's motives, methods and whereabouts. Take for example the scene where the dog-Thing enters a room with an unknown person's shadow on the wall, which implies that the Thing revealed itself there and took over the person.On a more practical note, the budget and state of special effects in 1982 only allowed for a limited amount of transformation scenes, so keeping a lot of the Thing's assimilations off-screen was an effective way to control the budget. The 2011 movie probably had a bigger budget, and developments in both practical special effects and computer-generated visual effects allowed the makers more opportunities to show the Thing revealing itself. Also, the 2011 movie is mainly directed at fans of the 1982 film, who are familiar with the Thing's modus operandi and capabilities; so this prequel no longer needs to leave out a lot of information for the purpose of building tension, it can now visualize what the audience already knows.",
            "Director Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. has stated on his facebook fansite that Kate originally discovered the body of the ill-fated Pilot of the ship hanging there. However, following test screenings, this idea was vetoed by the studio, and the 'Tetris-like structure' was animated and imposed over the pilot. The device may represent the source of power for the ship, because while it is operating, the ship is also powering up; and when Kate blows up the Sander-Thing, it stands next to the device, destroying it, and the ship immediately powers down. Alternatively, it is some sort of mapping device. It consists of cubes that form changing patches of yellow and blue, which may represent oceans and continents. So the device may be making a scan of the Earth and draw a three-dimensional map of it, so that the Thing can decide upon its next destination. In the final cut, it's simply never explained.",
            "In the 1982 film, the characters come across some shredded clothing belonging to people who were supposedly assimilated. However, this is something MacReady theorized, and it was never proven one way or the other. It's entirely possible this was something the Thing didn't need to do but was something it did to create misdirection as it did with MacReady, framing him being assimilated when, in actuality, he was still human. There was another pair of mysterious shredded long-johns that Nauls finds, but we never find out who they belonged to. When Windows finds Bennings being assimilated, he sees his clothes bloody and shredded. So the thing ripped through Bennings' clothes to take him over.In this film, there was evidence of people being assimilated but no shredded clothes were ever found. It's entirely possible the people were assimilated and the clothes were simply disposed. We know one person was assimilated in a shower stall, so it's likely they were naked at the time of assimilation and the thing simply got dressed when it was finished. We see that when Henrik was attacked, he was being absorbed into the creature, this is likely where it would simply discard the clothes as opposed to ripping through them. As we saw in the 1982 film, the Blair-Thing attacks Garry and simply shoves his hand into Garry's face and bonds with him completely, not needing to rip through his clothes. Likely how Carter was assimilated in this film.So it stands to argue that if the Thing needs to assimilate someone very quickly, it may \"swallow the person whole\" so to speak and then spit out what it can't copy such as clothes. If the creature assimilates on a cellular level or by \"bonding\" it wouldn't need to rip through the victim's clothes.",
            "Exactly what went down during Lars' confrontation with the pilots is intentionally left ambiguous. Lars appeared to have been overpowered when he was attacked, leaving three possibilities as to what happened afterwords. (1) Lars was knocked out by Carter and Jameson, in which case they took the flamethrower from him, and he woke up at some point later on. (2) When Lars was attacked, he was taken by surprise and unable to react properly, so Carter and Jameson took the flamethrower by force. After this point, Lars figured he would be a primary suspect (as Carter and Jameson both were, and it was believed Lars was dead, him showing up again could be misinterpreted as him being infected). The next morning it was clear that he was alone in the base, hence the reason he was willing to come out. (3) A combination of both. Lars was initially knocked out and had his flamethrower taken, but then regained consciousness and remained hidden.This does, however, bring up the question of why the Thing didn't try to attack the isolated and possibly vulnerable Lars. There are three theories about this:1. The Thing concluded that since he had been alone for so long, he could easily draw suspicion (this has been suggested as a reason towards the theory that it killed Fuchs in the 1982 film). The rest of the team believed he had been killed, and Carter and Jameson were both primary suspects, so if he showed up after apparently dying, they could easily suspect that the two pilots had infected him. Because of this, it could be that it just did not yet see the need to infect Lars when he would be largely suspected, and only later on saw an advantage in taking over an isolated victim (namely Blair).2. It might have seen the other humans as a higher priority, due to being a greater threat at the time. Assuming Lars was knocked out, there would not have been anything he could do to destroy it. However, Kate, Carter, and what little was left of the expedition did still have the means to destroy it, so it did the practical thing and went after them first, in which case it would have attacked Lars once the immediate threat was out of the way.3. It may have simply had no easy opportunity to infect Lars. As after Carter and Jameson attack Lars, this is basically when all hell breaks loose and the Edvard-Finch-Thing (Splitface) and the Sander-Thing are on the offensive until the end of the movie. All the while, Lars was somewhere outside the main complex. He must have regained consciousness and probably locked himself in, armed with a gun. The Dog-Thing, which was still somewhere in the base, probably knew that Lars was extremely paranoid and very hard to ambush. Knowing it was the only Thing left (since Edvard-Thing had not returned), Dog-Thing decided not to take any more chances with the Norwegians, leave the base and try out with a new set of victims. Thus setting the beginning of The Thing (1982) where Lars is one of of the 2 Norwegian Pilot who died",
            "The story focuses on the Norwegian camp that is visited by MacReady and Copper. Here are a number of story elements that directly lead up to John Carpenter's 1982 film, in order in which they appear in the 2011 movie:Mac and Copper find the giant block of ice in which the creature was initially contained. Blair later looks at a picture of the Norwegians posing proudly with the recently obtained block (though this occurs off-screen in the 2011 movie; we only see the Norwegians return to base with the block of ice).We see Jonas walking around the camp with a video camera, documenting the moment where they take a sample from the ice-encased Thing. The Americans come across all his video footage in the 1982 film (they only view the moment of the discovery of the spaceship, but Copper mentions there is about 9 hours worth of footage, so they didn't bother to watch all of it).What Blair theorized in a crude computer animation in the 1982 movie is visually confirmed here when Kate and Adam look at a sample of Henrik's blood under a microscope: the Thing's blood cells infect the host cells and then take on the appearance of the host's cells.A blood test similar to the one suggested by Copper is brought up in this film, only to be prevented by the Thing burning the lab. The fact that the characters did come close to performing the test (and might have implemented it had the lab not been destroyed) could be what motivated it to sabotage the blood in a more discrete manner at Outpost 31 before such a thing was considered.MacReady and Copper find two burnt human corpses, lying a few yards from Splitface (they are hard to see due to the camera angle, and easy to mistake for part of Splitface). These are most likely the remains of Juliette and Karl, who were burnt after the Juliette-Thing tried to attack Kate but wound up impaling Karl.The Edvard/Finch-Thing a.k.a. Splitface is the creature that MacReady and Copper find outside burned in the snow. They bring it to their base. Splitface later assimilates Bennings, another member of the team before it is finally disposed of completely.The holes in the walls in several of the hallways around the base were the result of explosions and resulting fires caused by the detonation of the flamethrower Peder had, and the one that was used by Kate. The blown-out holes are clearly seen in the 1982 film while MacReady and Copper are investigating the remains of the base.Carter sticks a bloody axe in a wall near the door to the storage room and leaves it there (at Kate's suggestion as not to touch any of the blood on it) after killing one of the detached arms from the Edvard-Thing. This is the door that Mac forces open while exploring the ruins of the base; the axe is still in there.Colin commits suicide by cutting his own wrists and throat. Upon searching the base and entering the door with the axe in it, Mac and Copper find Colin's frozen body in the room behind it. A series of blood stains leading to the chair suggest that he already cut himself prior to sitting down. A deleted scene from The Thing (2011) indeed confirms that Colin sliced his wrist while standing, and then sat down to slice his throat.The heat blast from the spaceship's engines melt the ceiling of the ice cavern, leaving the open crater which Norris, Palmer, and Mac discover, though this seems at odds with what appears to happen in the 1982 film, as the Norwegian tapes implied that thermite charges had been used to make the hole. However, it could be said that thermite charges were used to open the \"access cave\" seen in the film.The ending of the film sees Lars and Matias chase after the dog-Thing in the helicopter and shooting at it with a rifle, leading directly into the opening of the 1982 film. Of note is that their appearance and that of the helicopter are mostly identical.",
            "There are some homages to the original movies that fans may recognize:The theatrical poster depicting an unidentifiable man in front of a white desolate background and the implication of being infected is clearly inspired by the theatrical poster for the 1982 film.The film opens with the text \"Antarctica, winter 1982\" on screen. The 1982 film had a title card with exactly the same text after the prologue. The movie's title itself burns into the screen, just as in the 1982, which in turn was a reference to the opening titles of The Thing from Another World (1951).The fossilized bear that Kate investigates in the beginning looks remarkably like the dog-Thing from the 1982 film.The blood test from the 1982 film is briefly mentioned, but as the equipment is destroyed at one point, the characters conceive of a crude \"teeth fillings\" test as a way to identify the Thing.While the Norwegians are singing their folk song, there is a shot of the block of ice in which the camera pans through the door and stops at the railing - identical to the scene in the 1982 film when we first see the block of ice.The two pilots navigating their way to the camp under seemingly impossible odds is similar to MacReady, whose guideline was cut by Nauls in the middle of a storm after he became a suspect.When powering up, the space ship's outside displays the blue glimmering effect that was also seen when the ship crashed in the opening scene of the 1982 movie.Inside the Thing's ship, the strange device seen by Kate before the Sander-Thing attacks her, could be an homage to the low-res computer simulation Blair made in the 1982 movie of the Thing's cells taking over and imitating dog cells.The music playing at the end scene during the credits is the same music playing in the 1982 movie when the Norwegians are in the helicopter hunting for the dog (which makes sense, as these scenes complement each other). The music that plays in the opening scene was also clearly inspired by the theme for the 1982 film.The scene where the wounded Edvard-Thing attacks everyone in the rec room is very similar to the 1982 film; the flamethrower to quickly dispatch the creature \"jams\" on the user allowing the creature to attack a few people. Also the way Jonas is \"dispatched\" is very similar to how Windows was in the 1982 film.In a deleted scene, Colin and Edvard try to call for a Med-evac for Olav. Edvard tells Colin to try calling the American base. Colin says \"U.S. Outpost 31\". In the actual movie, they mention taking a snowcat to \"the nearest Outpost\". When Copper and Mac are trying to decide on whether to investigate the Norwegian camp, Copper says \"we're the closest ones to them\"- this would suggest that they were actually going to go to Outpost 31.Initially, Carter mentions taking Olav to McMurdo base and Colin is later seen attempting to call them. This was the same base which Windows tried to contact early in the 1982 film, though it should be noted that this is actually a real location-McMurdo Sound, located on the Antarctic coast, which is home to a large international base.",
            "There, of course, is the previously mentioned Olav and Griggs things are never seen to have been destroyed. If Carter and Jameson could survive the helicopter crash, then certainly the Thing could have.\nAlso, there's a deleted scene where Colin is cornered in the radio room by one of the smaller arm-centipedes, which prompts him to commit suicide. But since it was deleted, this isn't canon and Colin's motivations for suicide are presumed to be due to paranoia."

            "Nina, as the White Swan, gets through the first scenes of the ballet okay but panics during the \"Dance of the Swans\" when the faces on all the swans begin to look like hers, causing the Prince to drop her, which enrages Thomas. When the scene is over, she returns to her dressing room in tears and sees Lily seated at her vanity in costume for the Black Swan. Snottily, Lily offers to dance the Black Swan for her. Enraged, Nina yells, \"Leave me alone!\" and smashes Lily (who has turned into the double) into a mirror, shattering it into bits. When the double tries suffocating her, Nina stabs her in the abdomen with a shard of mirror. She hides the body (who now looks like Lily again) in her bathroom and dresses for her turn as the Black Swan. Back onstage, Nina dances with abandon, wowing her partner as well as the audience. Suddenly, she begins to physically transform, her arms become black wings. As the audience gives her a standing ovation, Nina exits the stage, kisses Thomas passionately, and returns to her dressing room to change back into the dying White Swan, first covering up the blood on her floor with a towel. As she finishes with her makeup, she hears a knock at the door. It's Lily, alive and well, congratulating Nina on her amazing performance. When Lily is gone, Nina looks under the towel to find there is no blood. Suddenly, she becomes aware that she is bleeding from her abdomen and pulls out a shard of glass from the broken mirror. Despite her wound, Nina dances the last act until it becomes time for her to commit suicide. As she prepares to throw herself from the \"cliff\", she looks out over the audience and sees her mother smiling and crying. As Nina falls onto the mattress below, the blood stain begins to widen. The audience erupts in thunderous applause. The rest of the dancers gather around her, and Thomas invites her to take her bows. \"My little princess,\" he says, \"I always knew you had it in you.\" Suddenly, Lily gasps, and the blood stain can be seen across Nina's entire abdomen. Thomas calls for help and asks Nina what she did. \"I felt it,\" she replies. \"It was perfect.\" The crowd continues to roar with applause as the screen slowly fades to white.",
            "The most literal reading of the film is that, in the confrontation between Nina and Lily in the dressing room, Nina is really alone and it is herself that she stabs with the glass shard. This means that Lily is really alive at the end. Whether or not Nina actually dies is left unanswered. Thomas calls for help, and the screen slowly fades to white, leaving it up to the viewer to decide whether or not Nina survives. A least literal explanation is that, if we accept that the whole story is a metaphor of growing up, then she doesn't have to die. Since the mother of Nina has always affected her, Nina was prevented from growing up in order to keep her disciplined, which helps her to be perfect (e.g. after her metamorphosis, she mistakes in a part at the show). If we say that the film is about ascendancy, then killing herself (or her \"white side\") can be interpreted as accepting that she has to grow up."

            "Redridge fired one shot at Eli with his pistol and by the sounds of it, completely missed. The second shot, he took his time, gripped his pistol properly, aimed, fired and if you notice he hit Eli in his backpack. At this point Eli turned around and a shoot-out with Carnegie's men ensued. If we are going with realism here, it could be said that improper maintenance caused the pistol to be significantly less accurate, so even if Redridge was aiming directly at Eli, if there was a significant amount of dirt or build-up in the barrel, it could cause the bullet to stray far off course. This would explain why Redridge looked at the gun after he fired his first shot. As for the shot hitting Eli's backpack, it's possible it hit something inside his pack which stopped the bullet. Possibly one of his machetes, the bible, or something else. If you want to go with certain mystical qualities the film presents, it could be said that divine intervention stopped the bullets.\nAlternatively, several scenes hint that Redridge may be a reluctant killer in a brutal world, hiding a good heart beneath a normally uncompromising exterior and that he found himself unable to kill Eli without flinching at the last second and missing.",
            "It isn't stated but it's implied he died from his gunshot wound. He was shot in the gut and if he didn't receive proper medical care, he would have died slowly, but definitely would have died eventually. His condition must have worsened while Solara was driving him to San Francisco and he must have been beyond the help that the Alcatraz people could have given him.",
            "In the Bible, the high priest Eli was blind, and some might say that there are several scenes which may indicate that in the movie Eli was blind or at least partially blind: when hunting the cat, for example, he was sitting in a position where it didn't seem like he could actually see his target at all; in the opening fight, he cuts the man's hand off after being pushed, waiting until he's touched to get a sense of where to direct his blow with his machete. Also he lures the rest of them in to a dark tunnel before fighting them. In the house at the beginning, Eli looks at the sun from a window, but his eyes don't dilate. He has extraordinary hearing and sense of smell. He doesn't put on his sunglasses right away when walking outside, like everyone else does (he even appears to be staring directly at the sun). In several scenes, sounds of babies, shooting guns, movement, and sometimes almost insignificant sounds are emphasized. He searches the shelves of the first house he checks (in the beginning of the movie, before he finds the dead body) by running his hand over them. When he finds the dead body hanging, it is very clear that his shock is caused by the doors falling off the hinges, not the sight of the dead person. He even feels the body before being sure of what he is dealing with, since he can't see anything. Just before finding the doors hiding the dead body, he runs into an end table with his thigh, as if he didn't see it. As he walks along the highway with Solara, he silences her so that he can hear the bird (\"dinner\") flying above them. At George and Martha's house, he kicks forward by the first step of the stairs to the porch with his boot so he knows where it is. He never fires his weapon first, needing to hear the sound of shooting at him to identify the location of his target, hence the reason he simply walks away after the last man puts his pistol down after the shoot-out. His use of a shotgun as a primary weapon means that accuracy is not as critical, allowing for him to aim via sound rather than sight. When Eli and Solara approach the cannibals' (George and Martha's) house. As they approach the steps, you can hear a brief clicking sound. Eli is using echolocation to \"see\" what is ahead of him. When paying for his trickle charge, he opens a Zippo lighter and passes his hand over the flame to ensure it indeed was lit instead of seeing the flame. when George says to them, \"No trespassing, didn't you see the sign?\", Eli says, \"Sorry, I didn't see it\"; says to Solara, \"I walk by faith, not by sight\"; in one scene, Eli walks to the edge of an overpass that has a piece missing in the middle, unlike a sighted person who would have realized it was impassable and found a different way around; the Bible, of course, was in Braille; he appears to have a heightened sense of smell; and perhaps most significantly, at the end, when he starts quoting the Bible, the camera moves in slowly towards his face, zooms in on his eyes and we see that his eyes are slightly \"clouded over\" (This was more evident in the theatrical run of the movie on the big screen.)On the flip side, Eli seems to function far too much like someone who can see, being able to shoot a bird out of the sky with a bow and arrow, being able to take on half a dozen people at once in a brawl, being able to pick off people from 50 yards away with a pistol and so on. He also sees Martha's (the cannibal woman) hands shaking and suggests he and Solara leave immediately (though he could have just heard the cup and saucer rattling in her hands). So he's either fully sighted, or perhaps he can see things farther away but not up close, hence his need to read in Braille. So the possibilities are as follow: Eli is blind and if so, he either trained himself to be able to travel, hunt, shoot, etc. like a sighted person would, or perhaps God is guiding his every move, as Eli says, \"I know I wouldn't have made it this far without help\"; Eli is partially blind; or he is fully sighted and anything to suggest otherwise is just a coincidence.",
            "He arrives back at his base with the Bible, when he finally gets it opened, he is mortified to find out that it is printed in braille. He tries to compel Claudia to read it for him but she states that she doesn't remember how to read braille. She then reveals to him that she could smell his wounded leg and that it was turning gangrenous, he wouldn't live too much longer and also, Carnegie lost all but two or three men in pursuit of Eli and so the townspeople took over. So Carnegie lost everything, and that would soon include his life, for nothing."

            "It's extremely unlikely. Considering that he's sustained two injuries from gunfire and how far he falls and the way he lands on the water-his back hits the water flat-he'd have died from massive internal injuries. Hitting the surface of water is only slightly less forceful than hitting solid ground-water is a fluid but still very dense. The bridge used in the scene is called the Varda Viaduct. The height from the top of the span to the river below is 322 feet (98.15 meters), with a few extra feet (or an extra meter) for the height of the train car he fell from. A fall like that would kill any normal human being. But this is James Bond, and one of the gimmicks of the character has always been his invincibility and his ability to survive deadly situations.",
            "If a viewer is unaware that \"Skyfall\" is the name of the Bond family estate in Scotland, they will probably assume that Bond ended the session because he was tired of the test. Once they learn about the Skyfall estate, they most often conclude that the feeling he had for the place was still strong and that he didn't want to be reminded of it. Skyfall itself is in a remote area of Scotland and was probably a pretty depressing place to grow up, so it would have sad memories for Bond himself.",
            "Yes. Silva's goal was to confront M face-to-face and then to kill her personally. The opening attack on MI6 was intended to force security protocols, driving the operations underground into the World War II cabinet bunkers and war tunnels. It is clear that Silva intended to be captured and held, as the laptop they seized from him was programmed with maps of London's subterranean tunnel systems, and was set to open all the doors when Q attached it to the MI6 network in order to decrypt it. In the scene where Silva is introduced, he brags about being a better agent than Bond, and speaks of his ability to \"choose his own secret missions\". Then, when leaving London to drive to Scotland, Bond concedes to M that Silva has been a step ahead the whole time. It is clear that his capture was part of his master plan.",
            "The front of the train reads \"Not in service\" indicating that the train is inactive at the time. Silva was using the train to cover his escape from the chamber; he probably didn't intend for the train to kill Bond, it was probably meant to stay lodged in the chamber to thwart anyone who came after him. However, Bond was a bit faster in catching up to Silva, so he witnessed Silva setting off the explosion. If Bond had been crushed by the train, it would've been a bonus in his plan.",
            "M and Bond know that Silva only wants M and that while in London she is more vulnerable. More importantly, though, there is likely to be more destruction among the public and more civilians will be killed as a byproduct of that destruction as well as reputations ruined at MI6-or further ruined, given the story up to that point. M and Bond come up with the plan to make Silva chase them to a remote area to avoid anyone else being involved or hurt in what was essentially a personal confrontation between M and Silva. M and Bond's ultimate goal is to settle things with Silva regardless of outcome with as little notice or damage to anyone outside the conflict as possible. The Skyfall lodge provided a remote, uninhabited area for a final showdown as well as a place that Bond was familiar with which would give him the upper hand against Silva and his men. Plus, the lodge is in the middle of a very large, flat, open plain, making it easier to see anyone approaching. Another reason that they do not bring any backup from MI6 is simply that MI6 would never endorse or agree to their plan which is why they go rogue. M is already being investigated by the British government for failed missions, and the likelihood of their getting approval for MI6 assistance in a new mission to stop Silva is impossible. This is also why Q and Mallory indicate reluctance to help them even from afar as their careers would be jeopardized if their role in the plan were discovered. The lack of weapons is explained when Bond asks Kincade where all the guns that used to be at the house are after he finds the empty gun cases where Bond's father's gun collection used to be. Kincade reveals that upon the false news of Bond's death, nearly all of the guns were sold off to other collectors. Bond had been counting on there being more weapons at the house as he could not get any from MI6 as he was operating against their wishes. M even states, after she and Bond begin to drive away from the courthouse, that too many people have suffered because of Silva's vendetta, indicating she just wants it to be over by any means necessary and at as little expense as possible. From a production standpoint, the producers and writers probably wanted to see Bond return to a survival situation where he'd have to rely on his training, intelligence and ability to out-strategize his enemy instead of relying on fancy guns and gadgets. The only \"gadget\" he uses in the final battle are the machine guns housed in the Aston-Martin, and, even then, it required strategy to use them along with all the improvised weapons the three came up with. In the end the strategy works, though it happens at a great cost.",
            "There is a scene as Bond and M are driving away from the city where Bond calls Q and asks him to leave a sort of digital trail of crumbs for Silva to find, so he will know to look for them there. Mallory catches Q doing it and approves despite the fact that it runs contrary to standard MI6 operating procedure.",
            "No. He fires the flare to so that he can see the hole in the ice to escape. Being thick enough to hold a person's weight, it would be virtually impossible to break through by hand from beneath. The hole is there, though somewhat hard to spot. The trick divers and other people who might find themselves disoriented is for knowing which way it is to the surface is to watch bubbles from your exhalations. Whatever direction they travel in is where you find the surface. Bond would likely have gone through scuba training to be an agent and would definitely know that trick, so the flare was just to find the hole in the ice. Close inspection of the scene where the flare travels upward (or perhaps doing a freeze-frame at that moment) reveals the hole in the ice-it's slightly difficult to spot, but it's there.",
            "Bond sends M and Kincaid (Albert Finney) through the tunnel to the chapel while he stays behind to hold off Silva and his lackeys. Heavy machine gun fire from Silva's helicopter and grenades thrown by Silva into the house serve to blow up most of the estate, but Bond manages to blow up two gas canisters with dynamite and take out the helicopter and all but Silva and two of his henchmen before escaping into the tunnel. Silva notices Kincade's flashlight in the distance and heads towards it. While crossing a frozen pond, Bond takes out Silva's remaining two henchmen and arrives at the chapel to find Silva head to head with M, pleading with her to shoot them both at the same time. Bond throws a knife into Silva's back, killing him. It's then that M reveals she has been shot in the abdomen. She dies in Bond's arms. Days later, Bond is back in London, contemplating the rooftops. He is joined by Eve, who hands him a small box that M left for him. He opens it to find the white china bulldog and smiles. Eve announces that she's taken a desk job and formally introduces herself, revealing that her last name is Moneypenny. In the final scene, Bond enters M's office, which is now the office of Gareth Mallory, the new M. He hands Bond an assignment folder and asks whether Bond is ready to go back to work. \"With pleasure,\" Bond replies.",
            "Depends on how you look at it, but for the most part he accomplished the plan he and M set out on. As far as his mission from MI6 goes, Bond did lead them to Silva's hideout and the retrieval of the missing hard drive and thus was successful in that respect. The ending at Skyfall is where things get a bit complicated. Silva's plan is essentially fulfilled: He publicly humiliates the MI6 and manages to kill M in what accounts for a kamikaze mission which fails at the first attempt at the inquiry, but ultimately succeeds at Skyfall. And while Silva dies at Bond's hands before M bleeds to death and he's denied the pleasure of seeing M fall, his plan is, nevertheless, successful. However Bond's goal was to protect M and defeat Silva in a place where no one else would notice or be injured or killed. A confrontation in the city would not only lead to MI6 having to have further involvement and even more fallout from the Silva mess, but also many innocent civilians would end up being caught in the crossfire. He succeeds in killing Silva, but M dies before they can call for help. So, at the end of the day, although Bond is the \"last rat standing\", we can consider that both sides cancelled each other out and the outcome is a tie.",
            "An agent may maintain an emergency cache containing items such as cash, fake documents, weapons etc which they may fall back upon in times of crisis. Equally he may have simply pawned his watch. Later on we see him earning money gambling in the beachfront bar."

            "Quorra (played by the talented Olivia Wilde) is an ISO (a unique race of self-manifested programs). Clu saw ISOs as an imperfection and set to wipe out their entire race. The antagonist succeeded in destroying every last one of the ISOs apart from Quorra as she was saved by Kevin Flynn. He then took her in and went into hiding. For as long as both of them were together, Flynn protected and shared his wisdom with Quorra for the time being before leading into the events of the film.",
            "The exact way isn't fully explained but Quorra had Kevin Flynn's disk when she went through the portal, the very same disk that Clu was after the entire film. Clu wanted Flynn's disk to bring an army of programs to the real world. It is possible that the code on a user's disk is able, with the digitizer laser, to make a program into a flesh and blood human being just as the digitizer makes a human into a digital being. Also consider that Quorra is shown to have DNA (or a similar structure) and that Kevin Flynn believes the ISOs will have immense positive impact on humanity outside of the computer. Quorra is obviously not just a program but has human or humanoid characteristics that allowed her to be transported into the real world along with Sam. They were both within the beam after Sam releases his father's disk to transport himself back to the real world. Sam obviously is able to return; it is implied that Quorra is human enough to do so as well.",
            "Kevin created C.L.U. in order to help him make \"the perfect world\". When he reveals to C.L.U that the perfect world can't be created, C.L.U. no longer has a purpose. For C.L.U., a \"perfect world\" represents a world where everything has a goal, a purpose. If the perfect world cannot be created, C.L.U. becomes a useless program and therefore has no purpose. It may also be that C.L.U. feels that Flynn lied to him or betrayed him by giving him a directive that could never be fulfilled.",
            "Flynn, Sam and Quorra head towards the portal they are cut off by CLU. CLU then attacks Flynn and so Sam attempts to fight CLU but Quorra comes between them. Flynn tells CLU to remember what he came for (Flynn's user disk) and so CLU turns his attention back to Flynn, allowing Quorra and Sam to head for the portal. CLU takes Flynn's user disk and finds that Flynn switched his with Quorra's. CLU tries one last-ditch effort to enter the portal but Flynn pulls him back and then Flynn destroys CLU, CLU's war ship and army along with it and presumably himself. On the outside world, Sam takes a flash drive out of the machine and put it on a chain around his neck. It wasn't exactly clear what this was but we can assume he had backed up the system on this drive. As he goes to leave the arcade. Alan Bradley is waiting for him. Sam tells Alan that he is making Alan CEO of Encom and that Sam is taking control of the company. Lastly, Sam walks outside where Quorra is waiting for him. Sam says he wants to show her something, so he takes her for a ride to the city as she takes in the world before her eyes.",
            "It's possible but not very likely. He sacrifices himself to save Kevin, Sam and Quorra, crashes into the ocean, and is seen sinking to the depths. The last we see is his red suit become the blueish white of the users. Because we never see him de-rez, he most likely has survived. Since these movies are called Tron, it's likely the title character will be around for the third outing.",
            "Since he was in the computer world when he supposedly died, it is really not known. The movies have never explored what would happen if a digitized human died in the computer. If Jeff Bridges decides to come back for the sequel, they will most likely think of a creative way to bring him back or explain that he was never dead to begin with. It's also entirely possible that Kevin Flynn will come back in another form in the computer totally unrelated to his digitized form."

He then wonders whether something might have boarded the Elysium while in flight, but Nadia thinks that the creatures may have been with them all along. And she is right. As the movie progresses, it is learned that eight years into the mission, crew member Cpl Gallo (Cam Gigandet) succumbed to pandorum, killed his copilots, and then began screwing with the systems, waking up various passengers to either kill them or exile those who had \"behaved\" into the cargo hold to to play his game, which involved them hanging each other from ropes and feeding on their own. Over the course of 923 years, the descendants of the cannibals adapted to the conditions on the ship becoming troglofaunal (cave-dwelling) and continuing Gallo's game as tradition.",
            "It's implied through Gallo's rant that he wanted to create a \"new world\" in a wild and primitive state where \"life eats life\" (alluding to cannibalism), seemly because he believes that aspects of civilization such as moralistic altruism led to the overpopulation crisis on Earth, judging from his line \"they fucked up our planet\". He could be referencing the way predators keep population growth in check in the wild. In the script, it's stated that he created the hunters on purpose.",

His memory having returned, Bower confronts Payton, asking who he really is, and Payton reveals his true name: Cpl Gallo. The flight log reveals that 923 years have passed since they left earth, and Bower asks where they are. Payton/Gallo opens the viewing roof to reveal complete darkness-no light, no stars, nothing. \"You tell me,\" Gallo says. While Gallo tries to force Bower into joining in his vision of the \"new world,\" Nadia notices diaphenous, jellyfish-like creatures swimming by, and they realize that they've already made an underwater landing on Tanis. Gallo takes the opportunity to attack Bower again, and Nadia fights him off but Gallo overpowers her. Meanwhile, Bower's ODS causes him to hallucinate creatures breaking through onto the bridge, and he shoots at them. A piece of the compartment breaks away and hits the viewing screen causing it to crack. Realizing that they are about to be deluged by water, Bower grabs Nadia, stuffs them both into his pod, and ejects it. The pod is filling with water, so he gives his air mask to Nadia and holds his breath as they rise to the surface. Meanwhile, the Elysium senses the hull breach and begins ejecting the 1,211 pods still holding live passengers. As he and Nadia float on the water's surface, watching all the other pods popping out of the water, Bower smiles. In the final scene, the camera pans upwards through the clouds until it shows the entire planet of Tanis. A note appears saying: Tanis Year One. Population: 1,213."

In particular, he gets the idea about the Cup of Helga Hufflepuff being in Gringott's when Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham Carter) screams at Hermione after she thought they had entered her vault. For the Diadem, Harry has a vision of Voldemort talking with the Grey Lady (Ravenclaw House Ghost, Helena Ravenclaw (Kelly Macdonald), daughter of Rowena), who he later questions for its location. Concerning Nagini, Voldemort's pet snake, Harry also has a short vision where he finds out Voldemort is very concerned for the animal, leading Harry to the conclusion that Nagini is the last Horcrux.",
            "As it is explained more fully in the book, Harry and Voldemort share a unique bond besides the matching twin cores of their wands. This bond was created by the fact that Voldemort used Harry's blood as part of his rebirth ritual in Goblet of Fire. Harry's blood bears the protective spell of Lily's love that was cast when she sacrificed herself for Harry, which means that Voldemort (unknown to him since he does not understand the magic of love) also bears that protective spell. If someone else were to use the Killing Curse on Harry, yes, Voldemort's accidental Horcrux (Harry) would have been destroyed, but Harry would also die as the curse is intended. But as long as Voldemort shared blood with Harry, then Harry could not be truly killed by Voldemort's Killing Curse-therefore, Voldemort destroyed his own accidental Horcrux, helping to lead to his own ultimate demise. Voldemort destroying the Horcrux was the only chance of Harry being able to \"come back to life\" and lead the final part of the battle that results in the destruction of Nagini (the final Horcrux) and Voldemort's death.",
            "After Neville kills Nagini with the Sword of Gryffindor, thus destroying Voldemort's last Horcrux, Harry and Voldemort begin shooting magic bolts at each other, Harry using his wand and Voldemort using the Elder Wand. Suddenly, the Elder Wand causes Voldemort's killing curse to backfire, and the wand flies out of Voldemort's hand and over to Harry. Voldemort's body begins to disintegrate and turns to dust. Later, as Harry, Ron, and Hermoine walk through the rubble that was once Hogwarts, Harry explains that the reason the Elder Wand didn't work for Voldemort was because it actually belonged to Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton), who was the one to disarm Dumbledore before Snape killed him. Then, when Harry disarmed Draco at Malfoy Manor, Harry became the true master of the wand. When Ron enthusiastically points out that they're now invincible, Harry snaps the wand in two and tosses it into the chasm. Nineteen years past. Harry and Ginny are back on the platform, escorting their son, Albus Severus (Arthur Bowen), to platform 9\u00be. where Draco and his wife are sending off their son, and Ron and Hermoine are saying goodbye to their daughter before sending them off to Hogwarts, too. Albus expresses concern that he may be sorted into Slytherin House, but Harry assures him that Severus Snape, once the head of Syltherin, was the bravest man he ever knew. Harry also assures him that, should he wish to be assigned to Gryffindor House, the sorting hat will take that into account. In the final scene, the train pulls out of the station, while Harry, Ginny, Ron, and Hermoine, smiling proudly, wave goodbye to their children.",
            "The movie opens with Voldemort stealing the Elder Wand, which occurs in the book right after Harry's talk with Ollivander. Once Harry determines that there is probably a Horcux in Bellatrix Lestrange's vault, the film immediately cuts to them executing their raid. In the book they spend about a month planning out every detail. Bill Weasley also warns them not to trust Griphook, as Goblins still consider themselves master of the Griffindor sword, even though they had sold it to the wizards. In the book, both Luna Lovegood and Dean Thomas were rescued from Malfoy Manor, and are apparated to safety along with Ollivander before the trio sets out. Also during this time, Remus Lupin (with whom Harry had had a major rift earlier in the book) arrives and announces the birth of his son Teddy (to whom he refers later in the book and film). He asks Harry to be Teddy's godfather, which Harry accepts.The raid on Gringotts happens largely as it does in the book, although with less danger or threat than the book gives this sequence (e.g. the duplicating artifacts in the Vault are also extremely hot). This film, like the others (except Goblet of Fire) differs in its portrayal of Polyjuice Potion, in that the user's voice (Hermione in this case) remains unchanged.Instead of also relying on the memories Dumbledore had shown him to identify Horcruxes (in the book), Harry fully discovers through his connection with Voldemort's mind what they are and where they are hidden in the movie. In the book, Harry witnesses how Voldemort is checking up on all his previous Horcruxes, since he cannot sense their destruction, and finds most of them missing (in the movie, Voldemort instantly feels it when his soul fragments are destroyed, and it temporarily weakens him).When they meet Aberforth in the book, he confronts the Death Eaters pursuing them and tricks them into thinking they were pursuing a false alarm. The mirror fragment that Harry carries around is from one mirror that he received from Sirius in Order of the Phoenix; its twin mirror is found in Aberforth's hide-out. In the movie, there is only one mirror. Aberforth goes into depth about his troublesome past with Albus: their sister Ariana was once assaulted by three Muggle boys, and from the trauma, she became unable to control her magic. Their father killed the Muggles in revenge and spent the rest of his life in Azkaban. Then their mother was accidentally killed during one of Ariana's fits of rage, forcing Albus to abandon his career and care for his sister as Aberforth attended Hogwarts. During one summer, Albus formed a friendship with Grindelwald, and together they dreamt of a world where wizards dominated over Muggles for the greater good, and they obsessed over the Deadly Hallows. One night, this led to a heated argument with Aberforth, culminating in a duel where a stray Killing Curse killed Ariana.While searching for the Ravenclaw diadem, Harry is discovered by Alecto Carrow, who, before getting stunned, immediately warns Voldemort through her Dark Mark. In the ensueing chaos, Amycus is incapacitated as well. While Harry follows Professor McGonagall under his Invisibility Cloak, she is confronted by Snape in a hallway, leading to a fierce duel, with Snape jumping out of a window, clinging to a bat-like creature (in the movie, Snape summons all students to the Great Hall, trying to coerce the students into betraying Harry. Harry himself confronts Snape, but McGonagall fights him off, after which Snape Disapparates). Harry first asks professor Flitwick about the diadem, who has no clue, then Nearly Headless Nick (who hasn't appeared in the films since the second), who sends him to Helena Ravenclaw. Helena admits to be the daughter of Rowena Ravenclaw (one of Hogwart's founders). She had once stolen her mother's diadem and hid it; the Bloody Baron (Slytherin's house ghost) was send to retrieve both Helena and the diadem, but when she refused, the Baron killed her and himself in remorse, becoming ghosts.Ron and Hermione destroying the Hufflepuff Cup is shown in the movie but only recounted in the book; Hermione kisses Ron afterwards, after Ron suggests that he should help the House Elves. Malfoy enters the Room of Requirement with Crabbe and Goyle, and it is Crabbe who dies. The Fiendfire in the Room is enough to destroy the Horcrux (in the movie it requires another stab with the Basilisk fang).Professor McGonnagall's giggle about always having wanted to use \"Piertotum Locomotor\" (awakening the statues, suits of armor, etc., to defend the school) is a movie invention not in the book.Snape is killed in the Shrieking Shack-in which he has some significant personal history-rather than the boathouse, which was an environment that appears exclusively in the film.Snape's memories are far more expansive in the book, and include excerpts from Snape's life at Hogwarts and friendship with Lily; however, the friendship ends abruptly, due to Snape's grudge against James Potter and his own affiliation with the Death Eaters. There are several memories proving Snape's allegiance to Dumbledore: spying on Professor Quirrel and Durmstrang Headmaster Karkaroff, plotting with Dumbledore's portrait in the Headmaster's office, secretly helping Harry obtaining the Griffindor sword, and his reluctance to promise to kill Dumbledore (which Harry semi-witnessed in the film and Hagrid in the book of Half-Blood Prince). It also shows how Snape tried to prevent harm to George Weasley on the night that the Order of the Phoenix escorted Harry back to the Burrow, but inadvertantly cursed his ear off. However, the scene where a heart-broken Snape finds Lily and James killed by Voldemort was conceived especially for the film and is not in the book.The scope of the Battle of Hogwarts has been expanded in the movie to include viewpoints besides Harry's. Fred Weasley's death is actually shown in the book, though that of Lupin and Tonks is not. In the book, the Death Eaters are joined by many other creatures, such as spiders and Giants.Harry's conversation with Dumbledore clears up some mysteries: Harry can come back from limbo due to the protection provided by his mother's blood: when Voldemort was resurrected with Harry's blood, that protection fortunately went over to Voldemort's blood as well; as long as Voldemort is alive and nearby, Harry is protected. Also, the reason that Harry's wand was able to fight off Voldemort on its own in the previous movie, is because Harry shares blood and a piece of soul with Voldemort; when their wands connected in Goblet of Fire, Harry's wand learned to sense Voldemort's actions, and could act on its own.Dumbledore goes into detail about his friendship with Grindelwald and their youthful quest for power. Both wanted the Elder Wand to rule over the Wizarding World; he himself wanted the Resurrection Stone to reunite his dead family, whereas Grindelwald only wanted it to raise an army of Inferi. However, Dumbledore clashed with Grindelwald over the issue of Muggles (whom Grindelwald wanted to enslave), and with Aberforth over his intention to find the Invisibility Cloak to hide their sister Ariana, whom he saw as a burden. This caused a heated argument that led to a fierce three-way duel, in which Ariana was hit by a stray Killing Curse. Unsure who fired the fatal curse, a remorseful Dumbledore did not dare to confront Grindelwald for years, out of fear that he might learn that he accidentally killed his own sister. Dumbledore also explains that upon finding out that the black Marvolo ring contained the Resurrection Stone, he immediately put it on, just to see his dead sister once more and ask for her forgiveness; however, he temporarily forgot that it was a Horcrux and carried a lethal curse.Upon returning from death, Voldemort uses the Cruciatus curse on Harry's body to reassure himself that Harry is dead; the curse has no effect on him (not because Harry is dead, but because the Elder Wand will not harm its master). While carrying Harry to Hogwarts, Hagrid scolds the onlooking Centaurs for not interfering.The final confrontation is also different. In the book, upon arriving at Hogwarts, Voldemort punishes Neville for his refusal to join him by cursing him with a Full Body Bind, and putting the burning Sorting Hat on his head. At that point, hordes of wizard families climb over the walls, together with Centaurs, Thestrals, Buckbeak and Grawp, which starts another battle that moves into the castle. In the confusion, Harry escapes and hides under the Invisibility Cloak, while Neville is freed from the curse, takes the Griffindor Sword from the Sorting Hat and immediately decapitates Nagini with it (in the movie, Ron, Hermione and Neville have to chase the snake all the way through the castle during the duel).The book version of the duel does not involve Harry and Voldemort separating from the others and Apparating around the castle, with Harry revealing who the master of the Elder Wand is. Instead, Harry searches for Voldemort under his Cloak, finding that the Death Eaters' curses have little effect on his friends (later explained as a result of his sacrifice; like his mother, Harry gave his life for his friends, and his blood now protects them from harm). He finds Voldemort fighting off many other wizards, and becoming enraged when Bellatrix is killed by Mrs. Weasley. But before he can harm her, Harry reveals himself. He gets to deliver a lengthy speech, in which he both taunts and offers an olive branch to Voldemort: a chance to repent for all his actions, and a warning that the Elder Wand is now under his control (because Draco became its master when he disarmed Dumbledore, and Harry in return became master when he took Draco's wand in Malfoy Manor). More importantly, he reveals that Snape had never been Voldemort's man from the moment he targetted Lily Potter, revealing to all Snape's duplicitous heroic role. Voldemort nevertheless fires the Killing Curse, which immediately rebounds on Harry's Disarming Curse and kills Voldemort, who falls down lifelessly. In the movie, the curses meet again in mid-air, and upon defeat, Voldemort's body completely obliterates.In the book, the Malfoy family has remained in the castle and is sitting uneasily among the victims and the victorious wizards, whereas in the movie, they already left Hogwarts before the last battle. Harry uses the Elder Wand to mend his own wand, and has one last talk with Dumbledore, via his portrait in the Headmaster's office, in which Harry promises not to search for the Resurrection Stone, and to leave the wand in Dumbledore's tomb (rather than destroying it), hoping, as Dumbledore had, to destroy its power by dying without ever being disarmed while in possession of it. In the movie, Harry simply snaps the Elder Wand in two, and throws away the pieces."

            "When Walt confesses, he confesses about the things he felt he did wrong in life. He mentions he didn't pay taxes on an item he bought, which he felt was stealing. He admits he kissed a woman at work Christmas party, while his wife was in the other room. So he felt he was unfaithful to his wife. Lastly, he felt he wasn't a good father and never had a good relationship with his sons.The reason Walt doesn't confess to killing people in Korea is possibly for a few reasons;First, he doesn't feel he needs absolution for this. It was war and he was killing men that tried to kill him or that he was ordered to. The second possibility is that Walt felt he didn't deserve absolution for the people he killed. This is more likely because Walt is clearly remorseful for having killed people and didn't want Thao to follow on the same path.",
            "Angry at how the gang beat and raped Sue (Ahney Her), Thao wants revenge, but Walt tells him to remain calm while they figure out a plan of action. Thao goes home, and Walt goes out for a shave and a haircut. He buys himself a fitted suit and makes his confession with Father Janovich (Christopher Carley). When Thao joins him at 4 p.m. to find out what they're going to do, Walt locks him in the basement. He drops off his dog Daisy at the Vang Lor house, then drives to the home of the gang members. In a loud voice, which causes all the neighbors to peek out their windows, Walt confronts the gang members. He takes out a cigarette and asks for a light. When no one produces one, Walt slowly reaches into his jacket, and withdraws his hand quickly, tricking the gang into thinking he is pulling a gun, so they open fire on him. Walt falls to the ground, revealing a cigarette lighter in his hand. Sue, having been previously alerted by Walt, lets Thao out of the basement, and they drive over to the shooting scene where the police tell them that the gang members will be imprisoned for a long time due to the number of witnesses. The funeral is attended by Walt's family and the Vang Lor clan. At the reading of the will, Walt shocks his greedy family by leaving his house to the church and his Gran Torino to Thao. In the final scene, Thao and Daisy tool along in the Gran Torino.You also have to considered that Walt was dying of a disease and he probably wouldn't had long to live anyways.",
            "For many reasons. Early in the film, Walt is seen coughing up blood and looking at test results/hospital admission forms, which suggests that he is dying from lung cancer. He mentions that he's already got a stained soul and has been wracked with guilt every day for all the people he killed in Korea, including a young boy not dissimilar to Thao. If Thao had come with Walt to the gang's house and successfully exacted revenge, he knew Thao would have their deaths on his conscience, as well as potentially going to prison, which would ruin his life. Or Thao would be killed, for which Walt would also have felt responsible. So, as an old man dying of cancer, he sacrificed himself to preserve Thao's future and to ensure that the gang is sent to prison. In the act of sacrificing himself, Walt gained redemption for his past.",
            "The movie doesn't go into the details of all his possessions, such as his bank account, tools, furniture, etc. The two main points of contention are his home (which his son Mitch (Brian Haley) wants) and his Gran Torino (which his granddaughter Ashley (Dreama Walker) wants). He leaves the house to the Church \"because Dorothy would have liked that\" (and perhaps because he had developed a grudging respect for the padre). He leaves the car to Thao whom he was proud to call his friend. He says in confession that he regretted not being a very good father to his two sons but says he didn't really know how. It is clear throughout the movie that he does not have a good relationship with his actual family."

She takes it to the prison to show the photos to Do-joon who remembers seeing the junkman at the abandoned house where Ah-jung was killed. Mother recognizes him as the man from whom she bought the umbrella and goes out to see him. Posing as a volunteer worker for Hyeminwon, an organization that provides free medical checks for elderly people living alone, she gets the junkman talking about what he saw the night Ah-jung was killed. He describes how Ah-jung was being followed by a boy who accused her of not liking boys, so Ah-jung tossed a heavy rock at him. When Ah-jung calls the boy a \"stupid retard\", the boy threw the rock back at Ah-jung, hitting her in the head and killing her. The boy then carried the body to the roof and left it hanging over the ledge. Mother realizes that he's talking about her son and informs him that the police are going to re-open the investigation and release Do-joon in a few days. When the junkman describes how the boy did this weird thing with his thumbs on his temples and starts to phone the police about what he saw, Mother repeatedly hits him in the head with a large pipe wrench and burns down the house to cover the murder. Days later, Inspector Je-mun (Yun Je-mun) informs Mother that they have caught the killer, Crazy JP escaped from the sanitarium, and that they are going to release Do-joon because they found blood on JP's shirt that matched that of Ah-jung. JP has denied that he killed Ah-jung, claiming that she got a nosebleed on his shirt. Mother requests to meet JP and finds that he is a Down's Syndrome child. When she finds out that JP has no mother (to fight for him), she breaks down and cries, knowing that he is about to go to jail for something he didn't do but has nobody to fight for him. Do-joon is released from prison. On his way back, he meets Jin-tae in his new car and learns that the junk dealer's place burned down. Picking through the rubble, Do-joon finds Mother's acupuncture needle case. He later informs Mother that he thinks JP might have put Ah-jung's body on the roof so that someone would find her and get medical help for her, because she was bleeding. In the final scenes, Mother is going off on a \"Thank You Parents\" bus tour. Do-joon buys her some food to eat and returns her partially-burned acupuncture box. \"How could you leave this lying around?\" he asks Mother. Mother then hurriedly boards the bus. While the rest of the passengers dance in the aisle of the bus, Mother runs an acupuncture needle into her thigh to try and forget what she has done and then starts to dance.",
            "The film does not provide a definitive answer, leaving the audience to ponder four possibilities: (1) Jin-tae (Jin Goo), (2) the junkman, (3) Do-joon, and (4) Crazy JP from the sanitarium. Jin-tae is ruled out early in the movie. The majority of viewers conclude that the junkman's version of the murder is the truthful one. This is actually evidenced when the police make Do-joon demonstrate the events using a dummy, and he clearly shows them how Ah-jung's head was hit with a rock and her body carried to the roof and placed over the ledge for someone to notice it and get medical attention. In the end, it is Ah-jung's blood on Crazy JP's shirt that the police find most suspicious.However, the blood on Crazy JP's shirt is explained earlier in the movie by multiple sources. The film makes it VERY clear that Do-joon is the real killer"

            "As previously stated, the killing of Joe's wife was unintentional. However, it's not impossible to murder people in the future. It's just impossible to get away with it. So it's likely that henchman would have been apprehended and charged for her murder.",
            "Looper indeed has its unique way of looking at the concept of time travel. Many people have praised the way the concept is depicted here, yet they have also indicated that this approach allows for quite a few plot holes.The most obvious ones arise from the fact that the story seems unaffected by so-called time paradoxes. A prime example of this is the final twist: young Joe realizes that old Joe is about to kill Cid's mother Sara, which will be the event that causes Cid to become the feared Rainmaker. So young Joe sacrifices himself, and by killing himself, old Joe also vanishes. Sara lives, Cid never becomes the Rainmaker, and the dark future is prevented. But this immediately causes a paradox: if young Joe is dead, then he can't age to become old Joe. If old Joe doesn't travel back to the past, he can't set in motion most of the events in the movie that cause the finale, including young Joe killing himself. And if young Joe doesn't kill himself, old Joe will be sent back in time, forcing the world to go into an endlessly repeating cycle of events.This is often referred to as the \"Grandfather paradox\", named after the thought experiment where one cannot theoretically go back in time to kill one's grandfather: doing so would prevent you from being born. If you're not born, you can't travel back in time, and thus you can't kill your own grandfather, which, in turn, causes you to be born, travel back and kill your grandfather. In short, a paradox will ensue when one travels back in time, and does something to affect the act of the time travel itself.In an interview, Rian Johnson, director of Looper, has indicated that it was part of an early creative decision to take a linear approach to time, instead of one where there is a constant switch to alternate timelines. This means that time is dealt with on a moment-to-moment basis (\"nothing has happened until it happens\"). In practice, this means that any changes made to the timeline do not retroactively affect the entire timeline; they only take effect from the moment that changes were made \"Everything is kind of being created and fused in terms of the timeline in the present moment; the universe would realize (the change) and catch up with it.\"For example, as soon as young Joe starts to carve messages for old Joe into his arm, Joe receives the scars from this change. Technically, he should have had them even before he was sent back in time. So the timeline is not completely re-written; the change has no effect on the past (before the change), only the future (after the change).In Johnson's own words: \"What's important is what the experience of these people are in the events that happened in the movie. And that, you have to experience in a linear fashion.\" Whether or not this is an accurate depiction of time-travel, it does conveniently negate the effects of time paradoxes."

            "Yes. Angelica drinks from the fountain. As Blackbeard and Angelica are both dying, Jack fills both the chalices with water and puts the tear into one, without revealing which. He then asks Blackbeard to save Angelica by giving up his own life, and seemingly directs him to the chalice without the tear. However, Blackbeard grabs the one that Sparrow had offered to Angelica and drinks from it, demanding instead that Angelica save him. Angelica complies, but Jack, anticipating this, had actually put the tear in the other cup-the one Angelica drinks from. Blackbeard, furious, is swept away by the waters of the fountain and killed.",
            "There are many opinions and thoughts on this question. In the film, it is stated by one of the other sailors that a mermaid's kiss can prevent a man from drowning. If the mermaid attack scene is closely watched you can see that, while teasing/tempting the sailors, not one of those mermaids actually kissed one of the sailors that they pulled overboard to kill. On the other hand, Syrena did kiss Phillip. Furthermore, it was noted by Blackbeard himself that she clearly cared for him, and they used this as a means to get her tear (making her think Phillip was dead and then have a tear of joy at finding him still alive) It was also noted that she was \"different\" and that the entire tone of the end scene at the pond was different from the tone of the mermaid attack scene. Syrena says that she can save Phillip, so it seems likely that is what she is doing, saving him and kisses him beforehand to ensure that he doesn't drown while beneath the water. Other possibilities include: (1) she was taking him to the fountain of youth, but whether a sacrifice is required or merely drinking from the fountain to heal his wounds is unknown, or (2) she turned him into a merman, which is a common theme in mermaid folklore.",
            "Likely not. It was stated that drinking from one chalice takes away all the years you have lived and would live and gives them to the person who drinks from the other chalice. The real Blackbeard was rumoured to be around 35 to 40 at the time of his death. However, assuming Ian McShane was playing the role at his actual age of 69, we can assume that Blackbeard would have died in a short amount of time if he hadn't drunk from the cup regardless. Therefore, Angelica would have received roughly 70 more years onto her life. Whether she would age accordingly or stay young is another question."

            "Firstly, we know that the effects of one level have stronger effects on its next level than any after, which is why Saito feels less pain from his gunshot wounds as he gets deeper. Level 3 is therefore less likely to feel the effects of level 1. Secondly, the dreamers in level 1 (specifically Arthur, as level 2 is Arthur's dream) are feeling a drop which causes level 2 to lose gravity. However, the dreamers in level 2 (specifically Eames, as level 3 is Eames' dream) aren't feeling zero gravity, since they're experiencing a lack of gravity. It's the movement that affects the dreamer not the experience, and thus because the dreamers probably can't feel this weightlessness when they're asleep, it won't affect their dream.",
            "No one has answered this question yet.",
            "In the movie it's said that the whole dream sharing technology was created by military to use dreams to train soldiers. It's easier and safer to create all sorts of scenarios and situations for soldiers to train, and all outcomes vanish once they wake up. Somehow, not explained on the movie, Miles - Mal's father and Cobb's father in law - was involved and taught it to his daughter and Cobb who was his student. Parallel to that they felt in love, married and had children. Away from Miles they kept experimenting, dreaming inside dreams, going deeper and deeper, until they found that \"deeper world\". They then went there and started creating stuff, remaining there for decades. Mal ended up liking it so much that she locked away and forgot the knowledge that it was a dream and then didn't wanna leave it, believing that was reality, while Cobb knew and wanted to go back, but obviously didn't wanna leave her behind. He then discovered her lock and changed it from \"this is reality\" to \"this is a dream and we need to suicide together to wake up\". That made her accept to return, but kept her wanting to suicide with him, which made her plot the suicide and send the letter incriminating him. That made him suspect and he had to flee to not be arrested and leave his kids with their grandmother.",
            "Saito is shot on the first level of the dream, but dies on the third level and enters Limbo minutes before Ariadne leaves Limbo. Therefore, there isn't enough time to find Saito and kick his consciousness back to level 3 for Eames to resuscitate him. Even if they manage to resuscitate him on the third level, the kick on third level would bring him back to the second where he was still dying, and if he survived that, the kick on the second level would still bring him back to the first where he was dying the fastest anyway. In the end, he still goes back to Limbo. Meanwhile, since Fischer was shot on the third level and sent to Limbo, his \"bodies\" on the other two levels were totally fine. Ariadne pushed him off the building in Limbo (level 4) to provide him with a \"kick\" in conjunction with Eames using the defibrillator in level 3 to bring Fischer back to life in order to complete the mission. If she had just shot him again down in Limbo, he would have ended up in Limbo again.",
            "Although no one can prove it one way or another, unless that person is Chris Nolan, it is hard to say. Both theories are possible.Evidence to Reality: If we accept that the entire movie is not a dream, and that Cobb did in fact escape his limbo with Mal, then it is reasonable to believe he also escaped his limbo with Saito. Also, there are simple explanations as to why when he sees his kids again they look much like they did in his dream. For example, he never saw his kids faces so we cannot easily tell if they had aged much from his memory. In addition, the movie never defines the amount of time that has passed since Mal had died and Cobb was banned from the U.S. So the memory of his kids may only be a few months old, therefore it is very possible his kids look pretty much the same in the memories and in the present. In addition, the visual duration of the top spinning is never a trustworthy totem at all, since it is a property of the totem others can observe and recreate. If the top is to be trustworthy at all, it is Cobb's knowledge of how it feels to spin it that convinces him he is awake, not the duration of the spinning, which we can presume will end eventually in the final scene. Visually, there is an obvious difference between the wobbly spinning in the end-scene and the absolutely perfect spin in the safe during limbo, again implying the possibility that the final spin could be natural (though only the feel in Cobb's fingers would know for sure). It is alleged that at the end of the film Cobb's children are wearing different, albeit similar clothing compared to the clothes they wear in Cobb's subconscious. In the opening scene dream, you get a glimpse of Cobb's hand. He's wearing his wedding ring. Now, if you follow the rest of the movie keeping an eye out for this you will notice that he only has the ring on when he's allegedly in a dream. At the end of the movie he isn't wearing the ring. If the ring only appears when he's in a dream and he's not wearing at the end of the film, that could be confirmation that in fact he woke up. The sound of the top falling over is played after the credits indicating that it is indeed \"reality\", but the important part is that Cobb is not looking at it, because as Nolan says, \"He doesn't care.\"Evidence to Dream: It is possible that the entire movie is a dream, and that Cobb never left his own limbo. The children appear the same age as in a previous memory, and in fact, appear to have the same motions and same clothes in the yard before turning around. It suggests to the viewer that this is exactly the same as his memory, and thus he could be still dreaming. How long the top spins is not a good totem, except in that it spinning forever is only possible in the dream world. A short-duration spin is a visual property that someone could easily recreate in a dream. If we trust the spinning top, it must be the exact feel in Cobb's fingers as he spins it that convinces him it is genuine. However, Cobb admits that the totem was originally Mal's totem, suggesting that he adopted it as his totem during limbo, making it impossible for him to know the true feel. In addition, a totem can not prove that you've woken up from your own dream, since you know it's true \"feel\" and thus your subconscious can recreate it properly.Also: This may be a continuity error, but when Arthur comes to get Cobb in Tokyo, they leave the hotel room and go to the roof for the helicopter at night. When they're on the roof, it's day.The \"both theories are true\" conjecture: Movie has two main themes: the first one is that the line between dreams and reality can be imperceptible from the perspective of an individual; the second that an idea can be a parasite which, once incepted/inceived, can take over one's psyche. The ending simply reflects the fact that the idea that killed Mal has now taken over Cobb; he cannot discern whether he is now living in a dream or a reality, and we, the audience, witness that intimately. The gyro in the end falters, but we do not see whether it stops or not. Have we witnessed it stop, the movie would be essentially telling us \"fear not, this is real and a happy end\". Had the shot ended with it spinning, the movie would affirm the other theory. However, the shot as-is wants to ensure us that we do not know and we cannot know, because Cobb doesn't know anymore. The lack of definite answer IS the answer; for the rest of his life Cobb will wonder whether everything around him is real, and the audience is deliberately left with that same question hanging in their heads. Notice that when Cobb is in his \"Memory bank\" with Ariadne, Cobb is looking out the window at his kids, he tells Ariadne that his greatest regret is not being able to alter this moment and see his children's beautiful faces again. That would imply that was Cobb's inception to himself. He finally did what he could never do before and altered the moment in which he saw his children and he sees their faces. Also, why was Miles there? He was living in France yet was waiting at the airport in the States (reason why MIles was there: When Cobb visited Miles it was to give him a gift for his children, i.e. Miles was traveling to see Cobb's children in the near future, and obviously Cobb could and would have made arrangements with Miles when he knew he was coming back to America). Even more confusing, Miles' wife, Mal's mother was taking care of Cobb's children in America yet we never see her at the house at the end . The inception itself could be altering his biggest regrets which spreads to every aspect of his life he winds up needing to alter. Or Mal was right the whole time and he was actually still down one dream level and Mal is alive in reality and Cobb wasn't waking up.Unknown group trapping Cobb explanation: Cobb is the best in consciously dreaming, so he'd not use the spinning top as his token if it wasn't reliable. The whole idea in it is that IRL the top will lose energy and fall, while in a dream it can spin endlessly. When Mal created this technique it meant to help figure if they were dreaming or awake, as when (an untrained) one's asleep he doesn't note he's sleeping. But for thieves, it's used to assure they aren't being manipulated by somebody in a dream. During the movie, for 2 times Cobb tests the top and it shows he's awake, then he goes test it but it falls on the ground and Saito enters the bathroom and he's unable to test it again. Then he, disobeying himself, tells Ariadne how the top works, and then only at the end of the movie he tries it again. In this theory, sometime between the 2nd and the 3rd test he's locked in a dream, by some unknown group. On the 3rd test the architect makes the top fall so he doesn't test it, while the architect still doesn't know how it works. Ariadne is in fact an agent, who seduces Cobb into getting his trust, and then he tells her how the top works. She then goes analysing his psychology deeper and deeper, looking for his weak point. At first she discovers about Mal and it seems she's his weak point, that he wanna lock himself on an eternal dream to live with her, but then she notice he's always rejecting her and that Mal isn't good enough. They go on the whole inception project, which in fact is just a plot to mess with Cobb and make him lost on what's a dream and what's reality, it's all very tricky to take his attention into that and make him even more messed. Until he finally succeeds and is taken to see his children. He then tests the top again, the architect makes it move around to look like it's gonna fall, and he's immediately called attention to his children. During the movie he never allows himself look on their faces because he know that's gonna make him fall, but when he thinks the top stopped he lowers his defences and accept to look at them, and when he sees their faces he finally falls and doesn't even bother to take the top from the desk, because all he can think of is them. But in fact he's still in a dream and trapped.Yet for an inception to work, one must accept it as one's own thought process... so of course Nolan does not give interviews where he says, \"This is a movie where I'm trying to wake people up to the fact that they're dreaming.\"Aside what's above, we can consider one more factor in favour of the thesis that entire movie is Cobb's dream, also the ending: the simple fact that the architect's name - mythological Ariadne - is so unbelievably coincidental with her function in the plot. Let's think about it for a moment - what was the reason for Nolan to give her a name so damn obviously mythologicaly correct? What are the chances - in real life - of finding someone so perfectly named for the job he or she is going to perform? And what's intention for a filmmaker to use THAT level of coincidence in the plot other than to give as a hint of metaphore? The movie's so called \"reality\" is filled with such cliches, popcultural or mythical leads, but Ariadne's name is the most obvious one. So if she is, by Nolan's design a part of the dream - so maybe Cobb's entire story about so called inception is in fact a simple in function, yet complicated in form... a coverup for trauma. In that way the whole movie is in fact a psychological drama presented within a view from the inside of a man's extremely troubled soul.",
            "Cobb says that he and Mal were exploring the theory of a dream-within-a-dream. He wanted to go deeper and deeper and they ended up getting lost in Limbo. It is also implied that the more layers deep you go, the more unstable the dreams become, and that 3 layers deep is needed for inception (more than 3 layers is rarely, if ever, done). Knowing all these facts stated clearly throughout the film, it can be assumed that anything over 3 layers deep could potentially send the dreamer to Limbo. Apparently this is what happened to Cobb and Mal.",
            "Cobb explains that he and Mal escaped Limbo the first time by killing themselves, which is a normal way to wake up from a dream under regular sedation. It was explained that dying while under Yusuf's special heavy sedative would not cause you to wake up, but instead to drop down to Limbo. Once there, it would not be possible to escape by dying until the sedatives have worn off-supposedly dying would simply cause you to reenter Limbo. The inception mission was planned for them to be sedated for about 10 hours in reality, which is about the full duration of the flight. The danger of Limbo was that those 10 hours in the real world would feel like decades in Limbo, so one could easily forget that they were dreaming and not realize that they should try to wake up. Even after the sedatives wore off, if they did not intentionally kill themselves to wake up their mind would be stuck in Limbo, and they'd be in a coma in the real world. When Cobb finds Saito in Limbo at the end, it is implied that they shoot themselves to attempt to wake up. When they wake, the flight is almost over and the dream machine is put away. This indicates that the 10 hours had passed and the sedative had run its course, so dying in Limbo woke them up like normal.",
            "Since Mal is Cobb's projection, if he knows her, then Mal should know her as well.",
            "Cobol Engineering assigned Cobb, Arthur and Nash to steal information about a secret document about Saito's energy expansion plan from Saito's mind. There are two levels of the dream: Dream 1: Saito's secret hideout with his mistress, Dream 2: the palace. Cobb is the Extractor, Nash is the level 1 Dreamer and Architect while Arthur is the Point Man and level 2 Dreamer. Cobb manages to steal the secret document but discovers that Mal has informed Saito about the Extraction. Mal threatens to torture Arthur, so Cobb shoots him to wake him up. The dream collapses since the Dreamer is absent. Saito got hit by crumbling wood and Cobb got a Kick from Nash and they wake up in Saito's secret hideout. Saito reveals that he knew about the Extraction all along and changed vital information on the document but decides to go along and used it as an audition for an Inception mission. He's impressed when he found out he's still dreaming when he feels the floor carpet is made from the wrong material. A kid on the train (reality) informs the team with music by putting headphones on Nash's head. As the timer on the dream machine reaches 0, Arthur wakes from the dream and returns to reality. Arthur then set the machine to wake up Cobb, then Nash. The team aborts the mission, pack up everything and leave. A few minutes later, Saito wakes up.",
            "No. As the timer on the machine is still in countdown, a person can't wake up due to the heavy sedation. For strong sedatives, if the timer in the dream machine didn't expire, you're still back in Limbo, unaware of the fact that you're still in there/the awareness that it's a dream becomes vague. Cobb needs time to find Saito in Limbo, and still retains his awareness that it's a dream. Also, it is stated that in Limbo a person's awareness of the passage of time may not be accurate. Minutes can seem like years and years can seem like minutes.",
            "Mal created the idea of a totem to help figure if one's dreaming or awake. The idea is that when (an untrained) one is asleep he doesn't notice that, so people could be sleeping and think they are in reality. That was even more important when they started exploring dream-inside-dream, as a dream could last weeks, and if they created dream worlds based on memories that makes it even harder to figure. Later, when Cobb started using dream sharing to steal secrets, he taught his partners about totems to avoid them getting locked in a dream by an adversary. And he kept using the totem because he wanted more and more to remain dreaming and was losing reference of what was reality and what wasn't.When they discover Limbo, they stay there for decades, but they still knew they were dreaming. Sometime Mal was liking that place so much that she wanted that to be her reality, so she decided to lock her totem stopped, so that she'd never use it again, and at the same time she was injecting herself the idea \"this is the real world\". She knew it wasn't, but she decided to forget.At some point Cobb decided it was time to wake up, but Mal kept refusing it, insisting that their world was real. Cobb of course wouldn't leave her behind, so he looked around what could be making Mal believe that was real. When he found the lock and the top, he made it spin, so that Mal would believe \"this is a dream\". And then he added the idea that they needed to suicide together to wake up.But, when they were back awake, she kept that idea. She believed reality was just another dream and wanted him to suicide with her in order to \"wake up\".",
            "The evidence strongly suggests that he did. Multiple cast members who worked with Christopher Nolan directly and heard his whole vision of the movie probably ad nauseum, including Michael Caine explicitly, and Dileep Rao implicitly, confirm that the ending is part of reality. The top is heard strongly wobbling, about to tip as the screen cuts to black. Upon the completion of a successful mission with the team, one could either believe that Cobb was able to save Saito and himself from Limbo, reuniting him with his family in reality, or we can believe that he was stuck forever and ever more in his Limbo and had only imagined him saving Saito and reuniting with his family. The latter theory, however, does not match with any characteristics of Limbo presented in the movie. In order for the final scenes with Cobb to be Limbo, he (who knows that Limbo is not real) would have to build an airplane, recreate all his team members, create and populate the entire city of Los Angeles, and then create his children two years older. And also create a Limbo where tops wobble instead of spinning perfectly. Then, he would have to forget it was Limbo and \"wake up\" on the plane he created.",
            "When Ariadne killed herself, the higher levels of the dream still existed and the sedative hadn't worn off yet. When Cobb kills himself, however, those higher levels had already collapsed and the sedative had worn off as well, so the only place Cobb could go when he escaped Limbo was reality.",
            "As in many other aspects of the movie, this is left ambiguous. His father only says \"disappointed\", but not in whom or why.It's very odd that anybody, close to death, would tell his son he was disappointed with him. He could be disappointed with himself on how he raised his son, or with Browning and trying to say that he doesn't want Browning leading the company. Anyway, it's very improbable he'd want his son to break his empire. At maximum he'd want his son to focus on creating his own company and leave the big one being handled by somebody else.What's really relevant here is that many people, when their parents die, worry if their parents are proud of them. By having his father say he's disappointed as his last word before death, regardless of what he meant, Fischer assumes it was meant for him and gets frustrated and even more traumatized. And that was used by Cobb and the team to inject the idea that his father was disappointed that he tried to be like him, as in the meaning that he wanted his son to destroy the company and take his own path into creating his own."

            "Smith (Olivier Schneider) was following Martin, probably ever since Martin left the Adlon Hotel after being discharged from the hospital. He was seen following Martin into the subway, and he later shows up at the hospital where he kills Nurse Gretchen (Eva L\u00f6bau) and tries to kill Martin, who has just undergone another MRI. Some viewers have also suggested that the wristwatch Liz gave Martin may have contained a tracking device.",
            "They were the A-team at Section 15 and no doubt had a close and affectionate working relationship with each other. In several scenes, i.e., on the airplane, in the shower, and at the photography exhibit, they are shown holding hands, kissing, and making love. Some viewers conclude that they had a relationship in real life, others that Liz was only acting in character or that the shower scenes were fabricated by Martin to fill in the gaps after losing his memory.",
            "While Professor Bressler (Sebastian Koch) and Prince Shada (Mido Hamada) circulate among the guests at their dinner party, Liz remotely copies Bressler's data from his laptop and activates the bomb that she and Martin planted three months earlier in the Eisenhower suite. Meanwhile, Martin and Gina sneak into the hotel, but they are immediately apprehended by the security guards. Martin is eventually able to convince them that there is a bomb in Prince Shada's suite, and Herr Strauss (Rainer Bock), the head of hotel security, gives the order to evacuate the entire hotel in five minutes. Realizing that their plan has been thwarted, Liz orders the substitute Martin to kill the target. Martin suddenly realizes that Bressler is the target, not Shada. Shada was simply funding Bressler's research into a new strain of corn that would grow in any climate. Bressler and Shada were planning to donate the formula to the world for free. With Bressler's death and the theft of his research, billions of dollars would fall into the wrong hands. Martin goes looking for Bressler and stops the substitute Martin from assassinating him. Meanwhile, Liz attempts unsuccessfully to deactivate the bomb, since it's no longer needed. The bomb blows up part of the top floor of the hotel and kills Liz. The blast causes Martin's memory to return, and he realizes that he is really an assassin for Section 15 and uses his skill to kill the other Martin. As the police and fire trucks arrive, Martin and Gina leave the building, apparently unnoticed. In the final scene, which occurs 24 hours later, a news report shows Shada and Bressler presenting the corn to the public without patent or copyright costs. Meanwhile, Martin and Gina are shown at the train station where Martin presents her with a passport under the name Claudia Marie Taylor, while he will now be traveling under the name Henry Taylor. They board the train and leave Berlin."

            "Well let's see; he's stabbed in the chin and left bleeding out, the predator stabs him in the back to see if he was alive. Then he's blown to pieces by the booby trap of grenades that Royce planted on him. So yeah. Safe to say he's dead.",
            "Because she didn't know they were being hunted by predators until they found one in the camp site. And that moment wasn't right for an information dump. She tells everyone they had to leave, but they are almost immediately attacked. Once they escape, Royce prompts her to tell them what she knows.",
            "Ignoring the AvP films, some fans consider the new Super Predators weaker than the Classic Predators in the first two films. However, that may just be because there are three of them attacking a small group of humans and the humans wind up successful in the end, whereas the previous films had one Predator that would take out entire groups of people. Let's re-cap...Predator: This Predator met his ultimate fate by way of suicide. He was toying with Dutch and brutally beating on him instead of killing him. Near the end of the fight, the Predator notices a trap that Dutch had set for it. So the Predator proceeds to get careless and doesn't take notice to the large tree trunk that was set as the counter-weight to the original trap, which lands on it, forcing the Predator to activate a bomb on its wrist.Predator 2: This Predator is shot a dozen times, has his arm sliced off, then during the final duel with Harrigan, he believes he has mortally wounded Harrigan and once again, the Predator gets careless and savours the moment before striking the final blow, which presents an opportunity for Harrigan to kill the Predator with its own throwing-disc.Predators: \"Tracker\" is killed after sticking Nikolai in the gut and raising him off the ground with its wrist-blade. Nikolai then lifts up his shirt to reveal he has a claymore strapped to his body and detonates it, killing both of them. The Tracker didn't know Nikolai had a bomb strapped to him and wouldn't be able to survive such a large explosion. \"Falconer\" decides to toy with Hanzo and grants him a blade fight. They both take a few swipes at each other, Falconer then throws Hanzo around like a rag-doll and even starts to taunt him. But in one final charge, Hanzo (somewhat) out-maneuvers and disembowels Falconer with his sword before succumbing to his own mortal wound. \"Classic\" gets in a fight with Berserker which ends in a short amount of time with Berserker beheading Classic, probably to show how much more formidable the Super Predators are compared to the Classic. Also, Classic may have been tied up for some time so he may have been severely weakened and malnourished and he still put up a decent fight. Lastly Berserker is stabbed repeatedly by Stans which seems to have little effect on him, then he gets in a brutal fight with the Classic Predator, then he is blown backwards by a grenade booby-trap. Finally, in a guerrilla fighting style, Royce takes running swings at Berserker with an axe while Berserker's vision is blocked. Eventually Berserker recovers and gets the upper-hand on Royce, proceeding to brutally beat him. Before striking the final blow which would kill Royce, Isabelle shoots Beserker center-mass with her sniper rifle, causing an exit wound which brings Berserker to his knees. Whether Berserker didn't know where Isabelle was before that or thought her of no consequence because she was paralyzed is up to the viewer. But Royce is able to finish the Predator off with his axe thanks to Isabelle's well-placed shot.Bottom line: The ultimate downfall of the Predators seems to be arrogance or carelessness in all the films. The Super Predators are probably even more self-confident, seeing as how they hunt the Classics. All of their deaths in this film are the result of toying with their prey instead of just killing them or not taking into consideration that humans are more agile and can set elaborate traps as well.",
            "The creature came from the cages they find earlier, covered in insects, and is another being that these Predators are also hunting. It is an homage to the original Predator design from the first film (originally played by Jean-Claude Van Damme), before they dropped it, and Stan Winston Studios came in to redesign it as the dreadlocked-sporting hunter we all know today. More information on the original design can be seen in the making-of featurettes on the 2-disc DVD Special Edition of Predator.",
            "The group was trapped in Noland's hideout, in a room quickly filling up with smoke. They had no way to escape the room as Noland had blocked it off. Royce made the calculated effort to alert the predators to their location in the hopes that they would want to set the group free in order to hunt them in the open as opposed to letting them die trapped in a room. Royce's assumption was correct, because the Tracker predator infiltrates the hideout and breaks open the entrance to the room in which they were trapped and then leaves in order to let them escape.",
            "Many people ask why someone who has killed two, maybe three, Predators wouldn't be considered trophy-worthy by the Predators. The behind-the-scenes would probably reveal that Laurence Fishburne's filming time was limited, so they didn't have the time or budget to give him an elaborate exit. In the realm of the film, it could be said that the Predators felt that Noland constantly luring other humans into his hide-out and then killing them to steal their gear is very dishonorable, so they gave him a gruesome and dishonorable death. Another point to go with this theory is the Predators felt that, because he was killing their game, he was ruining their hunt, so they killed him the way they did out of anger rather than punishment. Super Predators don't operate on the \"honor system\" that the Classic Predators do. Trophies may not be their biggest priority (as evidenced by the Special Forces soldier they find after escaping the traps, his chest was blown out but he was left there to rot, his skull and spine intact), so Tracker may simply have dispatched Noland as quickly as possible.",
            "\"You're one ugly motherfucker\", but Russian viewers notice that it translates into English more as \"What a face/snout you have\", which could be an allusion to the former as there's likely not a literal translation for it. Literally it means \"What a face you have\", but he uses a derogatory slang term for face which when used, basically means \"You have a really ugly face.\" It sounds much funnier in Russian. Therefore, it may be considered that he says \"You're one ugly motherfucker\" but that exact phrase probably gets lost in translation to Russian so Nikolai says it as close as possible.",
            "Stans had stolen one of the armored vests that Noland had scavenged. He put it on underneath his jumpsuit, when he is laying on his stomach after he is shot, a close-up of the wound reveals the metal plating.",
            "While Edwin stepping on the bear-trap (or in this case man-trap) was not intentional, he was pretending the wound was worse than it was in order to convince Isabelle to stay behind and help him so he could paralyze her. Later on he is able to walk but still has a bad limp.",
            "If you watch the film closely, you'll see that the Classic Predator activates the ship, puts it on auto-pilot for Royce. When Berserker sees the ship taking off, he simply detonates a bomb, destroying the ship. Berserker is never actually seen \"controlling\" the ship. The likely explanation is that the ship belonged to the Classic Predator's tribe and when the Super Predators captured Classic, they rigged the ship with explosives, either as a booby-trap for potential rescuers of Classic, or in case Classic managed to escape. If the ship had belonged to Berserker, he likely would have just pushed a button to have the ship land again instead of blowing up his only means of getting off the planet.",
            "Edwin uses the toxin he finds on a plant to paralyze Isabelle and then reveals to her that he's in fact a serial killer. He says to her, \"Don't worry, it's not fatal. You'll be able to experience everything.\" There are a few theories on this. Some take this to mean he was planning on raping her before the Predators kill them both. Though other parts of his conversations such as \"back home I was a murderer; a freak. but here amongst the monsters, I'm normal, I like it here, I want to stay\" imply that he was simply going to murder her as he thought the Predators brought him there to hunt with them and be an equal to the Predators themselves. As many serial killers suffer from a \"god complex\", they see themselves being more than human, and people are just \"things\" and insignificant, such as how normal people might see a cockroach. Also, he says to Berserker at the end, \"Help me; I'm one of you!\", which supports this theory, though it's not inconceivable that he was going to rape and kill her. He seemed rather put off when Stans makes a comment about raping women earlier in the film, though this could have just been part of his guise to seem normal (or he may have felt somewhat embarrassed/exposed by the mere mention of the notion).",
            "In order...Rocky: As his parachute did not deploy properly, the soldier died in a high-impact collision with the ground.Cuchillo: After the group is attacked by the Predator-hounds, Cuchillo disappears. They hear him calling for help and find him in a clearing sitting on the ground with his back to them. Royce realizes it's a trap and the group decides to leave him, Isabelle shoots Cuchillo in the back to put him out of his misery. Then his voice is heard saying \"Help me!\" again, revealing that he was dead all along.Mombasa: The group heads into the Predator's campsite. When they find the Classic Predator tied to the monolith, a small projectile hits Mombasa in the abdomen. The small projectile then expands within his body into two spikes that shoot out and impale him from the inside.Noland: After offering the group shelter in his hideout, he tries to kill them by smoke asphyxiation. Royce thwarts this by shooting the hull of the ship and alerting the Predators to their hideout. As Noland makes his escape, he is cornered in the hallway by The Tracker Predator and is vaporized by its shoulder cannon.Nikolai: As the group make their escape through the hallways of the ship, Edwin gets lost and Nikolai goes back to help him. As they exit into the sewers, Nikolai is shot in the back by the Tracker. As Nikolai tries to crawl away, the Predator sticks him in the gut and raises him off the ground. So Nikolai lifts his shirt to reveal a claymore explosive he had strapped to his body and he detonates it, taking the Tracker Predator with him.Stans: Starts dancing around shouting and cheering at Nikolai killing the Predator, he doesn't realize Berserker is standing behind him, and so Berserker shoots him in the back with its shoulder cannon sending him through the air. Assuming Stans is dead, Berserker is about to shoot Royce in the head when Stans, who was playing possum, jumps on Berserker's back and starts stabbing it repeatedly and taunting him. Stans shouts for the others to run, then Berserker throws Stans off and he hits his face on the ground. He looks up from the ground, laughing manically and goading berserk to finish him off. So Berserker rips Stans' spine and skull out while he was still alive.Hanzo: As the group runs through an open field, Hanzo decides to make a stand and signals for the others to keep going. He turns and draws his samurai sword and the Falconer Predator appears in front of him. They have a blade fight which ends with Hanzo managing to disembowel the Falconer Predator, but unfortunately Hanzo was also stabbed in the heart so he dies as well. (Please note that there are fan rumours suggesting that Hanzo's \"mortal\" wound was left slightly ambiguous as he was the only one to not have a definitive death, opening the possibility of bringing him back.)Edwin: Reveals that he is in fact a serial killer, he attempts to kill both Royce and Isabelle in order to stay on the planet. Royce takes Edwin's scalpel from him and sticks it into Edwin's chin. As Edwin begs for his life, Royce assures him that he won't kill him. As the Berserker makes his way to the camp, he finds Edwin laying face down but sees he is still alive, so he turns him over setting off a booby-trap that Royce had set up, killing Edwin and wounding the Berserker Predator.A total of eight of ten humans, and three of three Super Predators.",
            "It's left open to viewers to decide. Two possibilities to consider are as follows. (1) He wasn't, and he lied to seem useful. His knowledge of certain drugs and their effects and body decomposition rates are gained from his being a murderer. The scalpel is just his murder weapon of choice. (2) He is a doctor but is also a serial killer (like Hannibal Lecter, or the film From Hell's version of Jack the Ripper). This one seems more likely as he often speaks in medical terminology and carried a small medical kit on his person. There is also a deleted scene in which he admits he was a doctor and was addicted to prescription meds that resulted in him hallucinating a woman attacking him while he was operating on her. So he stabbed her nine times. While this was obviously a fabricated story and was deleted from the film, it's very possible he was actually a doctor.",
            "It is mentioned by Noland that the Predators study the prey when hunting them on the game reserve and that those who are chosen are all predators, i.e. the human predators in our world. This includes serial killers (often also sexual predators), mass murderers, dangerous criminals, military combat personnel, mercenaries and underworld hit-men, regardless of ethnic group and from any part the world. They put him in there to mix up the group dynamic. Edwin is a manipulative and deceitful serial killer; this would allow the predators to hunt a more diverse type of prey. This is evident in Noland's hideout when he convinces Nikolai to come back and save him at the cost of his own life and also when he shows Royce the pictures of Nikolai's kids claiming they are his."

            "Most likely, he does it because Weyland told him to \"try harder\". Weyland wants to know what the fluid can do, hoping that it could have some kind of \"fountain of youth\" properties. David goes to Holloway and asks him how far he is willing to go to find his answers. Holloway replies he would do whatever it takes, so David takes this as an invitation to experiment with the liquid on Holloway. David probably chooses Holloway to experiment on for several reasons. First, Holloway is probably the least needed member of the crew. He brings no apparent skills or talents to the expedition. Second, Holloway has been consistently insulting and hostile to David throughout the voyage. Not to mention, the crew has made the most significant find in human history and Holloway is upset that he didn't get to speak with them. David seems annoyed that Holloway is seemingly ungrateful for the discovery they have made. So, David decides to use Holloway to make a new discovery; what the black liquid does. We are told that David, as a robot, has no emotions, but his behavior throughout the voyage belies this notion.",
            "Millburn is a biologist. He's interested in lifeforms and the creatures seemed harmless to him. His discovering a new alien species probably outweighed his judgement or his fear. He might have expected the curious-looking creature to hold still or, at worst, run off, since at that point he had no real reason to believe it was hostile. A real-world analogy of this incident is with the Australian wildlife expert Steve Irwin who would regularly touch and pet wild and even dangerous animals such as snakes, sharks and crocodiles, and was killed by a stingray as he was filming a documentary. There is also a deleted scene which may help explain Millburn's actions; in it, the group come across some worm-like creatures in the dirt. Millburn gets extremely excited at the discovery of new life. He immediately runs over to them and starts picking them up and talking to them. He gave no thought to the fact that these creatures may possibly be dangerous. While clearly nervous with the snake creature, it appears he just couldn't help himself from interacting with a new life form.",
            "According to Dr. Anil Biltoo, one of the linguists who helped create the Engineer language, David tells the Engineer \"This man (referring to Weyland) is seeking more life. He believes you can give it to him.\" Biltoo also revealed that there was originally more of a conversation between David and the Engineer, but it was reduced to one line. This scene is available in the special features on the DVD and Blu-ray disc releases.",
            "Other structures, the same as where the Space Jockey/Engineer's ship is concealed, can been seen as they land in the Prometheus on LV-223. David also manages to interact with the ship and its navigation system, making it possible that he was able to view the location of other ships. David can also read the writing of the engineers, which may include information about the other ships.",
            "No, she wasn't. There is no specific purpose for her being one in the film. Janek casually asks her if she's an android, but this was most likely to prompt her into having sex with him because she was always so aloof and businesslike. The evidence that Vickers was human far outweighs any that suggests she was an android, including: (1) she is housed in a separate luxury module with life support (which an android would not need), (2) she spent the journey in cryostasis whereas the android David did not, (3) she was seen doing push-ups in her first scene whereas androids would not require exercises (4) she had sex with Janek, (5) she has strong emotions such as anger, panic, frustration, and exhaustion, as when she displays jealousy at Weyland's remark that David is like a \"son\" to him and when she screams \"No No No!\" just before she is crushed by the falling ship, (6) she refers to Peter Weyland as \"Father\", whereas David does not, and (7) as she evacuates the Prometheus, she is seen frantically putting on the space suit that will supply her with oxygen, which androids do not require.Some viewers suugest that she may be an android and base it on evidence such as (1) she calls Weyland \"Father\" but shows little emotion at his death (though it is made clear their strained relationship is one of resentment), (2) the disparity between her age and his (Weyland would have been in his 60s when she was born though men have been known to father children into old age), (3) she pushes David against the wall with ease (though she is seen doing push-ups in her first scene and is clearly physically fit), (4) the surgery-module in her escape pod was calibrated to only perform surgery on males, suggesting that she doesn't need medical assistance (though the pod was obviously there for her father, not her), and (5) androids can be programmed to act human and to eat human food, as did Ash in Alien and Call in Alien: Resurrection (however that is not proof of anything, either for or against).Alternatively, Vickers could have been programmed in a similar manner to Rachel from Ridley Scott's other science fiction film Blade Runner-designed to pursue a particular agenda but programmed with false memories in order so that she believes she is human. However, there appears to be no narrative reason for doing this and since she is never actually revealed to be an android throughout the entirety of the film, even after her death, it is obvious she never was one.",
            "The med-pod was not for the crew's use. It was kept in the private luxury suite/lifeboat that Meredith Vickers travelled in, and was there presumably for Peter Weyland's use alone. Vickers specifically told Shaw not to touch it and, during their conversation, it is made clear that the med-pod was very expensive and was one of only a few that were made. As Weyland was an old man with failing health, he had good reason (and the financial means) to have one onboard that was programmed solely for his use.",
            "No, Fifield's body becomes mutated by the black liquid but he shouldn't be considered a zombie. When Fifield tries to cut the snake creature off of Millburn's arm, it sprays acidic blood onto his mask. This causes Fifield to stumble and fall face-first into the black liquid that was on the ground which causes him to mutate. His body goes missing until it shows up outside the loading dock of the Prometheus. The crew go to inspect the body, seeing it in a contorted state. Fifield's body stands up, revealing a twisted, mutated head and with superhuman agility, strength and aggression and he begins to kill the crew until finally being run over and torched. It's entirely possible this is what would have happened to Holloway if he didn't get Vickers to kill him.",
            "No, the ship in this movie was found (and later crashed) on the planet LV-223, whereas the derelict ship in Alien was found on LV-426. However, LV-223 and LV-426 are both in the same star system, Zeta\u00b2 Reticuli, as they are both moons orbiting the same ringed gas giant, Calpamos (which can be seen in the sky on several occassions in both Prometheus and Alien). Since the remains of the Engineer found in Prometheus were carbon-dated as some 2,000 years old, and Dallas states that the Space Jockey was there so long it was fossilized, it is assumed they were both from the same era.A possible explanation is that both ships were docked on LV-223 when the initial alien outbreak took place 2,000 years earlier and that Derelict-223 didn't make it off the planet whereas Derelict-426 did. However, the latter didn't get far, as it crashed on the neighoring planetoid LV-426, where it was found by the crew of the Nostromo.Confirmation that the ship crashed on LV-426 prior to the events in Prometheus is in the special features on the Prometheus Blu-ray disc in the Peter Weyland files. It mentions that Weyland's company used long range scans of the area of LV-223 and found a signal coming from LV-426, which is in the same system. This will likely be the same signal the Nostromo crew picked up 30 years later, and how the Company were aware of it beforehand. Other than Weyland, David was the only one that knew about it but was not supposed to reveal the location until \"the time is right.\" Because of this, it wasn't until Alien that Weyland Corporation was able to send a crew to LV-426 with the Ash android to bring back the alien life form."

She wanted John to move on with his life, and by admitting to the murder, she hoped he would stop defending her innocence.One other theory may be that Lara was just actually \"testing\" her husband.

Since paper money is not very dense and won't show up on x-ray, there are several possibilities: (1) they split the money between them and hid it in their carry-on bags, (2) they simply didn't declare it, (3) John previously converted the cash into something like traveler's checks or $1,000 bills (to reduce the volume), or (4) John mailed a check or money order to himself at the address where he would be staying in Caracas.

Meanwhile, the police have confiscated John's trash and are looking for clues as to where he might be headed. They find a ripped up photo of a presidential palace in Haiti and order the flight to Haiti stopped. The plane is searched, but they're not on it. That's because John left that photo to misguide the police. However, John's dad (Brian Dennehy) knows exactly where they're going, having seen the airline tickets to Caracas, Venezuela. He opens an atlas, locates Caracas, and smiles. Detective Quinn (Jason Beghe) returns to the parking garage to look for further clues. In a flashback, it's shown how Lara's boss was hit with a fire extinguisher by a junkie (Alissa Sullivan Haggis), who then ran into Lara, snapping off a button and leaving a blood spot on Lara's back as she tried to get away. Lara then picks up the fire extinguisher (which has rolled next to her car), sets it up against the wall, and drives away, unaware that her boss is lying on the ground. Unfortunately, Lara is seen by a coworker. Quinn notices that it's starting to rain and follows the stream of water to the gutter. He lifts the grating and searches for a button but finds nothing. As he sets the grating back in place, a button falls out of a niche, but he doesn't notice it. Back in Caracas, John and Lara are staying in a small hotel room. Lara climbs into bed with Luke and, for the first time, Luke kisses her. In the final scene, John takes a picture of Luke and Lara together.",
            "No. The flashback at the end of the movie reinforces Lara's story, where it shows her bumping into the actual murderer before entering the parking garage. You can see the button that was torn off when she bumped into her in the sewer, confirming these events."

            "It doesn't contain any actual footage, only audio. What we the audience sees in the movie is the events as they played out 60 some years ago and likely Jack's memories of those events, too. Also this footage is necessary for the audience to understand what had happened to the crew.\nRegarding the recording of the audio after separation of the two modules, in the commentary the movie director and story writer Joseph Kosinski explains that, we hear the last few seconds of transmission before the transmission's abruptly cut off, the recorder is in the sleep module, recording remotely, then cut off right when it, the command module, goes inside, the Tet.",
            "No one has answered this question yet.",
            "First of all, because Julia had to cross a much larger distance than Jack. But there are more factors. When Jack released Julia, he said they would be sent into the orbit of the Earth. At this time both the Tet and the Odyssey are near Jupiter. The ejected segment containing Julia and the rest of the crew in delta sleep was set for course towards Earth. The Tet captured the Odyssey's command module with Jack and Victoria in it, and kept on moving towards Earth at unknown speed. It did not encounter the sleep module with Julia in it, or it simply didn't bother with it. The Tet started producing mass amounts of clones of Jack and Victoria. After it reached Earth, the war took place, with the clones used as soldiers. Society and much of Earth was destroyed as a result, and what remained of humanity went underground. The sleep module may have taken months or years to reach Earth, depending on its speed. Unmanned Earth vessels from the last three decades could make the trip within 6 years, depending on their speed and flightpath. It is therefore plausible that the sleep module did not need the entire 60 years for the trip home, and spent several years or perhaps decades in orbit around Earth; the Tet may have continued to ignore it, or didn't notice it between all the satellites also orbiting the Earth.In the meantime, the remnants of humanity learned of the ejected sleep module still orbiting the planet. Sixty years after the war, they used the remains of the Empire State Building to transmit a landing signal to it, forcing it to crash-land within their territory. Since the module responded quite fast to the signal (within a day after activation), it is likely it was already waiting in orbit rather than just coincidentally arriving at Earth. When Jack flies back to the Tet, it is orbiting the Earth, which is a much shorter voyage than from Earth to Jupiter.",
            "Because it simply cannot understand human nature. The Tet is an artificial life form, which can anticipate human responses to certain extents, but it can never comprehend the emotions behind them. It mistakenly thought it had learned all about humans from studying the data aboard the Odyssey. So when Jack told Tet at the end, \"Because I want to live. I want our species to survive. This is the only way,\" Tet could not read his mind but from Jack's biometrics Tet could tell that he was not lying. So Tet assumed he meant he was resigned to remaining part of a group of \"pet\" humans maintained by Tet along with his new preferred mate (whom Tet would clone as well). Of course, we understand that Jack spoke the truth to gain entry but knew Tet would misunderstand him, not comprehending that Jack was willing to sacrifice himself for the good of mankind.That's why it took Jack Harper and cloned him by the thousands: with no memories of his earlier life, it expected Jack could be programmed to be the perfect weapon to wage its war. By thinking it understood him, it thought it could have absolute control over him. Which was true during the war, when the army of Jacks nearly wiped out humanity. The Tet probably assumed that the remaining people would fear the sight of him forever, and never reach out to any of the Jacks remaining on Earth as caretakers. So the Tet could easily fool Jack into thinking that the humans in disguise were remaining Scavs.Its flaw was that it did not expect Jack to retain one vital memory, one of the love for his wife. It was so deeply rooted in his emotional being that it would resurface in every clone of Jack, given enough time and opportunity (notice that Jack from Tower 52 freezes temporarily at the sight of Julia and has a sudden flashback of the Empire State Building, implying he remembers her and his proposal as well). Even more so, the capacity to love also extends to all things from the Earth, its environment, music and culture. Despite having no memories, Jack still feels that Earth is his home. The Tet did not realize that a love for the Earth is so deeply rooted in humanity that it cannot simply be \"erased\" (according to Victoria from Tower 52, Jack 52 also had a similar desire to stay on Earth).So the flaw in the Tet's plan started to backfire when General Beech (Morgan Freeman) noticed Jack 49 picking up a book, and saw him defending the people in the pods against the drone; this convinced him that despite everything, Jack had retained his humanity. The Tet never knew that Jack was cooperating with the other humans, and didn't expect him to. Even when Jack learned the truth about the Scavs and the Tet, the Tet was convinced Jack was no longer human, and thought it could keep his allegiance by promising him things. Nor did the Tet understand the true meaning of death. It simply thinks that all humans have an instinctive urge to stay alive, and does not calculate that Jack may sacrifice himself for Earth and its people. Even when the Tet seems to suspect something is wrong as Jack proceeds into the object's interior, and suspects he might be lying, it ultimately accepts as true his genuine desire for humanity to survive.As for the Tet not suspecting that Jack may be carrying the drones' missing fuel cells: it had ordered the drones to follow Jack's trail to the humans' secret hide-out, and may have assumed that the drones would wipe out the entire human resistance, along with the fuel cells. Again, since Tet did not expect Jack to work with the humans, it did not know that Jack had helped them defeat the drones and obtained the fuel cells.",
            "The shoulder belt for Jack's weapon was covering his old tower number for the majority of the time that he was at Tower 52. Also, she had no reason to notice it. As far as she was aware, he was the only Jack, and she wouldn't bother to make a conscious effort to notice a number that had never changed before.",
            "It's Elvis of course. \"Bob\" is short for bobble head. It is another link to Jack's humanity, just as the objects in his cabin were. The fact that he calls it \"Bob\" instead of \"Elvis\" is a result from the mandatory memory erase Jack was subjected to, meaning that he doesn't recognize whom the figurine represents."

As for it being a \"big deal\", it would likely have been a shocking revelation that the next head of the Vanger group was a serial killer. And made national headlines.",
            "David Fincher has stated that he was prompted by the original story to make a movie out of the book by Stieg Larsson, and that he has never seen the Swedish movie (which was actually a mini-series). So both movies are essentially adaptations of the same source material, and the American version is therefore technically not a remake of the Swedish version. The US version is actually slightly more faithful to the book, which accounts for most of the differences between both versions (see also the changes between the book and US film). Regardless, since both movies follow the book quite closely, there are much more similarities than discrepancies. Here are the biggest differences...Mikael Blomkvist is sentenced to a few months prison time in the Swedish version. He serves his time after solving the Harriet Vanger case, and uses the time to build a case against Wennerstr\u00f6m. In the US version, Blomkvist is only sentenced to a financial penalty, and Lisbeth already starts compiling evidence against Wennerstr\u00f6m after spying on Mikael. Mikael comes to the Vanger estate under the pretense of writing a biography of Henrik Vanger, not as an investigator. Apart from a considerable financial compensation, Henrik offers Mikael information which he can use to get Wennerstr\u00f6m convicted. After Martin's death at the end, it turns out that Henrik kept files on Wennerstr\u00f6m's embezzling activities during the latter's employment at Vanger's company; however, these are over 30 years old and no longer of much use to Mikael.Mikael himself has several flashbacks to Harriet in the Swedish version; his father had worked for the Vanger company, and his family had visited the Vangers when he was a child; Harriet had once babysat him. In the US version, Henrik Vanger saves the Millennium magazine from bankruptcy with a private funding (also to annoy Wennerstr\u00f6m), much to Mikael's dismay, as he prefers to remain independent. Mikael finds a stray cat which keeps him company while staying on the Vanger estate. The cat is later found on his doorstep, decapitated and its limbs broken, apparently as a warning for Mikael to stop his investigation.Lisbeth is beaten up by several punks, not mugged, in the Swedish version, causing her laptop to become broken. In the US version, she pays Bjurman another visit to scare him off.In the US version, Mikael has several meetings with his daughter, who is getting into religion. It is she who identifies the numbers in Harriet's diary as being Bible quotes. In the Swedish version, Lisbeth encounters the numbers while hacking Mikael's computer; she sends him an anonymous e-mail explaining what the numbers mean. Mikael re-traces the e-mail to find Lisbeth. Later, after enlisting her help, Mikael's cottage is secretly searched by someone while they are away on investigation, prompting Lisbeth to install cameras. (Lisbeth noticed that the pictures on the wall have been slightly rearranged, as she has a photographic memory).The final revelation differs somewhat in both movies. In the Swedish version, Henrik's brother Harald Vanger is briefly suspected to be the killer. Mikael breaks into his house, looking for evidence linking him to the killings, but Harald catches him off guard. Martin enters just in time to prevent Harald from shooting Mikael, taking him to his home. Mikael has no clue yet that Martin is the killer until Martin drugs him with a syringe, while Lisbeth finds out that the last victim was Gottfried's secretary. She identifies Martin as the killer by a distinct black and blue sweater, which he also wore on the day that he frightened Harriet in the parade. In the US version, Mikael pays Harald (who is quite friendly) a visit. Their conversation causes him to find a connection between Martin and the last victim, because Martin and the girl were attending the same school. He goes to Martin's house, armed with a knife, but Martin expects him, forcing him into his torture chamber under threat of a gun, and gasses him unconscious.In the Swedish version, Lisbeth purposely waits for Martin's car to blow up, ignoring his calls for help (it even evokes memories of setting her father on fire). In the US version, Mikael gives Lisbeth permission to kill Martin. She causes him to get off the road and crash against a gas tank, which explodes without her being able to help him.In the Swedish version, Mikael remembers that Anita and Harriet looked very similar when they were young, so the \"last confirmed picture taken of Harriet\" is actually of Anita. Anita had moved to London after Harriet's disappearance, and died of cancer, whereas Harriet secretly moved to Australia', living in exile under Anita's maiden name. In the US version, Mikael doesn't realize until the end that it is Harriet actually living in London, having assumed the identity of her cousin. Anita and her husband had smuggled Harriet out to England, but they died in a car accident later, allowing Harriet to remain in England under her cousin's maiden name.Mikael and Lisbeth have a sexual relationship in both versions. In the Swedish version, Lisbeth makes it clear that sex is the only thing she wants from him, despite Mikael's affections. After Martin's death, Lisbeth departs, leaving a note for Mikael with a clue that Harriet is hiding in Australia. Lisbeth gives Mikael a last visit when he is in jail serving his sentence, where she gives him all the information to get Wennerstr\u00f6m convicted. In the US version, Lisbeth stays with Michael until he has traced Harriet. She seems to warm up to Mikael, but she is disillusioned to find that Mikael finally chooses to be with his boss Erika."

You don't own it and will have to return it later. But that thing has a value. So what you do is, even though you're only borrowing it, you sell it for 100. Now it's gone but remember you still need to return it at a later date. So when you need to return it to the banking institution, you buy it back for a lot less than what you sold it for, say 20. Then you return it. You made 80 profit on something you never owned by selling high and buying back low."

            "Yes. Django searches his body to get Broomhilda's emancipation papers. He then says \"auf wiedersehen\" (a common way of saying goodbye in German and as Schultz explained earlier, it literally means \"until I see you again\"). Schultz's body was dumped in the same area that Django was strung up, likely because the shootout only happened a few hours prior and they didn't want to put Schultz's body with all the overseers that Django killed and would only deal with his body after Calvin and the other overseers were seen to first.",
            "Likely within a day. Before freezers and embalming were commonplace, a funeral was often held as soon as possible, before the body started to rot.",
            "Schultz expressed concern about simply trying to approach Candie to buy Broomhilda from him. Something of a psychological gimmick, Schultz explains it thusly:Schutlz: Let's say you want to buy a horse. You go to the farm, knock on the farmer's door and ask to buy the horse. But the farmer says \"no\".Django: Well I say fuck that farmer. I'm gonna steal that horse.Schutlz: Fair enough. But now you're a horse thief and they hang horse thieves. Not to mention, the horse is returned to its original owner. Instead you walk up to the farmer's door and offer to buy the *farm* and make him an offer so ridiculous he is forced to say \"yes\".The main objective is disguised as a trivial side deal. So, Schultz comes up with an idea that Schultz and Django would pretend to be slavers, Schultz being interested in getting into Mandingo fighting and Django being the Mandingo trainer. The way they would get Candie's attention would be to discuss buying one of his prized Mandingo fighters for $12,000, which at the time was an outrageous amount of money (over $400,000 in 2022). This prompts Calvin Candie to show them his hospitality and take them to his home where Broomhilda is being kept. Knowing that Broomhilda had been owned by Germans and spoke German, Schultz requests the \"pleasure\" of her company. The next evening, when discussing the transaction of the Mandingo fighter for $12,000, Schultz would mention how much he enjoyed conversing in his native German tongue with Broomhilda and request to purchase her as well for a modest sum, the transaction of which could happen immediately. Django and Schultz would then leave with Broomhilda, leaving Candie with the impression that they were going to consult with Schultz's lawyer about securing the funds to purchase the Mandingo fighter and simply never return. Schultz needed to pay for Broomhilda so there was a bill of sale, much like when he \"bought\" Django. His reasoning was, if Django and Schultz simply absconded with Broomhilda, they would be labelled thieves and if caught, would be hanged and Broomhilda would be returned to Candie.",
            "Many people who watch the film may feel that there are far simpler ways to go about the situation. Shortly after the film was released, Quentin Tarantino acknowledged the viewer's questions in an interview; Tarantino stated that Schultz likes to create complicated schemes to go about claiming his bounties. For example, at the beginning of the film, Schultz brings Django into a saloon and chases the bartender out while explicitly telling him to make sure he gets the Sheriff. Not the Marshal, but the Sheriff. Once the Sheriff arrives at the saloon, Schultz promptly executes him in front of the entire town. Next the Marshal arrives and the entire town are pointing their guns at Django and Schultz. Schultz goes outside and explains that the Sheriff was actually living under a false name and was really a wanted criminal. This was a complex and possibly dangerous way of doing it. All he really had to do was go to the Marshal and explain who the Sheriff was beforehand. When it came to buying Broomhilda, Schultz explained that he didn't want to simply offer to buy her from Calvin Candie because Schultz wanted to make sure she was purchased legally (with a bill of sale) and also he didn't want to let Candie be in the position of power. Schultz wanted to pay $300 to save her from Candie. But if they went straight to Candie and said, \"We wish to purchase Broomhilda for $300,\" all Candie had to say was \"Well, she obviously means something special to you...so you'd be willing to pay $1,000, I'm guessing.\" Schultz simply could not let someone as detestable as Calvin Candie get the upper hand on him. This helps explain why Schultz refuses to shake Calvin's hand as well.",
            "Calvin Candie was posturing that he expected to get 5 fights out of a Mandingo fighter before they could retire (or die). D'Artagnan begs with Candie, saying he can't fight anymore. Candie then says he wants back the $500 he paid for him. Naturally nobody there, including D'Artagnan had $500 to spend, nor did they care to. Candie had no intention of actually getting reimbursed, he fully planned on killing D'Artagnan. When Schultz jumped up and exclaimed that he would reimburse Candie for D'Artagnan, Candie immediately became suspicious. \"Why would a man trying to get into Mandingo fighting want to spend $500 on a slave who can barely stand?\" was Candie's line of thinking. Django realized that if Candie or any of his associates saw through the ruse, both he and Schultz could very likely be killed or at very least, be sent away without Broomhilda. This is shortly after Schultz chastised Django for getting too carried away with his character of being a black slaver. So, Django says that Schultz wasn't actually willing to pay for D'Artagnan, he was just trying to get Candie to stop toying with him. Candie then orders his men to sick the dogs on D'Artagnan, who then rip him to shreds. The entire time, Candie stares Django dead in the eyes to see if there would be a crack in Django's fa\u00e7ade. Django manages to keep his composure, but Schultz was noticeably disgusted. Candie says to Django, \"Your boss is a little green around the gills for wanting to get into a sport like nigger-fighting.\" To which Django explains, \"Nah, he's just not used to seeing a man ripped apart by dogs is all.\" Calvin, still suspicious, says, \"But you are used to it?\", and Django says, \"Let's just say I'm a little more used to Americans than he is\", finally diffusing the situation. D'Artagnan was dead either way. Django saw this and so continued with the ruse that he was a black slaver that didn't care about the life of a slave, although he clearly shows some remorse towards D'Artagnan and his fate as soon as Candie returns to his buggy. At the end of the film, he gets revenge for D'Artagnan by bursting into the Trackers' cabin and shouting, \"D'Artagnan motherfuckers!\", before gunning them all down.",
            "Django killed the LeQuint Dickey Mining Co. slavers for a couple of reasons. First and foremost, they were slavers; men who made a living off of torturing, brutalizing and working slaves to death in horrible conditions. Django would have been one of those slaves if he hadn't tricked them. Django manages to talk them into letting him go and giving him a gun by fooling them into thinking that the Smitty Bacall gang was hiding out at Candie Land and that there was a $12,000 bounty on the gang. So, all the LeQuint Dickey group had to do was ride in and kill them and they'd be able to collect the bounty. Django's request was that he be allowed to carry a gun and help kill the Smitty Bacall Gang and receive $500 of the bounty (giving the other three $11,500 to divide among themselves). However, Django and Schultz had already killed all of the members of the gang prior to their visit to Candie Land and the $12,000 was used to purchase Hildi. So, once they arrived at the plantation and found out they had been duped, the LeQuint Dickey employees likely would have just in turn killed Django or at the very least made him pay horribly for his deception. So, Django had the drop on them and killed all three and likely without any remorse, given their profession.",
            "At least 20: Candie, Schultz, and Butch Pooch are shot in the first two rooms. Schultz shoots Candie with his small hidden sleeve pistol, and Schultz gets shot with a shotgun by Butch Pooch. Django then shoots Butch with one of his own pistols before chasing Leonide Moguy into the foyer to shoot him and all of the armed plantation men that attack. In the final shot of the foyer, you can see at least 11 corpses lying around on the floor. That's 14. Also, there are two house slaves who get shot by a group of plantation henchmen coming in the back door, which is 16. A few of the corpses also land outside the front door, and there are at least four corpses there, so that ultimately leads to a final body count of at least 20 people dead by the end of the scene. (Though the one called \"Jesse\" who is shot repeatedly by the front door is still alive by the end of the scene. He may have survived if he didn't die from his wounds.)",
            "Calvin Candie's sister, Lara Lee, was far from innocent. She lived on a plantation and clearly had no issues with how her brother brutalized his slaves and likely had a say in how they were punished as well. She constantly held up her nose above the black race, viewing them as nothing more than inferior, sub-human animals. She also had no hang-ups about prostituting her female slaves to her guests, given how she literally dragged Broomhilda up to Dr. Schultz's room. While some might bring up as proof of Lara's righteousness when Stephen and Calvin show off Broomhilda's whipped back and Lara chastises them, it's actually due to her eating dinner and not wanting to be repulsed by looking at mutilated skin. At the end of the film, she was the one who originally wanted to have Django castrated for the death of Calvin and some of his men, but changed her mind and decided to sell Django to the LeQuint Dickey Mining Company for a slow, brutal, agonizing death, after Stephen subtly suggests it. Not to mention, Lara Lee was making Broomhilda into a \"comfort girl\" for both the Mandingos and the slave wranglers.Despite the fact that Django really didn't \"need\" to shoot Lara Lee, as she was unarmed and posed no imminent threat to him, it's understandable as to why he'd want to take revenge on her."

            "Yes. While rescuing Magneto from the prison, Quicksilver mentions that his mother knew someone with magnetic abilities. It is never directly stated in the film, but it is in the sequel, X-Men: Apocalypse. The comics similarly introduced both characters long before confirming the parentage.",
            "Yes. Viewers of the first trailer for this movie may have seen a quick shots of Rogue, particularly one of her fleeing down a hallway with Iceman and Magneto. However, a few months before the film's release Bryan Singer said that these scenes (along with others of Rogue not seen in the trailer) had been cut. Writer Simon Kinberg explained to The Daily Beast that this scene was a rescue mission that he wrote so that older Xavier and Magneto could have an action scene in the film, since McKellen and Stewart most likely would not play the characters again. Without going into exact detail, Kinberg also explained that the scene may have shown why the Sentinels had the ability to copy mutant powers even though that precise ability would not be found in Mystique's DNA. The scene was cut for pacing purposes and while Kinberg said it was very good he believed it added nothing overall to the story. So in the theatrically released movie, we only see a brief glimpse of Rogue in the good future. However, this led to a lot of backlash from X-Men fans with whom Rogue was still quite a popular character, prompting Singer and Kinberg to reconsider. So, a longer version of the movie was released on Blu-ray disc and DVD the next year, dubbed the \"Rogue Cut\", which had the subplot of Rogue's rescue (along with many other scenes) reinstated.",
            "When we go back to the reformed past, we see a newspaper stating that world leaders are looking for Magneto, but it's not stated alongside that they are looking for Mystique as well. Instead, she's made the headline after saving the president and his cabinet. The actions of Charles Xavier, Wolverine and Beast have probably contributed to this. Firstly, they prevented her from killing Trask during the Paris Peace Negotiations, and due to their intervention, Mystique saved the President by impersonating him and incapacitating Magneto. This action also exposed Trask's duplicitous role. So technically, Mystique hasn't done anything wrong. It's the contrary: she almost comes out as a heroine. It is probable that she is still considered to be dangerous, but her attempts to stop Magneto and kill Trask, as well as her subsequent surrender can be interpreted as a cry of desperation on behalf of the mutant community. So, the cabinet may have decided to let her go after saving them. It also helps that Charles was present He could have advocated her actions and defended her in front of the President as well as giving them some guiding words on mutants and offering his assistance on mutant affairs. Likewise, Magneto was already in prison before the events in the film, and since he didn't take the opportunity to clear his name (instead adding another attempt of terrorism to his record), these actions made his fugitive status far more critical than it already was and made Mystique much less of a target.",
            "When the younger Charles is using Cerebro after a long time, Logan tells him to enter inside his mind and Charles sees what will happen in the future. Charles then sees Logan killing Jean. Likely, when Charles recruits Jean (as shown in The Last Stand) he wouldn't repress the \"Phoenix\" and helps Jean to control it. Thus, she would not lose control like she did and kill neither Scott nor the Professor (meaning he is still in his original body in the end).",
            "As the closing lines in the film state, the future is the outcome of collective choices and moments throughout a lifetime. It was imperative that Raven desisted on the idea of killing Trask, since that choice alone would alter the future drastically: distancing herself from Trask would make it impossible for them to get a hold of her DNA, thwarting the creation of the future Sentinels. Charles knew this and put that view in the forefront, instead of his guilt about knowing that he's tried to control her since they met (which is also a contributing factor to her stubbornness). If he had simply controlled her mind and shut her down, he would have created an endless cycle of her planning a new assassination scheme and him redoubling his efforts to stop it, until she had this realization on her own or Erik successfully killed her, breaking the cycle."

The messages from German weather ships are ideal as they are short and will inevitably contain the word 'weather' and sign off with the customary 'Heil Hitler'. Once the weather messages have been solved this means the cryptographers know they have worked out the correct codes and enigma machine settings for that day and can use them to decrypt all other messages sent during that period.\nAlthough this is depicted as a eureka moment solving the problem at a stroke in reality the Germans would periodically upgrade their communications security creating long periods of Enigma 'blackout', only solved by the capture of further Enigma machines and code books by the Royal Navy.

            "Thranduil probably should not know about Strider, as Aragorn was raised secretly by Lord Elrond in Rivendell after the death of his father Arathorn II. However, Aragorn would have been alive at that time of the Battle of Five Armies; in the continuity of Peter Jackson's Middle-earth films, he would have been in his mid-20s, between 25 and 27 years old (in J.R.R. Tolkien's book-continuity, Aragorn would have been 10 years old at the time of Thorin's quest). It is possible that Thranduil had been acquainted with Arathorn before he died and might have met Aragorn as a young man, or he learned of Aragorn's existence from Lord Elrond. In any case, meeting with Gandalf and witnessing the Battle of the Five Armies may have convinced Thranduil that this was only a prelude to a much greater war, and that the return of Sauron and his forces is unavoidable. Knowing that Aragorn was the last descendant of a long line of kings, and destined to reunite the race of Men, he may have forseen the importance of Aragorn in the future. He therefore urges his son to find and assist Aragorn, and to prepare him for a role he has to play later on. In The Fellowship of the Ring, Legolas and Aragorn indeed seem to have been friends for some while, with Legolas defending Aragorn as Isildur's descendant, and heir to the throne of Gondor."

            "Rey is a scavenger who has spent several years of her life on the planet Jakku, awaiting her family's returning to get her. She is compassionate, respecting life, even that of a droid. However she is willing to defend herself and kill if necessary. She is a skilled fighter, pilot and mechanic. Mid-way through the film, it is revealed that she is incredibly powerful in the Force, even with no apparent training. There are several fan theories about her parentage. The leading theories are that she is: (1) Luke Skywalker's daughter; (2) Obi-Wan Kenobi's granddaughter or perhaps his niece; (3) both a Skywalker and a Kenobi; (4) daughter of Han Solo and Leia Organa, that perhaps Han didn't know about if he left Leia shortly after the conception; (5) a reincarnation of Anakin Skywalker or perhaps even another uniquely immaculately conceived individual, implying messiah; (6) a descendant of Palpatine; (7) [Battlefront II story spoiler] she's the daughter of Iden Versio and Del Meeko; (8) she's the daughter of Ezra Bridger and Sabine Wren [from Star Wars: Rebels]; (9) She is the daughter of Torben and Siv from the novel Phasma (10) none of the above and simply an individual with whom the Force is strong J.J. Abrams said in an interview that \"Rey's parents are not in The Force Awakens\". Which can all but rule out Han, Leia and Luke. However, Abrams may have been speaking in the plural sense, which may not completely rule out the possibility of one of her parents appearing in this film. Also, Abrams has been known to mislead fans in interviews in the hopes of surprising them when the project is released. So Rey's parents could still potentially be anybody.",
            "Snoke is the Supreme Leader of the First Order. He is also a Force user, who has trained Kylo Ren in the ways of the dark side of the Force. Little else is known about Snoke, though his holographic appearance suggests he is quite old with desiccated, severely scarred flesh.In The Rise of Skywalker, it's revealed that Snoke is a genetically manufactured being; essentially Emperor Palpatine's puppet. It's unclear if Snoke was being telepathically controlled by Palpatine or if he had his own agency and was just programmed to carry out Palpatine's will. The latter is more likely.",
            "There a few factors that likely lead to Kylo Ren being weaker by the end of the film.1. He is shot in the side by Chewbacca's bowcaster and was bleeding. Several times throughout the film, Chewie's weapon is shown to be extremely powerful, sending enemies flying in the air and taking out multiple targets with one hit. Kylo isn't sent flying back. In fact, he absorbs the impact and falls to one knee. He is likely using a lot of his concentration and Force powers to remain upright and conscious after taking the hit.2. Kylo had just killed his own father. We have seen throughout the film, that Kylo is conflicted, torn between his family, his past and with the dark side of the Force. While he decided to fully pledge himself to the dark side by committing patricide, it is very likely still weighing heavy on his mind, distracting him.3. It has been established that both Rey and Finn are skilled at hand-to-hand combat. Rey is seen early in the film, taking on two attackers single-handedly, a set of skills she likely learned growing up in solitude on the harsh scavenging planet, Jakku. Finn was raised from birth to become a First Order stormtrooper, and he has been trained in blasters and melee combat accordingly. Finn is also praised by Captain Phasma to have received high marks in combat training and was considered officer material. Also, Finn promptly loses his duel with Ren. Kylo simply toyed with Finn until Finn managed to strike him in the shoulder. At which point Kylo decided to end the fight and defeat Finn.4. Snoke mentions that Kylo's training has yet to be completed, therefore, while skilled, Kylo is not yet a master.",
            "It's interesting to note, when the heroes first arrive at the Resistance base, BB-8 approaches R2 and tries to get him to wake up.

At the end of the film, when the heroes return, R2 powers up, meets BB-8, and together they project the entire map that leads to Luke. Soon after, Rey, Chewie and R2 depart to find Luke. If one looks closely, when the group first goes to the Resistance base, Rey isn't with them, as she was captured by the First Order. At the end, she returns to the base with the rest of the group and that's when R2 powers up. So it's likely he was waiting for her specifically and not the missing piece of the map.",

            "Luke originally lost his hand during his duel with Darth Vader in Episode V, The Empire Strikes Back. At the end of that movie, he received an artificial hand that looked just like his normal one. In Episode VI, Return of the Jedi, Luke was shot in his prosthetic hand. He later covers his hand with a glove, and we can briefly see that the flesh on the hand is damaged (yet the hand apparently still functions normally). However, during Rey's Force vision and later in the final scene of The Force Awakens, Luke clearly has a mechanical hand devoid of flesh. Luke simply never bothered replacing the damaged hand (possibly a reminder of how close he came to turning to the dark side) and the prosthetic flesh on it eventually deteriorated . If you look closely when he takes the lightsaber from Rey at the start of The Last Jedi, you can still see the damage from the blaster bolt on his prosthetic.",
            "Technically, Luke did not take years to learn the ways of the Force either. As the prequel movies showed, a formal Jedi training normally took years, with the apprentice typically entering during early childhood, and finishing after reaching adulthood. However, in Episode IV, A New Hope, Luke is introduced to the Force by Obi-Wan who also gives him a lightsaber. Literally several hours later, Luke already succeeds in deflecting lasers while blindfolded, and he uses the Force to guide his torpedo to its target. When Luke duels with Darth Vader in Episode V, The Empire Strikes Back, he manages himself quite well, even though he only had a reltively short time training with Yoda. A lot of what Luke does seems pretty much self-taught, so apparently, some Jedi apprentices are strong in the Force and adept that they can master the basics much faster than others. It may take additional training by a Jedi Master to reach their full potential, though.Rey is also incredibly powerful in the Force. However, she was able to perform the Jedi mind trick, telekinetically draw an object toward herself, and defeat a powerful Dark Side user, all without any training and barely any knowledge of the Force. It has been suggested that when Kylo Ren reached into Rey's mind to extract the image of the map, he unwittingly allowed her to reach into his mind as well. Therefore, the experience may have given her some knowledge of the Force. It's also possible that Rey already learned these powers, but they were suppressed for a mysterious reason. However, the Force was awakened in her when she took ahold of Luke's lightsaber in Maz Kanata's temple, hence the title of the film. Also, while the Jedi and the Sith were considered extinct, and Rey believed Luke Skywalker to be a myth, the Force was common knowledge, as \"may the Force be with you\" was a common saying. Therefore, it's likely people knew about the abilities to mind-trick and control objects from a distance. So Rey, hearing the stories, decided to make an attempt at it and succeeded.It was also established by Obi-Wan in A New Hope, that the Force will partially control your actions, but will also obey your commands. Throughout the series, it is suggested that the Force is a conscious entity that is always looking for balance. It is therefore not unthinkable that the Force favors certain key players in helping them guide their actions. Rey, remembering what Maz Kanata said, closed her eyes and let it guide her.",

            "This is explained briefly in the scene when Stark heads to the Raft, the prison where the heroes who sided with Captain America are imprisoned. Stark receives a message from his A.I. F.R.I.D.A.Y. stating that some facial prosthetis resembling Bucky Barnes' face was uncovered from Baron Zemo's hideout. This implies Zemo wore a facial mask to look like Bucky Barnes and deliberately walked past security cameras to be identified as Bucky, thus framing Bucky for the explosion.",

            "27 minutes into the movie Reagan, tries to go into the cellar. Lee stops her and forbids her to go in there. Why? The cellar is where he works on the hearing aid and there's message boards and security cams. Apparently she's not allowed in there because of the noise she possibly would make?",
            "When we first see the Abbotts' cellar, it's full of newspaper clippings documenting the arrival of these super-sensitive aliens warning against making any noise whatsoever because of their amazing hearing. But how were these newspapers created? Publishing any media physically - printing paper - is an industry for mass publication and it would have been loud?",
            "Why did the old man scream?",
            "After the baby was born and Krasinski's character has gone out to look for the two older children, why is there a flood of water in the basement where the mom and baby are? It is not raining outside.",
            "When the two kids are at the grain elevator, they initially sink into the grain (which in real life does cause occasional deaths in farm country, when people accidentally fall into grain elevators). So they climb on top of the sheet of metal that has fallen into the grain near them. Then the monster shows up, and they get under the sheet of metal to avoid the monster. Why don't they sink into the grain after they are under the metal sheet?"

            "The best explanation is that they were trying to repopulate the Earth. After major events that have a huge toll on the human population, things like these are necessary so that the human race can survive. Also, they may not have intended to have another child, but if they had sex without contraception, it's likely to happen.",
            "The creatures do not use echolocation, they have very sensitive hearing.",
            "Actor Noah Jupe was 12 when the movie was filmed. Assuming the character he plays, Marcus, is more or less the same age, and considering that the main events of the movie (not considering the prologue) are supposed to take place between 1 and 2 years after the alien invasion, this would have made Marcus about 10 years old when the creatures arrived - plenty of time to adequately develop his verbal language skills.",
            "Sound is something you can use to lure creatures, but there is nothing that can be done to truly trap them or kill them after doing so because of their extremely powerful exoskeleton.This is why the family uses fireworks to lure the creatures away for Blunt's character as she is giving birth, to distract them.",
            "Because she is deaf, and there was stuff that could make noise, and she wouldn't know that. Later on she did not have a choice going down there, but obviously, that proved Lee wrong",
            "Newspaper companies are in the business of being able to print news stories at a moment's notice, sometimes reporting events from less than 1 day ago. The devastation caused by the creatures probably took weeks or months, giving more than enough time for some newspapers to be published before the end. How those papers got to the Abbotts is less clear, considering their town was revealed to have been one of the epicenters according to the second movie, but it is possible that the papers came from a different town they scavenged off-screen.",
