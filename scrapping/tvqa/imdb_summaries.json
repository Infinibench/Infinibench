Rachel is too worried about Emma and wants Ross to knock the door down, leading to a funny argument between the two of them (Ross elaborates how an eagle flew in, landed on the stove and caught fire. The baby jumped to the mighty bird's aid. But the eagle construes this as an act on aggression and has the baby in a death grip, while the apartment fills up with water).

Finally, adoption, if nothing else works.Chandler brings a work colleague, Zack (John Stamos), home and introduces him to Monica as a prospective sperm donor. At first, Monica thinks that Chandler is being ridiculous and refuses to be a part of it, until Zack requests a coaster for his beer, which instantly changes her mind.

David explains to her how he is back from Minsk for good as his reason for going out there in the first place, to achieve Positronic distillation of subatomic particles, is impossible. David is single and is happy to know Phoebe is too. Thrilled, Phoebe is diverted from the party and she goes out with David instead.", "episode_7": "While changing Emma, Ross starts to sing Sir Mix-a-Lot's \"Baby Got Back\", which makes Emma laugh for the first time. Rachel is very jealous to find out that she missed Emma's first laugh, and is not amused to find that Ross was singing a song about \"a guy who likes to have sex with women with giant asses\" to their baby daughter, even though Ross tries to point out that the song \"promotes a healthy...body image.\" Rachel tries many different things to get Emma to laugh, but she realizes that only \"Baby Got Back\" will cause Emma to laugh. At the end of the episode, Ross and Rachel sing a duet of the song and even do some dancing along with it, unaware that the rest of the group is watching them do it.Phoebe is very concerned about meeting Mike's parents for dinner at their home. As they talk about it, Rachel talks about meeting Ross's parents for the first time during which she reveals that Judy said that Rachel was like the daughter she never had, which upsets Monica. With some fashion and conversation tips from Monica and Rachel, Phoebe arrives at the Hannigans wearing a very traditional and conservative outfit that prompts Mike to tell Phoebe that she looks like his mother.Phoebe also begins speaking in a very snobbish accent in an effort to fit in with Mike's rich parents Theodore and Bitsy. Mike encourages her to just be herself, but that produces disastrous results as Phoebe provides details about her life on the street (Mom killed herself, step dad went to prison, got hepatitis, including the fact that a pimp once spat in her mouth), playfully punches Mr. Hannigan in the chest (unaware that he just had surgery), and provides Mrs. Hannigan with far too much information about Mike's sexual behavior (Mike is a gentle lover, and can rattle a headboard like a sailor on leave).Phoebe is so desperate to fit in that she even tries to eat veal despite being a fervent vegetarian. While she is in the bathroom throwing up, Mike's parents drop some not-so-subtle hints about breaking up with Phoebe. Phoebe overhears Mike defending her and telling his parents that he loves Phoebe. Phoebe runs in and tells Mike that she loves him, too. Mike and Phoebe leave, but not before Phoebe tells the Hannigans that she threw up in the coat closet instead of the bathroom.When Joey asks Monica and Chandler how he should invest his money (as opposed to his current system of taping it to the back of his toilet tank), Monica suggests investing in real estate and even tells Joey that her old boyfriend, Richard Burke, is moving out of his apartment. Chandler, who still dislikes and distrusts Richard, tags along with Joey to check out Richard's old apartment.\nWhile there, Chandler sees a videotape with Monica's name on it; he quickly (and Joey slowly) concludes that it is a sex tape. Chandler steals the tape and tries to watch it at home, but is too afraid of what might be on there and instead asks Joey to watch it. At first, it just is a football game, but it quickly switches over to a sex tape. Joey manages to tackle Chandler before he sees too much and tackles Monica when she walks into the room.An insecure Chandler tells Monica that all he can think about is her rolling around in bed with Richard while wearing cowboy boots, but Monica responds that she has never worn cowboy boots. They watch more of the tape and see that, in fact, it is not Monica, which makes Chandler relieved. However, Monica is rather miffed that Richard taped over her.", "episode_8": "It's Thanksgiving Day and Chandler suggests that they use their wedding china for dinner, but Monica is too nervous that something might happen to them. After some persuading, she agrees to use them for dinner, however she still stays very nervous.\nWhile watching the parade on TV, Joey sees the float with the stars of the popular day-time soap Days of our Lives and suddenly remembers that he was supposed to be there. Worried because the producers spoke to him directly telling him not to be late, he decides he has to come up with a really good excuse. The problem is that he is a terrible liar (and for some reason incorporates raccoon into all of his lies).Meanwhile, after having not seen each other for a year, Rachel's other sister, Amy (Christina Applegate), shows up unexpectedly to ask for a hair straightener. It quickly becomes obvious that Amy is a very inconsiderate person. She seems to know nothing about Rachel's baby, Emma, and calls her Emmett thinking she's a boy. She does not recognize Ross, but remembers an old \"geeky\" boyfriend who she describes as Rachel's \"fat friend's brother with that bad Afro\".\nAmy gets a phone call from her boyfriend who tells her that he cannot see her today because his wife has come back into town. Amy, who was looking forward to her Thanksgiving dinner of sushi, is very upset claiming it is \"almost not even worth dating married guys\".Rachel in turn invites her over to Monica's Thanksgiving dinner. While there, Amy manages to insult everyone. She mistakenly believes that Phoebe's name is \"Emma\" and that Emma's name is \"Emily\". She soon decides that it would be incredible if Ross and Rachel died because it would mean she would inherit Emma. They tell her however that they had already planned on giving her to Monica and Chandler. Amy is extremely offended by this and her mood becomes even worse.During dinner, Monica stays extremely hostile for the sake of the plates. She goes to the extent of not giving Joey one of them, convincing him that his less-fancy plate is a \"special plate\" and that whoever gets it \"wins\". Amy continues to complain about not getting Emma. She asks if she will get her if Monica dies, as well. Chandler interrupts saying that he would get her in that case. Ross and Rachel say that Emma would, in fact, go to Jack and Judy Geller if that were the situation. A verbal fight ensues about Chandler thinking it's because he won't be a good enough parent to take care of Emma on his own, even though he \"managed to survive what it is killed the three of you!\" When being asked if the situation was the other way around, they say yes. However, Phoebe claims them to have made a \"lying face\", meaning that if Chandler were to die Monica wouldn't have to give Emma up, upsetting him even more. The rest of the night, Chandler sulks on his own.Meanwhile, the producers of DOOL have left Joey a message asking him why he wasn't at the parade, telling him that everyone is very mad. Phoebe comes up with the lie of \"I had a family emergency\", which Joey decides is perfect. Chandler comes back into the apartment and Ross apologizes. Chandlers accepts that he is probably right about being a single parent, but since he is still offended Ross \"doesn't get to keep Joey\", which somewhat irritates him.Amy, still very mad at Rachel, starts a fight with her. It begins as another verbal argument (Amy is most upset that Rachel gets a 30% discount at Ralf Lauren, and Amy has to pay retail. Rachel corrects her that its a 45% discount), but soon escalates into a full-on fight. Monica tries frantically to put away the wedding china, but one is knocked off the table, anyway. At this point, Chandler intervenes. He tells Rachel and Amy to control themselves and to apologize; he acts much like a father would. Ross commends him for it and tells him that if he, Rachel and Monica die that he can take care of Emma, and Ross gets to have Joey. Monica leaves the apartment to get the pie (only one is left because of Joey) while mourning over her lost plate.Rachel apologizes to Amy and, instead of letting her have Emma, tells her that she can use her Ralph Lauren discount. Amy gets teary eyed and hugs her. Emma begins crying and Chandler, extremely confident in himself, offers to change her. As he pulls the diaper bag off of the chair, he brings the box of wedding china with him, causing them all to break. He exclaims, \"Well what do you know, I guess I'll be the one who dies first\".Later that night, he manages to tape up the box without letting Monica know they are broken. Joey walks in and thanks Phoebe for the lying advice and that the producers \"totally bought it\". Monica wishes the plates a goodbye and Joey lets out \"Oh you told her you broke all the plates, huh?\"", "episode_12": "Rachel and Ross hire Molly (Melissa George), a very hot nanny. Joey's natural instincts go crazy when he sees her, and wants to have sex with her, but Ross and Chandler don't want him to.

Ross says she is off limits, but Joey says that given she is unattainable, makes him wanna have her even more. Ross deputes Chandler to keep Joey away from Molly. Chandler doesn't allow Joey to leave his apartment and Joey is aroused by the challenge of attaining the hot nanny.Mike is disgusted to find a rat in Phoebe's apartment. Phoebe explains that Bob is an occasional visitor to her apartment, whom she puts food out for. Mike says that rats are very unsanitary and that Phoebe needs to get rid of it.\nHe sets up traps all over the place, managing to kill Bob before Phoebe can stop Mike and get him to remove the traps (she wanted to just capture Bob and release him far from the city). Phoebe finds out how Bob, actually a female rat, has had babies, and to make up for her death, she and Mike take care of the babies, even taking them to Rachel's birthday party in Monica's apartment.Rachel still finds her new colleague Gavin immature (he was checking out a colleague's ass and made fun of Rachel for having an affair with Tag) and a big jerk. Gavin introduces Rachel to his mother as his secretary. Rachel decides to take the high road and be nice with him. Monica comes to pick Rachel for her birthday lunch and invites Gavin to her birthday party as Rachel was being nice to Gavin, and didn't know that she was faking it.The party is not really going well, as everyone's home by 9:30 (Joey runs after Molly when she takes Emma back to Ross's apartment. Mike and Phoebe leave to take care of their rat babies).\nRoss and Chandler rush after Joey to stop him from seducing Molly. Molly does pretty well by herself when she introduces the guys to Tabitha, her girlfriend, who comes by to pick her up. Joey believes his favorite fantasy has come true. The Princess, The Stable Boy and the LesbianMike makes Phoebe realizes that soon the 7 rat babies will mate and have hundreds of other babies. Mike convinces Phoebe to let the rats go.

When he does at the balcony, he brings Rachel a scarf, and he explains how he has feelings for her. Rachel's about to start criticizing him all over again, but he surprises her by kissing her. Not thinking that it would bring really tragic consequences, Rachel returns the passionate kiss.

However, she gets Monica to change her mind who starts to sing and is applauded by the mostly male audience because they can see through her shirt (she is not wearing a bra either). Chandler arrives later on and notices it and tries to get her to stop, but Monica decides to continue anyway due to the fact she thinks they still love her up there on stage.Ross tells Chandler about him seeing Rachel kiss Gavin on the balcony after the party and says if she wants to move on then so will he (He talks about how a woman accidentally sat on his hand on the subway, and how a woman from work made eyes at him at the interdepartmental pot luck dinner).

Rachel decides to call in sick from work.\nMeanwhile, Gavin comes over to talk to Rachel about the situation with Ross (and he brings her soup). Rachel says it's fine but makes him hide when she hears someone entering the apartment (thinking it's Ross, but actually turns out to be Emma's nanny, Molly) which shows to Gavin that there is something wrong and that there is something between Ross and Rachel. He tells Rachel to talk to Ross.Meanwhile, a woman named Michelle enters the coffeehouse crying about a recent breakup. Ross makes his move and brings her to his apartment. Rachel comes back in and finds Ross and Michelle together. But Michelle is clearly dumb and not the kind of person Ross goes for. Ross admits it was a rebound (he hadn't even told Michelle that he was a doctor) and he gets Michelle to leave when her dumb comments become too much for Ross to defend..Ross says he saw Rachel kiss Gavin. Rachel says it was a one time thing but Ross mentions how she gave her number to a man at the bar in \"The One With Rachel's Phone Number\". Ross tells how he called her and he put the message in his back pocket, frustrating Rachel for hiding her messages.\nThe two realize that living together while not actually being together isn't working out, so Rachel and Emma move back in with Joey.Meanwhile, Joey gets his eyebrows waxed but it hurts (Joey reacts as if he is in excruciating pain every-time a hair is plucked out) after the first one is plucked so he leaves. Chandler does the other one for him after revealing how he'd get his allowance by plucking the eyebrows out of his dad and co-workers ahead of performances. Chandler uses a combination of ice cubes and Aloe Vera, so there is no pain while plucking. Later, Chandler does Joey's eyelashes.", "episode_2": "Rachel adores a sleeping Emma so much that she, much to Phoebe's protest, wakes her up, which indeed turns out to be a very bad decision: Emma doesn't stop crying. When Emma keeps crying for several hours, it drives not only Rachel, but also Monica and Phoebe crazy. Phoebe exclaims that this is proof that no good can come from having sex with Ross.\nThe problem is surprisingly easily solved: when Monica holds her close to her body and swings her rapidly from side to side as mentioned in the baby care book she had been reading earlier, while chanting \"Bouncy Baby Oh Baby Baby Oh\" Emma stops crying immediately, leading to Monica being hired as the \"official baby crier stopper\" by Rachel.Ross finds out that when Rachel thought Joey was proposing to her she said yes.

Joey's way to solve the conflict, Ross hitting him, only makes things worse: Joey ducks away and Ross breaks his thumb on lamppost that stands behind Joey, to Gunther's (James Michael Tyler) amusement (who still cant believe that Rachel chose to sleep with Ross and then had his baby). Joey tries to show Ross that it's a reflex/natural instinct, but Ross doesn't duck and gets hit again.Ross and Joey have to go to the hospital, where Joey fills in Ross' forms. Ross puts Rachel as his emergency contact, who he describes as his \"roommate\" (Ross says he doesn't want to be just anybody in Rachel's life and she is in a very different place right now), but Joey convinces him that he's so much more to Rachel.\nRoss comes home and wants to start the topic of dating again, but Rachel's too tired of Emma and only wants something else: sleep.Chandler couldn't sleep all night because he was worried about a very important meeting he has to go to at work. The result is that he's very tired and starts to fall asleep during the meeting, resulting in him accepting to run the office in Tulsa, even having to move there.

Chandler protests, telling her that his father embarrassed him a lot as a kid, including when he came to every single one of his swim practices and cheered him on dressed as a different Hollywood starlet, Monica tells him that at least he showed up to every single one and cheered for him. She then packs their bags and tells them they are going to Las Vegas to meet his father.Joey decides to bond with Jake, Phoebe's new boyfriend, so he invites him to the Knicks game, but as Jake reaches down for his agenda (to check if he is free), Joey sees he is wearing women's underwear.

Hesitantly, Chandler turns around to face her. Helena is surprised once she recognizes that it is her son, and a tear rolls down her cheek.

Rather awkwardly, Helena turns to another man and says \"So, you're bald.\" Chandler interrupts and invites her to the wedding, and she tells him that she wouldn't miss it for the world.Joey arrives at Central Perk and shows Phoebe that he stole and is currently wearing Rachel's underwear. She replies by agreeing that he is a man, but is also a bit promiscuous. Joey relishes the feel of silk and also goes into a discussion about how pantyhose feels, but the awkward and uncomfortable look Phoebe gives him lets him know that he went too far. Joey goes to take the underwear off and comes back, telling Phoebe that after this whole ordeal he really needs to be with a woman. He goes to hit on the hot girl sitting behind them, and after telling her he was on Days of our Lives, attempts to pay her bill of $4.50, but when pulling out his wallet, he also pulls out Rachel's underwear.Ross is pulled over, this time by Officer Petty (whom Ross calls Officer Pretty), so he tries to do the same thing as Rachel but fails, and he is given a ticket for driving too slow.

Joey tells Rachel, who gets very excited, claiming that the Soapie is third highest prestigious award in soap operas and so he decides to take her as his date to the awards show. She agrees to go with him.Ross finishes up conducting a lecture at the university and afterwards, tells one of his students Ned Morse (Vince Vieluf) that he failed the midterm. The student tells Ross that he failed because he is in love with Ross, and can't concentrate. This totally freaks out Ross who tells the student that the two of them cannot be in a relationship together, because he is a professor while he is a student, and also because he (Ross) is straight.Back at Central Perk, a guy is checking out Monica, and Phoebe tells her to approach him. Monica tells her that she is engaged, but Phoebe tells her that she should have a backup in case things don't work out with Chandler (Phoebe's example involves Chandler losing his ability to satisfy sexually and so how he would be happy if another man would satisfy her needs). The guy approaches them instead, and Monica informs him that she's engaged. It turns out that he actually wanted to talk with Phoebe, so Monica gets a little embarrassed and leaves.Back at his apartment, Joey is practicing winning the Soapie Award. Rachel enters, and he tells her that he will also be presenting an award. She gives him tips on how to go his 'gracious loser face' if he doesn't win the award.\nAfter her date, Phoebe meets Monica at the restaurant to tell her about the date. After hearing Phoebe talk about the excitement of going on a first date, Monica realizes everything she'd be giving up once she gets married to Chandler. He will be the only one she would get to kiss, sleep with, and so on and will therefore no longer be able to feel the buzz of a new relationship. Later, she realizes that her relationship with Chandler is deep and meaningful, and tells him this. He then tells her to pull his finger, which causes her to have second thoughts. When she goes to Phoebe for advice, Phoebe tells her that she should keep her feelings to herself and not express them towards Chandler. (Phoebe's mother had told Phoebe to never discuss fears or problems with your significant other and to keep them locked up somewhere in your mind). When Monica asks if this is the same mother who had multiple husbands and killed herself when Phoebe was 13, Phoebe realizes her mother was wrong and tells Monica to find Chandler and tell him how she really feels, but also asks whether her mother was wrong about telling her that putting out (having sex) would give her love, which horrifies Monica.At the apartment, when Monica questions Chandler about not sleeping with anyone else ever again, he says he is not worried at all. He is just happy that they will be spending the rest of their lives together and Monica realizes that everything she's giving up will be nothing compared to what she will be getting once they're married, such as buying a house together and having a kid and even a grand kid.At the awards show, Joey (accompanied by Rachel) ends up losing and forgets the 'gracious loser face', instead throwing a mini-tantrum which is caught on camera before he composes himself. When he goes to present an award for Best Returning Actress, the winner Jessica Ashley (Alison Sweeney) doesn't show up and, as he is supposed to accept on her behalf, ends up reading the winners speech he prepared. He intends to keep it, but he agrees to give it back to her after Rachel tells him that one day his talent will win an award which would actually mean something to him. Joey agrees, and takes Rachel to the set of Days to find Jessica Ashley to give her the award. Jessica, however, carelessly tosses the award aside claiming that it isn't a real award and leaves, and so Joey decides to keep the award for himself with Rachel's approval.Ross feels sympathy for failing the student, and decides to change his grade for the better, until he finds out it's just a scam. It turns out that the student has a girlfriend, and had been using the same trick he pulled on Ross with three other teachers. Ross confronts the student, claiming that the student doesn't love him and that he's just using him, but two university professors walk in on the argument.

Joey responds with \"You should get inside my head\". At dinner things start off well, as Melissa asks Phoebe if she has ever been in a sorority to which she responds \"Of course. I was a Thigh Mega Tampon\". Phoebe continues by saying they had to be shut down when Regina Phalange died of alcohol poisoning. Rachel segues into the night she and Melissa kissed, but Melissa appears to have no recollection of it. Phoebe isn't surprised to hear this, but Rachel insists that it happened. Melissa says that \"if [she] thought it happened [she]'d say it\".Throughout the entire dinner Rachel cannot let it go, at the end of the night Rachel confronts Melissa and says she won't let her take the experience away and kisses Melissa again to prove that she can do something crazy. Melissa takes this to mean that Rachel loves her, to the latter's confusion. She confirms the first kiss did happen and she remembers their kiss and that she loves her as well.

Joey says that he told them they were invited because he thought parents were coming (knowing that Monica's, Chandler's and Ross's were coming). He pleads with her to invite them, and she reluctantly agrees. After rearranging the seating chart and ordering two extra meals from the caterer, Joey tells Monica that they won't be going. He says that they think they are unwanted, but asks Monica to call his mom and convince her otherwise. Once again, Monica reluctantly agrees. Later, Joey asks Monica for time to \"vamp\" at the wedding because his parents want to see him officiate, but his niece's christening is on the same day. Monica states that the wedding starts at six, but for another time, reluctantly agrees. When Joey tries to get Monica and Chandler's attention later, she breaks and says that whatever he wants he can have it, even if that included his mother standing \"at the altar screaming racial slurs\". But Joey just thanks them for inviting his parents. He, then, shows them a ridiculous hat his parents got him to wear at the ceremony.At Ralph Lauren, Rachel helps Chandler find a tuxedo for the wedding. She shows him custom-made tuxedos that celebrities have worn to award shows and sent back. Chandler finds one worn by Pierce Brosnan and insists that he has to \"get married in James Bond's tux\". Chandler thinks he is the coolest until he learns that Rachel also found Ross a tux worn by Val Kilmer in Batman Forever. Chandler asks Ross not to wear it because he is supposed to wear the famous tux and that if Ross wears Batman's tux, it will make his less special. Ross declines, insisting on wearing the tux. When Chandler tries on his tux, he discovers that the jacket is way too large and the pants are way too small. There is no way he can wear it. He, then tries on Ross's tux and it fits perfectly.

The gang believe the Ross was the one who initiated it but Ross is determined to prove that it was Rachel. To the shock of everyone, he accidentally reveals that he has the encounter on videotape. Rachel is disgusted and goes back to her and Joey's apartment and locks the door. Everyone else instantly thinks that he is a pervert until he explains that it was unintentional. Ross explains that on the day he and Rachel hooked up, he had a date but revealed to Joey that he hadn't had sex in six months. Joey confirms the story after forcing Ross to say the embarrassing statement. The scene then flips to a flashback from six weeks earlier.After hearing Ross' problem, Joey tells him about the \"Europe story\", a made up story which apparently makes anyone who hears it want to have sex with the person who is telling it. Ross tries it on his date, but she keeps interrupting him as he cannot hold her attention. Joey suggests that Ross videotape himself to see how he can improve. Ross does so and Rachel comes in, revealing she forgot to send Monica and Chandler's wedding invitations. Seeing Rachel, Ross goes over to help her while forgetting that the camera is still on and thus recorded everything. Back in the present, the gang agree with Ross that the filming was unintentional, but all agree that they should see the tape, much to Ross' chagrin.Meanwhile, Monica and Chandler had met another couple on their honeymoon, saying that they hit it off right away (because Chandler was so funny with his jokes and Monica had some great, insightful questions), but discover the number they had been given was not their actual number.

As Rachel sets the tape on the floor and is about to step on it, the rest of gang protest, wanting to watch the tape to solve the issue of who came onto whom (minus the two of them having sex). However, as Ross tells them that Rachel is going to destroy the tape, she surprises him by saying she wants to see it too, at least just to prove him wrong about their encounter. As they watch, Rachel gloats that they're about to see Ross come on to her by kissing her, but then they see that Rachel used the \"Europe story\" on Ross, proving that she was the one who initiated it. The gang calls her out on it and Rachel is shocked that they all know about the story. She says indignantly she heard the story from her work friend Irene, who heard it from \"some guy\". Joey says that he is the guy, and Rachel says that it was a guy named Ken Adams, and Joey says he is Ken Adams, much to the gang's amusement. Rachel is humiliated.Later in Rachel's apartment, Ross talks to her and admits that if Rachel hadn't come on to him, he probably would've come on to her. They reminisce on the night, and wonder if it looked amazing, as neither of them have watched the rest of the tape yet.

When questioned by Monica, Joey admits to sleeping with his interviewer \"a bit\".", "episode_8": "Chandler finds out that Monica had a hens party with a stripper (she untied his g-string with her teeth) even though they promised not to have bachelor/hens parties. Joey is very upset that he wasn't allowed to throw a bachelor party for his friend. He believes that it is a grand tradition.Rachel takes Phoebe to have dinner with Rachel's dad Dr. Leonard Green (Ron Leibman) because she is afraid her dad will be really angry when Rachel tells him she's pregnant. Dr Green is a scary character and considers Phoebe a lesbian as she wont eat chicken. He also yells at the waiter for bringing him the 1974 Lafite, as he ordered the 75. Dr. Greene is delighted to hear he will be a grandfather but demands that Rachel tell him that she and Ross will be getting married. Rachel blurts out a random date and Dr Green says he might be able to book the Plaza on short notice, delighting Rachel.\nHowever, a few minutes later, Rachel says she is not getting married to Ross, so Dr. Greene freaks out and she tells him Ross told her she's \"damaged goods\".Monica feels bad about having had a hens party so she organizes a bachelor party including a stripper for Chandler (she got the number from a waiter Stu (Fred Stoller) at work). Joey is the only \"guest\" at Chandler's bachelor party because Chandler is embarrassed and doesn't really want to have the party. The stripper arrives but turns out to be a prostitute. Chandler and Joey try to figure out why Monica would send a prostitute home.. Joey misses spending time with Chandler.\nMeanwhile Monica finds at work that she hired a prostitute and not a stripper and runs back home to stop Joey and Chandler, and arrives in time.Monica feels bad that her plan failed; she tells Chandler that she promised him a stripper and he's going to get one and begins to do a strip-tease for him herself, a solution that Chandler seems to be very happy with.Meanwhile Ross is going steady with Mona and she is really into his lectures and his semi precious stone collection. Ross hasn't yet told her about Rachel and the baby.\nDr. Greene goes to see Ross just as he's enjoying a romantic evening with Mona, who hadn't known about Rachel's pregnancy. As a result, both are furious with Ross who tries to explain himself to them, with little success. The situation becomes more humiliating when he receives a phone message from Joey about the prostitute.Rachel explains everything to her dad and Mona, who makes up with Ross. In the epilogue Dr. Greene is still yelling at Rachel, this time over the phone for not going through with the marriage, even though Rachel says she and Ross don't love each other. When Rachel leaves with the phone still off the hook, Dr. Greene not caring about her and Ross not loving each other yells \"What the hell does love have to do with it anyway?! There are more important things in a marriage other than love!\", revealing that he believes that love is insignificant in marriage. Joey picks the phone up and upon hearing Dr. Greene, who he thinks is just some guy, tells him to \"Go to Hell!\"", "episode_2": "Checking out of the wedding suite from the hotel is no happy thing for Monica, who is actually depressed that her wedding day is over. Her and Chandler's honeymoon is in three days, and the photographer's pictures will take weeks to get developed. Chandler, however, reminds her that they have the pictures from the disposable cameras at the tables to look at. Unfortunately, Chandler can't find the cameras, so he asks Ross to help him out. Ross, who checks out after the others, points out to his brother-in-law that another wedding reception is about to take place in the same hall he and Monica had theirs last night. The two buy new disposable cameras and dress up for a wedding reception they're not even invited to, hoping that Monica will never know about this.Monica, meanwhile, is flipping out because she promised Chandler they would open their wedding gifts together, but can't as he's still not home. When her curiosity gets the best of her, she opens a tiny one which contains a salt shaker. Hoping to complete the set, she opens the second one, which is roughly the size of a beach ball. She continues opening presents with uncommon ecstasy. Phoebe scares Rachel from telling the father when she remarks how her confession will change the father's life completely, something which Rachel doesn't want as she believes she's ready to raise her child by herself.Rachel is still intent not to tell who the father is, but when Joey suspects something, Phoebe sticks with her story from the wedding that she is pregnant. Joey is incredibly happy for Phoebe but equally sad that she'll be raising her kid without a father, so he proposes to fix things - by proposing to Phoebe, who accepts. Monica tells Joey that it's Rachel who's pregnant, and how she and Phoebe know about this but don't know anything about the father. This sparks something in Joey's mind, who at his apartment, finds a red sweater which he has had for a month and believes is the father's. This, in turn, is a revelation for Phoebe, who exclaims how she knows who the father is.At the reception, Ross and Chandler take tons of pictures where they try to integrate in the wedding, including one with Ross making a toast on stage (ending up warning a guest that his '95 blue-green LeSabre to move his car before it gets towed) and Chandler kissing a totally unknown bride, a picture after which Ross and Chandler run for their lives. Phoebe drags Rachel to Central Perk, where she has arranged for the father to be. Rachel, still unsure about telling the father, enters, and finds Tag (Eddie Cahill) in front of her. Phoebe pulls out the red sweater Joey found at his apartment, but it turns out it's not Tag's, who unzips his jacket to reveal his red sweater. Deeply embarrassed, Phoebe leaves the two alone, and Tag takes the opportunity to hold her hand try and get back together with Rachel, who loses no time in telling him that she's bearing child. Tag drops her hand and remains speechless until she gives him permission to leave.At the apartment, Monica has finished opening all of the gifts (including Joey's parents', which according to Joey, \"does something to salami\"). Joey, who now knows that Rachel is pregnant, proposes to her in front of Phoebe, who does not take kindly to this. Unlike Phoebe, however, Rachel refuses to marry Joey. The group is joined by Chandler and Ross, who show the pictures to Monica. Surprisingly, Monica pulls the real disposable cameras out of one of her bags. Although she's not amused to see Chandler kissing another woman, he's quite annoyed to find all the presents opened. Determined to start the marriage on the right foot, however, the two call it even. Ross is about to leave, when he spots the red sweater. He then claims that it's his, much to Monica and Phoebe's shock. He then leaves as Monica and Phoebe realize that he is the father of Rachel's baby. Joey, slow as ever, takes a minute to work this out, and is just as shocked as the others.Ross later runs into Tag on the street, both of them wearing their red sweaters. Tag indirectly references Rachel's pregnancy and asks whose baby it is, but Ross believes he is talking about the sweater and leaves thinking Tag is weird.", "episode_17": "Things have gone awkward between Joey and Rachel after their date the previous night. Joey has been avoiding Rachel.\nRachel is desperate to get back on good terms with Joey, so she takes Monica's advice to change the subject to something work-related and ask his advice on a problem. However, she can't think of anything to say and ends up blurting out that her boss Mr. Zelner (Steve Ireland) wants to buy her baby. She says Zelner and his wife cant have children. So, he got drunk at the Christmas party and offered to buy Rachel's baby.\nJoey then goes to Rachel's work and yells at her boss. Rachel panics upon hearing this for the first time, but cheers up when her boss apologizes for inadvertently sounding like he wanted to buy the baby and is so afraid that she will sue that he gives her an extra month of paid maternity leave. However, it becomes awkward between Joey and Rachel again which causes her to blurt out another lie - \"my gynecologist tried to kill me!\".When Phoebe reads her own tea leaves, she sees that she'll meet the man of her dreams soon. She assumes it's a guy she has been seeing practically every day on her errands, and finally talks to Jim (James LeGros).\nHe asks her out despite being slightly bemused when she misunderstands the pretty obvious meaning of a remark he makes but when they go on the date, he intimidates her with a number of highly inappropriate, rude, and vulgar comments suggesting Phoebe is some kind of hooker & compliments her breasts, seemingly just to amuse himself. He also claims, most likely lying in yet another attempt to intimidate her, to be a writer of \"erotic novels for children\" which are \"wildly unpopular\". He has a PhD (Pretty Huge Dick)\nPhoebe then has to find a new dry cleaning facility to avoid encountering her abnormal date again, and meets a cheerful gentleman named Parker (Alec Baldwin), who she finds more to her taste.Ross left his pink (according to him, faded salmon colored) shirt at Mona's apartment. When he knocks on Mona's door, there is no response, but he finds a key and lets himself in. However, Mona and her date enter seconds later. When Mona's date's shirt has wine spilled on it, she offers him Ross' pink shirt. Ross hides behind the couch as the two begin to kiss passionately - when Mona takes off the shirt and tosses it aside, Ross attempts to get it by pulling the carpet, but this causes the table to move and Mona discovers his presence, which causes Ross to take the shirt and leave. Mona shows up at his apartment later, telling him that she knows he came to her apartment because he still has feelings for her but tells him that it is too complicated and that it can never be. When she takes the pink shirt and asks Ross if she can keep it as something to remember him by, he refuses.", "episode_5": "Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) visits Monica (Courteney Cox) at her kitchen at Alessandro's, where she meets Tim, Monica's sous-chef.

Initially agreeing not to dump and fire him on the same day, they then argue about who should dump or fire him that day. Phoebe observes that whoever goes second is the bad one.When Phoebe meets with Tim at Central Perk to dump him, he gets paged by Monica for a meeting at work. This then results in Phoebe storming into Monica's workplace, interrupting the meeting. Left with no other options, Phoebe dumps Tim and Monica fires him simultaneously.

She asks Joey to set them up on a date (which he does as Rachel threatened to come to the studio and meet all his other actor friends, if he didn't). Joey is at first pessimistic because of Rachel's pregnancy. Rachel convinces him and then struggles to persuade Ross, who is fearful about what impact the date would have on the baby (Kash plans to take a ferry to Staten Island and Ross thinks that's very dangerous).Later, Ross admits to Joey that he always thought that when he has his next kid, it would be different. It breaks his heart to drop Ben at Carol and Susan's every time. But he is not sure if he married Rachel in his future.\nThe date ends early when Rachel accidentally tells Kash that she is pregnant. Rachel is reassured by Ross after she bumps into him on the street.

While putting this into perspective, Chandler accidentally reveals that his middle name is Muriel, and Ross and Rachel make fun of him. When Chandler's boss wants Chandler's opinion about adding Bob to his team, Chandler is negative about it. When Bob finds out it was Chandler who blocked his promotion, he vents his anger to Chandler, who he still thinks is called Toby. Chandler then attempts to reveal his true identity to Bob, but cannot go through with it when he realizes that Bob will be even angrier at him for it. Bob finally finds Chandler's office and starts trashing it. When Bob asks Chandler for help, he happily joins in destroying his own office.", "episode_13": "After his date with Rachel, Joey finds it impossible to go back to thinking about her as just a friend, yet he can't talk about it, not even with Chandler (he rambles on how Chandler and Monica were friends, but they went to London, where they were in the same place mentally and so on). He later on has the exact same conversation with Monica. As Joey rambles, he shuts up when Phoebe enters, which makes Monica conclude he must be in love with Phoebe.Monica decides to tell Phoebe, who goes to tell Joey that she knows about his feelings and that it's unlikely to work out like Chandler and Monica. Phoebe doesn't want to risk her friendship with Joey and wants to ensure that he is not hurt in the process. However, as Phoebe doesn't specify who the feelings are for, Joey believes she knows they're for Rachel and lets it slip that they are. Phoebe is surprised, but plays along that she already knew it was Rachel and assures him that his crush will eventually go away.Considering baby names, parents to be Ross and Rachel find no word in common except 'veto'!

Phoebe likes Veto.\nThey agree not to ask the child's sex, but Rachel has a moment of weakness and peeks at the file. Even though she didn't actually see the sex of the baby, Ross is convinced she did (When she agrees to the name Ruth, Ross suspects that Rachel knows its a boy and hence she is giving Ruth to Ross, so she can name the boy as per her choice when it arrives) and calls the gynecologist to find out so that they both know. He then lets it slip that the baby is a girl even though Rachel didn't have the intention to know.When Chandler says he doesn't like baths, Monica is surprised because he always likes taking them with her. Chandler tells her he doesn't like the bath, he likes \"the wet, naked lady\" in the bath with him. Monica tries to convince him that he would like a bath if she showed him the right way to prepare one. When he finally agrees to try it he loves it, but when he tries to prepare his own bath he gets everything wrong (The water was tepid, the salts didn't dissolve and now they are lodged in places. The scents he used don't complement each other), so next time Monica draws a bath for herself he steals it. Everyone gathers in the bathroom while Chandler is in the tub to share the news that Rachel and Ross are having a girl.", "episode_23": "Rachel and Ross get to the hospital, they called from the cab and asked for a private room but they claim only semi-private rooms are all they have, so they reluctantly agree have to use a semi-private room. The first couple that arrives on their room are Marc and Julie, who are having their third baby and are bemused when they see Ross in their bed wearing leg stirrups after first walking into the room, and watch in bewilderment as he struggles to get out of them and get off the bed. An initially embarrassed Ross tries to close the curtain, but they ask him to leave it open stating that they're \"all in this together.\" They have a strangely enthusiastic attitude which bemuses Ross and Rachel, and Marc suddenly pulls out a camera and takes a picture of them. Marc and Julie also appear to be amused when they realize that Rachel just had a contraction at the same time as Julie did, and Marc irritates them by taking more pictures. Later Marc informs them that he's just felt how much Julie's cervix is dilated, and Julie suggests Ross do the same with Rachel. She even suggests that Ross feel hers too in order to compare.Meanwhile, the other friends are bored to hell in the hospital. To have some fun, Monica wants to freak Chandler out. She tries to do that by saying that she wants a baby, but unexpectedly he thinks they're ready to have a baby, which freaks her out. She then tells them that she's ready to have a baby, but she wants Joey to be the father, which causes Joey to freak out, and Monica says that that reaction was all she was looking for. Judy arrives at the hospital, and has an unpleasant surprise for Ross; she wants him to marry Rachel and gives him her mother's engagement ring.Marc and Julie have left the room to have their baby, which frustrates Rachel as she was there first. There are new people, who have some unusual nicknames for each other, including \"Evil Bad Person\" and \"Sick Bastard\", and they keep fighting all the time. The woman appears to be in pain and deeply frustrated about it, and she keeps taking her anger out on her husband, accusing him of being a pervert who is leering at Rachel. He denies it, but then Ross catches him doing it and angrily threatens him, but the pained and frustrated woman apparently forgets that she'd earlier berated him for exactly the same thing and sticks up for her husband by insulting Ross. When they also leave before Rachel, a Chinese girl enters, who has very mild contractions and makes a very weird sound during that, humming and then squealing while looking concerned but not looking or sounding as if she is in pain, as if she can't feel any. Ross ends up closing the curtain in the middle of a conversation.Chandler manages to convince Monica that they're ready to have a baby. After doing some quick \"period math\" Monica says they could even start trying right away. Monica and Chandler try to find a possible place to have sex right there in the hospital, but there's a bit of a problem; each time they think they've found a vacant room, nurses walk in and interrupt them.Phoebe meets a cute guy in the elevator who broke his leg in a car accident. Just as he's going to tell her where he stays at the hospital, the door closes. With a little help from Joey, playing Dr. Drake Ramoray, she manages to find out what room he's in. At second glance, she's worried that he's just another in a long line of \"stinkers\" she's been attracting recently. She tricks Joey into playing Drake Ramoray again and asking him (Clifford 'Cliff' Burnett (Eddie McClintock)) some very personal questions, including his age, the fact that he is a widower, and his sexual agenda. Though liking the guy, Joey thinks it isn't worth it since he isn't into anything weird sexually; however, Phoebe leaps at the opportunity.When after 17 hours and three people giving birth before her Rachel is still dilated only three centimeters, she can't take it anymore and sends the next one out of the room. When the nurse manages to let her accept another patient in her room, Ross and Rachel are stunned when the patient in question turns out to be none other than Janice (Maggie Wheeler), alongside her husband Sid (Maurice Godin).

Monica dresses up as Catwoman, Phoebe as Supergirl, Chandler as a large pink bunny (Monica's idea), Ross as a potato satellite that looks a lot like feces, which he calls Spud-Nik, and Joey as Chandler. On account of her pregnancy, Rachel shows up to the party in an expensive dress she wants to wear because she soon will not be able to fit into it.Rachel's maternal instinct kicks in when the first trick-or-treat kids arrive, and she spends the evening handing out candy... most of it to a smart little girl who figures out how to charm her. She is then reduced to handing out cash until Gunther can get them some more. Finally a boy arrives who would rather have money than candy, and she yells at him until he runs away, crying-at which point guilt kicks in and she runs after him. She ends up giving him $50 and going to several houses with him posing as his girlfriend. On her return, she confesses to Joey that she is not entirely cut out for motherhood yet.Phoebe runs into her twin sister Ursula on the street. Ursula reveals that she is getting married next week and invites Phoebe to the wedding; to return the favor, Phoebe invites her and her fiance to Monica's Halloween party. Ursula's fiance Eric (Sean Penn), a 2nd-grade schoolteacher, arrives first and immediately slaps Phoebe's butt; after working through his embarrassment, they begin talking. It becomes clear after some conversation that Ursula has been lying to him, basically returning his own answers to him about her age, pastimes, history and employment, including herself being a teacher at the fictional \"Top-Secret Elementary School for the Children of Spies\". This, compounded by Eric's sudden urge to be impulsive and romantic, resulted in the two planning to be married barely three weeks after meeting. Phoebe, using Ursula's misplaced purse as evidence, breaks the news to him as gently as she can.Ross's girlfriend Mona also attends the party (as a slutty nurse) and is the first to correctly interpret Ross's costume; Ross is nervous that Joey, who has also shown attraction to her, will steal her from him. Monica and Joey get into a debate over who would win a fight between Ross and Chandler; Monica secretly thinks her brother is stronger than her husband but cannot express her opinion without offending someone. However, Joey lets it slip to Ross and Chandler, who get very competitive at each other. The two take it into their own hands by staging an arm-wrestling competition, which lasts, at total deadlock, for quite some time. Ross, who needs to impress his girlfriend, convinces Chandler to let him win (since Joey was starting to hit on Mona and Ross is worried that he will lose her), but refuses to admit it when asked later.

Then Ross suggests that Rachel change into a more appropriate dress for the doctor's appointment, angering her further. Rachel also bars Ross from calling her \"Mommy\". At the doctor's appointment, Rachel snaps at Ross for being irritating and breathing too loudly.\nEven the office tells Rachel to start her maternity leave as she is getting too cranky for everyone.Joey only has one ticket to his big movie premiere (he had requested 5 passes, but his agent Estelle Leonard (June Gable) is only able to get him one. She sold the other 4 on eBay). The others argue over who should get it (Monica offers to wear a sequin dress which offers ample cleavage. Phoebe says Joey's heart wants to pick her), but Joey says he wants Chandler to come as a way of paying him back for his support over the years. However, Chandler falls asleep during the movie and Joey is angry. He attempts to pay Chandler back by writing him a check instead, but when he realizes how much he owes Chandler (Head shots, acting classes, stage combat classes, tap dancing classes, dialect coach for the Southern accent, 3 yrs of rent, utilities, food), he decides it's not a big deal and forgives him.Monica and Phoebe make a bet (for $50) that Rachel will have her baby on a particular day.

They try everything, from herbal tea, castor oil, spicy foods to long walks, but the doctor also recommends sex.

Rachel begs for some time, but eventually gives up and goes back to being moody and difficult.\nWhen Ross and Rachel find out about the bet (Monica offers Chandler to have sex with Rachel to have the baby born on that day, since ROss was refusing to do it), Ross is angry, but Rachel wants in on it.\nAfter Rachel gets too annoying for Ross to bear at all, he decides to try having sex. After only a second or two, Rachel's water breaks.

Monica's ass gets all sweaty due to her nervousness.Monica tries everything she can to get Sandra to forgive her, but Phoebe eventually convinces her to tell Sandra off for being so rude. Monica tells Sandra that its rude to leave a party without thanking the host and the decent thing to do is to accept the apology. She says when Sandra is ready to apologize, she will be ready to accept it. But Monica feels very guilty for saying all this and rushes after Sandra to again apologize to her.At the baby shower, Rachel freaks out when she realizes that she knows virtually nothing about how to care for a baby (she gets a diaper genie in gift and didn't know what it was. Hadnt seen a breast pump before and didn't know how to use it. Didnt know that they baby goes poo-poo 10 times a day. Suggests that she would leave the baby on the changing table while she goes out to throw the garbage, and shocks everyone in the room), and her mom says that she will move in and help take care of the baby.

He says that he has already taken of Ben whenever he was visiting Ross and knows all about the Baby's needs.Joey auditions for a job as a game show host called Bamboozled and Chandler and Ross help him practice by pretending to be the contestants. The game turns out to be ridiculous (a Wicked Wango card that doesn't seem to do anything. The wheel of Mayhem. Angel pass for a free turn. Google card. Gimme Card. Backwards bonus. Ladder of Chance to the Golden Mud Hut. Hungry Monkey. Super Speedy Speed round. Hopping bonus, which cancels if you forget to switch legs between questions) and impossible to follow, but Chandler and Ross become hooked on it. Chandler calls it the best game ever.When it comes to audition for the host, Joey is informed that the producers have cut out all of the complicated elements, turning it into a simple Q&A game. Joey questions the appeal of the game until he is told that there will be hot girls in bikinis holding up the scores.\nRoss then later uses Bamboozled as a trivia game to quiz Rachel about baby care.

He has experience since his sisters have already gone through multiple pregnancies before.Ross again comes way too late (he was watching a movie with Mona at the theaters and left her behind) and when the doctor even thinks that Joey is the father, he feels very left out. Joey then suggests that Rachel moves in with Ross (Ross is missing out on the whole pregnancy and feels bad when he doesn't know little things like pickles make Rachel sick). While Rachel is reluctant at first, she agrees, which kills Joey, as he really liked living with Rachel. He reveals his feelings about living alone to Chandler, and quickly gets so depressed that he asks for a hug, which Chandler gladly gives him.Bob and Faye Bing, whom Chandler hasn't seen in fifteen years, send Monica and Chandler a very ugly punch bowl. Chandler wants to throw it out onto the street, but Monica refuses in case they ever stop by.

Ross tells Mona that he is uncomfortable with the joint holiday card, but when Mona asks where they are in their relationship (She loves spending time with him, but thinks that they should be moving forward), Ross agrees to do the card.Ross wants to avoid the conversation with Mona and decides that he will make a gesture that suggests they are moving forward, without having the conversation. Moving in is too much, mix tape is too little, and saying \"I Love spending time with you\" is like a slap in the face. He tells Mona that he likes her and is having fun, but the lack of reaction from Mona means that Ross has to make a bigger gesture. This results in him giving Mona a key to his apartment even though he doesn't want to and it is the only key.\nRoss then has the locks changed and Mona is confused. He then tells Mona he loves her (he doesn't mean it though) and she replies that she loves spending time with him too, letting Ross know that she isn't in love with him either.Chandler's boss, Doug (Sam McMurray), has divorced his wife and invites Chandler and Monica to dinner, but Monica strongly dislikes him for drunkenly urinating on their ice sculpture at their engagement party (and hence he was not invited to their wedding), so Chandler decides to tell Doug that Monica and him split up so that she won't have to come. Doug, who is clearly depressed after divorcing his wife, takes Chandler to a series of bars and strip clubs to help him forget Monica, and Chandler has a miserable time with his drunk, crude boss (who makes Chandler remove his wedding ring), but later tells Monica that the worst thing of all about that night was seeing a glimpse of how he would end up if he ever lost her, and asks her to promise him she will never leave and grow old with him, and she does.\nMonica wants to send a holiday card together with Chandler, but even he says that they are not there yet.Rachel's pregnancy hormones cause her to lust after any and every guy she sees (Even the doctor who does her sonogram at the hospital), and she finds herself wanting to sleep with Joey and Ross. To satisfy her craving, Phoebe brings a random guy called Roger (He is a partially bald guy, and looks like a complete idiot, and is a virgin to boot) to the apartment who says he'll have sex with her, but Rachel refuses the offer.\nWhen Joey returns home, Rachel confides in him that she is looking for one great night with a guy who knows what he is doing. She finds herself attracted to Joey and they both back off.", "episode_18": "It's Ross & Monica's parents' 35th wedding anniversary, and Monica is very excited to be giving the speech at this year's celebration. Usually, Ross gives a very moving speech and makes everyone cry. Monica's attempts at writing a moving speech get pretty far-fetched, bringing up dead relatives and pets (Their dog Chi-Chi died when Monica was in High school) to get a few tears. This doesn't work very well.\nPhoebe has decided that \"fate\" has brought her to her new boyfriend, Parker. He is a constantly cheerful, talkative, energetic and enthusiastic person with a wacky personality and a strange and annoying habit of making a big fuss of everything, even the most trivial things (he calls Long Island Expressway a concrete miracle)...and his habit of doing this irritates the friends greatly. But Phoebe stands up for Parker and says that their own collective dating record is the who's who of human crap.At the anniversary party, Parker is driving everyone crazy with his ridiculously over-the-top compliments on absolutely everything. Phoebe catches the others making fun of Parker and gets upset, but then realizes that he is driving her crazy as well. Monica & Ross's parents also tell Rachel & Ross that since they are having a child out of wedlock, they've actually told all of their friends that they got married. They don't want to pretend, but when several people give them checks as wedding gifts, they play along. When guests ask for details about the proposal and wedding, they actually end up having a lot of fun telling others about their fantasy day, with Rachel creating various extravagant details while Ross tells a touching story about proposing to her in the planetarium where they had their first date, making it seem like there is some spark left between them.Monica gives the anniversary toast and it's a total dud. She gets desperate and brings up Terms of Endearment and neglected Romanian children in an attempt to get her parents to become emotional and cry, but her speech eventually gets so ridiculous that no-one can feel anything except bewilderment after hearing it, not even the starry-eyed Parker. Ross then gets up and gives a brief two-sentence toast stating that he and Rachel would consider themselves lucky to be half as happy as Jack and Judy (Christina Pickles) in thirty-five years, which makes his parents cry. Monica is frustrated.Parker breaks up with Phoebe for angrily telling him, after getting fed up with his constant enthusiasm, that she wants him to be \"much less happy.\" After arguing with her, Parker angrily storms out of the room...and then returns to compliment the argument.\nBack at their apartment, Ross and Rachel continue to debate some details of their fictional marriage, with Rachel being touched when she learns that Ross's story about his proposal to her was the one he actually planned to use when they were going out, saying \"it would be something she'd find hard to have said no to.\"At the end of the episode, a sympathetic Ross comforts an upset Monica, assuring her that he thought her speech was great, and he doesn't understand why nobody cried, also claiming that their late grandmother would have loved it, and that she was there in spirit.

When finding out that Ross will be joining them for dinner he is glad that he'll get to see him again, though when Monica informs him that Rachel will be coming too he instantly becomes disappointed (and starts to carve carbohydrates again as he gets stressed by the news), and points that he hates her because she constantly made fun of him during high school.Throughout dinner, Will is hostile to Rachel (he calls out that Rachel is selfish and lives in her own world, oblivious to the existence of everyone else around her), and eventually refreshes her memory about her making his life miserable, she tries to apologize and generally feels bad until he reveals that during high school, he co-created a club against her called \"The I Hate Rachel Greene\" Club, when asked who the other co-founder was he reveals that Ross was, surprising Rachel.\nRoss tries to control the situation by saying that in a way, the only members of the club were people who loved Rachel.\nWill also reveals that during high school they made a rumor about her being a hermaphrodite (Her parents flipped a coin and decided to raise Rachel as a girl). Not only was Rachel unaware of the rumor, but she was also unaware that everyone in her school (and even Chandler's school) knew about it.\nShe reacts tearfully, claiming she never hurt Ross in high school, until Monica reminds her that she started a rumor of her own that Ross made out with the school's 50-year-old librarian, Mrs. Altman. Ross however freaks out and inadvertently blurts out that it's in fact the truth.When Ross and Rachel argue, Monica reminds them that they are having a child together and that some things are more important than high school. After hearing this Will is shocked but also proud that he's not marrying her. He attempts to high five Ross, but Ross declines.

They also allow him to put on one more striptease routine for them which they all end up enjoying anyway.Meanwhile, Joey appears on the celebrity game show, \"Pyramid\", where he loses almost every round (In the first round, he had to give the clues, but messed each one), though his partner's clues are apparent and simple.

He needs the money.\nJoey pairs up with Gene's opponent and Joey doesn't get even a single clue about US congress. The rival gets zero points and Gene goes to the winner's circle with Joey.

Gene goes home without any money.Chandler and Ross go to a college reunion, recalling the various misadventures that they experienced in 1987. They both run into Missy Goldberg (Ellen Pompeo) and remember that they both had a crush on her in 1987 and made a pact never to ask her out, lest it comes in between their friendship. Now, Ross asks Chandler for permission to break the pact and ask her out. When Ross speaks to Missy, he finds that Chandler used to make out with her, a lot. Ross confronts Chandler and Chandler says even he broke some pacts. Ross kissed Adrienne (who was also under a pact) at the college Christmas party, where he invited Rachel and Monica.\nThat night Chandler was angry, and wanted to hurt Ross. Chandler tells Ross that he kissed Rachel at a party in college, which upsets Ross because that was the night he kissed Rachel for the first time as well. Later at Monica and Chandler's apartment, Ross and Chandler tell Monica that Rachel had kissed the both of them at the college party. When Ross said that Rachel was on his bed, Chandler reveals he put Rachel on his bed. This causes Ross to wonder who was on his bed, before Monica realizes she was and Ross is disgusted to realize that it wasn't Rachel who he had kissed, it was Monica, his own sister. In horror, Monica realizes that Ross, her own brother was her first kiss ever. After hearing these details, Chandler is stunned and questions what kind of family he married into.", "episode_6": "Ross is very excited about a big grant he's hoping to get ($25000, which he needs to complete his field research), but his hopes vanish as soon as they arise when he learns that the professor administering the grant is his girlfriend Charlie's ex-boyfriend, the accomplished and famous paleontologist Benjamin Hobart (Greg Kinnear). Charlie is sure that this won't get in Ross' way, and books a dinner for the three of them. It only takes a detour of hers to the restroom for Ross to learn that Benjamin is still in love with Charlie and wants Ross to break up with her.Thinking it insane to do so, Ross refuses; however, at the meeting for the grant the next day, contrary to his other colleagues, he's asked trivial nonsense questions (When is my birthday, which 1965 Shirelles hit was later covered by a popular British invasion band, spell Bascodictiasaur (it starts with a silent M)) to which Ross has no answer. When Ross confronts him about this, Hobart explains how he's ready to offer Ross the grant only if he breaks up with Charlie.Furious, Ross explains everything to Charlie, who doesn't believe him in the least since it was Benjamin who had broken up with her in the first place. Ross drags her with him to Hobart, who confesses his undying love for Charlie. Unfortunately for Ross, Charlie still has feelings for Hobart and the two end up making out in front of him, whereupon Ross flat-out concedes.Now that Mike is moving in, Phoebe has to compromise the decor in her apartment and get rid of a bunch of stuff, including Gladys - a three-dimensional painting of a half-bald mannequin. Out of friendship (and also with much regret), Monica agrees to take Gladys for herself. To complicate matters for her, Phoebe gives her the painting in front of Rachel, who loses no time in suggesting the most prominent places in the apartment where Monica could hang it.Monica tricks Joey into buying the portrait by presenting it as \"an original Buffay\", but Rachel lures Joey in believing that the painting is haunted. The girls eventually try to press Gladys onto each other, when Phoebe presents them with Glynnis, which by comparison makes Gladys look like an angelic portrait. Monica and Rachel quickly change their mind about Gladys; Rachel ends up with her, while Monica gets Glynnis. The paintings soon become a source of entertainment - Rachel uses Gladys to scare Joey in his sleep, but is frightened off by Monica holding up Glynnis behind her.Chandler's work is hitting new heights, as a national commercial based mostly on his ideas is in production. Joey begs his friend for a part, but Chandler finds Joey inadequate for the part. Joey insists by giving Chandler a tape to pass on to his bosses so that they could decide. Chandler sticks to his thoughts, and taking Rachel's advice, doesn't pass the tape. Chandler doesn't even bother to watch the tape himself, but when Joey asks him if he watched the tape, the latter gets suspicious and knows his friend's lying. When Joey finally confronts Chandler, he reveals how he knows about all the lying by popping the video in the player. The video shows Joey with blue lips promoting blue lip-stick for men (a commercial which aired only in Japan).

Now all four of the friends are convinced that Chandler is cheating on Monica.\nThe four of them go across the hall to break the bad news to Monica, but all she asks is whether they liked the house and the neighborhood. When Chandler gets home, he and Monica admit that the woman they saw him with was their Realtor, Nancy -- they've decided they want to raise their child in the suburbs, and have made an offer on the house in Westchester.\nThey don't want to raise their kid inside the city. Monica wants a lawn and swing set and a street where kids can ride their bikes. Ross thinks the couple is just trying to get it out of their system and that NYC is the only place to be.

However Chandler states they are no better because they went to the game without him.Eventually the four decide to go home and celebrate Thanksgiving day away but Joey's head soon gets stuck in the crack, prompting the other three to put items (like Monica's Brussels sprouts that were cooking in Joey's oven) down his pants.

However, Chandler and the others exert so much force that the chain breaks, causing Joey to crash into part of the Thanksgiving dinner (including the cranberry sauce), making a giant mess.\nChandler expects Monica to be furious over the mess, but Monica doesn't care because the phone call she just answered was from the adoption agency and she just found out that she and Chandler have been selected by a girl from Ohio to adopt her baby.

After she denies this, and Rachel and Phoebe also deny it being theirs, Chandler finds out that they were her grandmother's (he finds pics in the closet of the handcuff being used by Monica's grandmother).However, they find the time to throw a going-away party for Rachel. She decides to privately talk to her friends during the party. Each and every speech ends in a very touching moment for them: Phoebe (who tries to give her a swab of Phoebe's saliva to clone her with), Monica (to whom Rachel notes that none of what has happened to her over the show would have been possible without her, and with each noting that they feel like sisters, they end up breaking down and talking in-distinctively), Chandler (who tells her he loves her, and is so torn that he ends up telling jokes again, ruining the moment), and Joey (where it is unknown what exactly she tells him, but it is so unbearable that he attempts to jump off the balcony, but is stopped by Rachel). However, when it comes to Ross, who has been anxious about his goodbye the entire time, Rachel completely blows him off without a goodbye speech and leaves, baffling everyone else.Ross is so upset about this that he forgets his pride and confronts her at Joey's apartment, expressing disappointment that after everything they have been through, he can't believe she wants to leave things between them on nothing. He then storms off to his place. Not long after, Erica comes over to the apartment, where she has contraction pains. Monica and Chandler take her to the hospital for the birth of their child.At Ross' apartment, Rachel comes storming in, slamming the door. She angrily explains to him that the reason she didn't give him a goodbye is not because he means less to her than everyone else, but because he means more, and that the mere thought of not seeing him every day makes her not want to go, making it too hard to bid him goodbye.

However, Rachel and Phoebe want revenge, and decide to mess with the duo by having Phoebe pretend to be attracted to Chandler (she squeezes his biceps and then laughs out loud at his silly jokes.. She says she hasn't been with a guy for far too long and didn't realize what she wanted was right in front of her). Chandler later informs a skeptical Monica that Phoebe was flirting with him.Upon discovering that Ugly Naked Guy is subletting the apartment himself, Ross attempts to bribe him with a basket of mini-muffins.

During the ride, a car backfire scares them all, leading to Joey diving over Ross in an attempt to save him. This causes problems between Chandler and Joey because Joey apparently wanted to save Ross instead of Chandler, his best friend.

Monica decides to organize photos, but Rachel accidentally drops a box of other pictures on it, ruining all Monica's work.

Monica thinks they should erase the message (She doesn't want Ross getting back together with the controlling, Neurotic Emily), but Rachel thinks Ross deserves to know the truth. During the discussion, she accidentally erases the message.After being \"saved\", Ross is filled with a new-found respect for life, which he reports to his own answering machine, resulting in the message being heard by the girls, who are still at his apartment. Later, in person, Rachel tells Ross about the message from Emily, but Ross wants to call her back, because he wants to seize every new opportunity (he says he really wants to seize something, as his ex-wife called on the same day that he had a near death experience). Rachel talks this idea out of Ross' mind by convincing him that it is not the day of seizing stuff, but escaping from stuff, such as \"death\" and from Emily. Ross is convinced that it is close call day. He tells Rachel to tell Monica to give him back his money.", "episode_16": "In the teaser, Chandler and Monica cuddle while cooperating on a crossword puzzle, which Joey finds cute. That night, however, he dreams that he was doing the crossword puzzle with Monica, leading him to wonder if he finds her attractive. This is exacerbated when, at Central Perk the next morning, Monica is found wearing his sweatshirt as opposed to Chandler's, and later when Monica asks him to taste her cooking, leading to him confessing about his dreams. A bit of honest discussion between the three of them reveals that Joey is not really attracted to Monica, but rather to the intimacy and friendship she shares with Chandler. He wishes he has the same in some of his relationships, as he has never had that before.The two explain that this is because they were friends first before they started dating. Equipped with this new philosophy, he first tries to get on Rachel's good side (he greets her with a trademark \"How you Doin\"), on the grounds that they are already friends (But since Joey saw Rachel first he started hitting on her), but she advises him to strike up a friendship with a woman and then pursue a relationship (not by hitting on his existing friends). Joey tries to do this, but when meeting a woman to strike up a friendship (he realizes that he has a great pick up line), he ends up in a threesome with her and her roommate.While digging beneath a Central Perk chair cushion for spare change, Phoebe uncovers a policeman's badge. Though she promises to return it, she finds using it far more entertaining, exploiting her new-found power to force a smoking bystander to apologize to a tree on which she snubbed out a cigarette. When she begins threatening her friends with arrest, she realizes she has gone too far, but before she can return it, she tries to force an illegally-parked man to move his car. He turns out to be a policeman as well, and is unimpressed when she claims to be an undercover cop from the 57th district of Manhattan. When Phoebe knows she has been busted, she throws the badge at him and runs away.\nThis fellow, Gary (Michael Rapaport), turns out to be the owner of the badge, but when he arrives at Monica's apartment to arrest her, he asks her out on a date instead. He found Phoebe's fingerprints on his badge, and found her records, and Monica's apartment was listed as her last known address.Rachel is helping Ross shop for a new couch. After he finds one he likes, he forgoes delivery charges (which cost as much as the new couch) by having her help him carry it the three blocks to his apartment (he also fends off a condescending salesman (who insinuates that Ross couldn't possibly have dated Rachel) by proclaiming that he and Rachel have had sex 298 times, leaving Rachel incredulous as to how he kept count). Getting it up a narrow stairwell proves more problematic, and after Rachel gets help from Chandler (Pivot, pivot, pivot) (Ross wanted Joey, and the next best thing would have been Monica), the three attempt to manhandle the couch up the stairs, only to get it stuck between landings. The couch ends up cut in half after Rachel accidentally pulls the fire alarm and Ross' neighbors have to walk over the couch.

Monica starts having sex with Chandler again.Ross finally contacts Emily to try and work things out (Ross was calling everyone on her side of the family, and Emily finally calls asking Ross to stop harassing everyone). At first Emily says she is willing to make things work if Ross moves to London. Ross explains to Emily that he cant move to London without Ben. She agrees to come to New York, but only if Ross agrees never to see Rachel (she was humiliated at the altar and then again at the airport and doesn't want to be in the same room as Rachel).\nRoss asks his friends for an answer and they cant decide. So, Ross gets a magic 8 ball. The 8 balls is also unhelpful when it says \"ask again later\"..\nRachel meets Ross. She doesn't know what Emily's condition is.. Rachel advises Ross to give her whatever Emily wants to make his marriage work. Ross tells Emily that he agrees to her condition and asks her to come to NYC.Joey lands a job on a PBS telethon (he thinks he landed a job as co-host, but much to his chagrin he is just working the phones and taking pledges.. Gary Collins is the host), much to Phoebe's disapproval (she hates PBS as she wrote to Sesame street after her mom died and no-one ever wrote back. All she got was a lousy key chain), who believes there is no such thing as a selfless good deed (she says Joey going on PBS is not a selfless good deed as he is going to get TV exposure).\nAt the telethon, Joey tries to switch seats with someone who is in the TV shot, but he refuses.. They end up having a scuffle on-air.Phoebe does her best to find a selfless good deed, after Joey retorts that there are no selfless good deeds (Phoebe giving birth to her brother's triplets was selfish, since it made her feel good).

She will find a selfless good deed.\nPhoebe calls Joey saying that she went to the park and let a bee sting her. This made the bee look good in front of its bee friends.

She donates $200 to Sesame street.. She is still mad at them, but they make a lot of kids happy, so this is a selfless good deed.

He puts a strong note on the top of his sandwich (which was written by Phoebe, who says Ross has to scare people off) to keep people away. He new, aggressive avatar scares his coworkers who try to give him a lot of leeway and free space (they call him mental Gellar).

Phoebe points out that the real reason Ross is mad is because he finds Caitlin attractive, and Ross takes the opportunity to flirt with her when he finds a missing vegetarian pizza for Phoebe.Ross makes inappropriate comments to Caitlin (that he likes 8 yr old boys.. he was referring to Ben) and saddened by his effort (when even Rachel responds that Ross was not good at the flirting thing), he orders another pizza and practices flirting with Phoebe. Caitlin arrives with the pizza, but Ross screws up the flirting again, ending up talking to her about gas and methane (gas is odorless, but they add the smell so that it can be noticed while it leaks). He scares her so much that she pays for the pizza herself and flees the apartment.Out of pity for Ross, Rachel catches up with Caitlin and tries to talk her into going out with Ross (She explains that Ross gets really nervous when he is flirting).

On the way to the hospital, Wilson suggested that they freeze Amber's heart to give House more time to diagnose her, but he soon began questioning why she was with House on the bus.The team bought some time for a diagnosis by freezing Amber's heart, then went to work. The fact that her heart was slowed down made the diagnosis more difficult. House sent Kutner and Thirteen to Amber's house to look for anything that might have made her sick, and Taub came to House alone to ask him what chance there was that he and Amber hooked up during the time House couldn't remember. At the very least, he wondered whether they might have done any drugs together. House didn't answer, Taub did the tox screen. It was negative.Inside Amber's House, Kutner and Thirteen found a video clip on Amber's laptop that showed her and Wilson getting ready to record themselves having sex on her couch. Thirteen shut it off, saying it wasn't medically relevant. She thought the team shouldn't be treating Amber because they were too personally involved.In his office, House had a dream of Amber walking in and giving him the idea that they might have hooked up. She suggested maybe she'd always had a thing for him and he'd always had a thing for her. She poured a glass of sherry and climbed onto his lap (in the dream!) and House woke up, startled. House wanted to unlock the memory from his brain by undergoing deep brain stimulation, electric impulses applied to his brain.House pulled Thirteen aside and told her to get over whatever it was that bothering her and \"do your job.\" Amber's liver was failing. House wondered about that sherry that Amber poured in his dream. It was a clue about which bar they'd been at the night before, Sharrie's. House took Wilson there and the bartender tossed House the keys to his motorcycle as soon as he walked in the door. The bartender (yes, that was Fred Durst, the Limp Bizkit dude!) said that seemed like he was into the woman he was with at the bar. House had a flash of himself walking with his arm around Amber. Wilson wondered about the \"seemed into her\" line.Back at the hospital, Thirteen's job was being affected by her feelings about them treating Amber. This opened the door for quick background on Kutner: He was 6 when his parents' business was robbed and the robbers shot his mother and father. \"Everyone dies,\" he told Thirteen.House was starting to let Wilson affect his treatment of Amber, much to the dismay of Foreman. He believed House was letting Wilson's emotions get in the way of the treatment. He later went to Cuddy and told her that House was going to kill the patient. Cuddy and Foreman restarted her heart and possibly damaged her brain in the process.In a restroom meeting, House confronted Thirteen and suggested that she was all torn up about Amber because she couldn't stand watching a young doctor die because of her own fear that she was living with Huntington's Disease but hasn't been tested. In a following montage, Thirteen drew her own blood.When House finally started making decisive calls about how Amber should be treated, Cuddy told Wilson to back off and let House do his job. He then asked House to do the deep brain stimulation, risking his life to save Amber's. House agreed to do it. In a bizarre scene of electric shocks to the brain, House pieced together the night's events. He remembered the bartender taking his keys because he'd had too much to drink. He asked to make a phone call and called Wilson's house but Wilson was on call and Amber answered. She agreed to pick House up from the bar, but he coaxed her into having one drink with him. House stumbled out of to bar to ride the bus home and left his cane. Amber found it and brought it to him on the bus. A few minutes later, the crash happened.House recalled Amber sneezing, but it wasn't as simple as the flu. It was the medicine she was taking for it. She had amantadine poisoning. Wilson reasoned that the crash destroyed Amber's kidneys, which took away her ability to process the drugs. But House told him the amantadine binds with proteins and dialysis couldn't clear it out of her bloodstream. \"There's nothing we can do,\" House told Wilson. House's memory led up to the moment of the crash, and he had a seizure.Once it was clear that Amber was going to die, Cuddy suggested to Wilson that they wake her up so he could have a few more hours with her. Wilson broke down. When Amber awoke, he explained to her what happened and she understood that she was going to die. She said she shouldn't have gotten on the bus. Wilson told her it wasn't her fault (did he think it was House's fault?). The team visited Amber and said goodbye, then Wilson laid in bed with her and hugged her until the bitter end.Back in House's room, he laid unconscious when he saw Amber in one last dream sequence on the bus. He told Amber he should have been the one who was dead. He was afraid Wilson was going to hate him, and Amber told him he kind of deserves it. House suggested that he wanted to stay dead with Amber and didn't want to get off the dream bus \"because it doesn't hurt here. I don't want to be in pain, I don't want to be miserable. I don't want him to hate me.\" Amber told him he can't always get what he wants. House got up and walked out of his dream, waking up in his hospital bed with Cuddy next to him.Meanwhile, Thirteen pulled her test results and saw that was positive for Huntington's. Taub rolled into bed with his wife. Kutner ate cereal while watching TV. Foreman met up with Chase and Cameron at a bar. Wilson went to House's room and stood outside, meeting eyes with House briefly before walking away. When he laid down in bed, Wilson found a note Amber left that read, \"Sorry I'm not here. Went to pick up House.\"", "episode_14": "The night opened on a TV show about an agonizing doctor, but it wasn't the one you were expecting. It was House's favorite soap opera and its star was about to get a real surprise. House kidnapped him and told him he was going to save his life. House was convinced the guy (yes, that was Jason Lewis, a.k.a. Smith Jerrod from \"Sex and the City\") had a brain tumor. When those tests turned out negative, House injected the soap star with a sedative to keep him in the hospital for an MRI that also came up negative.House was ready to let the guy go, hoping he wouldnt' sue him and the hospital, but when the patient lost feeling in his foot, everything changed.Meanwhile, Cuddy was stressed about a surprise visit from a hospital accreditation inspector and told Cameron and Foreman to keep an eye on House to make sure he didn't mess anything up.Wilson limped around with a bad back and said it was Amber's mattress that was causing the problem. When he told House that he and Amber were going to shop for a new one, House predicted things would get weird and Amber would get her way. When they shopped Amber preferred the firm mattress and Wilson wanted a pillow top. In the end, Amber told him to get the one he wanted and he called House to rejoice in the fact that House was wrong about Amber.Cuddy's ploy to get Cameron back in House's circle to take notes on his work was brilliant as Cameron started making suggestions for how to treat the patient. House told Cameron that if she wanted her old job back, he'd fire Thirteen.As the team tried to figure out what was wrong with the patient, House thought it might be his thyroid and Foreman agreed with him. Foreman said the team should nuke the guy's thyroid and House was happy. Before the nuking, though, Foreman had the team run an iodine test, per hospital protocol, that showed his thyroid was fine but revealed that the patient's kidneys were failing. House got angry and told Foreman and Taub that since they were so eager to adhere to procedure, they should measure all the ceiling heights around the hospital to make sure nothing was stacked within 18 inches of them, because that's what hospital rules mandate.House confronted Cameron about the fact that she missed being involved with his cases, and she admitted she did miss the job. She missed the puzzles and the work, but, she told him, \"I don't miss you.\"Wilson's bed situation got a little weird when Amber got upset with him for picking the firm mattress, which was the one she wanted. She told him she wanted him to pick the one he wanted so that he would be happy. She said he always let his ex-wives have their way, but ended up resenting them in the end and she didn't want the same to happen with her.Wilson took House back to the mattress store and finally expressed interest in a waterbed, which he knew was stupid. House agreed, but told him to \"live the dream\" anyway. Wilson got the waterbed home, but ended up sleeping on the living room floor because he couldn't stand the life aquatic. House decided that his patient must have a floral allergy and wanted to fill the guy up with 100 milligrams of a steroid that would cure it. Cuddy became nervous, worried that the guy would die from an overdose unless House was right. She told him that their jobs were riding on his next move, but he did it anyway. House was wrong about the floral allergy, but his treatment saved the guy anyway.The inspector fined the hospital $200,000, but neither Cuddy or House was fired. It wasn't until later that House realized the guy was allergic to quinine, based on some more careful viewing of the soap opera. Even House is sometimes more lucky than good.", "episode_3": "In continuing with the search for a new staff, House (Hugh Laurie) decides to split up the remaining people into two teams in order to diagnose a man who's already suffering from a severe ascending muscle weakness. In the meantime, a patient from the clinic makes House wonder if there's life after death. Cameron (Jennifer Morrison), Chase (Jesse Spencer) and Foreman (Omar Epps) also appear in their new working environment.The main patient is Stark (Brian Klugman), a 37 y/o man with Spinal Muscular Atrophy, an incurable and progressive neurological disease that weakens muscles. He is wheelchair bound and assisted by his dog Hoover. While crossing the street, Stark faints without warning and is nearly hit by a car. He is admitted to the hospital to find out why he had the fainting spell.House divides the ten remaining applicants into two teams of five each: boys versus girls. The team that diagnoses Stark correctly wins and gets to remain. The losing team is fired. Everybodys favorite alpha-female Amber (Anne Dudek) wants to join the mens team but they rebuff her.Both teams initially consider that Stark may have picked up a bacterial infection from his dog Hoover, but discard the idea. The womens team now decides he must have become infected with Strongyloides (threadworm) on his recent trip to Thailand. They treat him with Ivermectin, an antihelminthic drug (i.e. an anti-worm drug). The men have no working diagnosis and want to run a full battery of tests on Starks hair, blood, and stool. During this conversation, it is revealed Stark is also incredibly constipated. Amber manages to finagle her way onto the mens team by convincing them to try xenodiagnosis basically, have a bug bite the patient, and test the bug for any parasites that the patient may have. In the middle of the test, Stark starts choking and coughing.The next morning, House reveals the patient has suffered an aspiration, but is improving on oxygen and chest PT. House seems intrigued by the womens diagnosis of Strongyloides and dismayed that the men have only managed to run test after test. He places the mens team in the penalty box making them sit in his office and not talk about the case while the women go about proving theirs. Their plan is to perform a tilt table test on Stark and try to induce a fainting spell. If the test is negative and there is no fainting, then their diagnosis and treatment must be right (but not necessarily, the tilt table test only reproduces certain types of syncope and not the type the patient has and/or he might be getting better for other reasons beside their treatment).Amber and the guys have not given up. They want to know whether Starks choking is dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) or achalasia (an esophageal motility disorder). The old guy suggests paraganglioma a tumor in the neck that presses against the vagal nerve, thus causing fainting, whenever the patient eats. The tilt table test is negative, seeming to confirm the womens diagnosis and treatment, but Amber runs a CT on Stark anyway. No tumor is revealed, but she believes the results are consistent with scleroderma, a type of connective tissue disease commonly affecting the skin and esophagus. House disagrees and fires the men and Amber. Shes not done though, she talks Chase into running labs on the patient for her. She wants to run an anti-centromere antibody test, a blood test sensitive for scleroderma. When she draws the patients blood, it turns out to be green.With this finding, House rehires the mens team and Amber because the diagnosis he thought was right clearly is not. The plastic surgeon deduces the blood is green because the contrast for the CT the patient had the day before has not been filtered out by the kidneys meaning Stark has kidney failure.The differential is now a gram negative bacterial infection from his indwelling catheter versus scleroderma. House orders Stark to be started on Ampicillin and Gentamicin, two potent antibiotics, for the possible infection; he also orders skin and lymph node biopsies to look for scleroderma. Shortly, the team reveal the antibiotics are having no effect and the biopsies are negative. Or are they? House notices some black specks in the cervical lymph node biopsy and suspects Stark has melanoma of the eye which has spread throughout the body. He wants to remove the eye and manages to talk Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) into agreeing with the surgery. Before surgery, the applicants are performing a thoracentesis (draining the fluid from around Starks lungs) to make his breathing easier when they notice the fluid is clear. This is not consistent with fluid from a cancer, which tends to be cloudy and bloody. Stepping in after House's injury (discussed below), Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) and the team decide Stark has Eosinophilic Pneumonia, and he is started on corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide (a potent immune suppressant and chemotherapy drug, used for certain types Eosinophilc Pneumonia). The medication doesn't help and Stark dies quickly and quietly, his faithful dog by his side. When the dog is revealed to be dead a few minutes later, House realizes Hoover took the patient's Invermectin (fatal to the breed) instead of the patient. Thus, the women were right and the patient had Strongyloides all along, and died of an overwhelming threadworm infection.While the team is treating Stark, House sees a patient in clinic who pulls out a knife and sticks it in the wall socket right in front of him. House manages to revive him and the patient admits he was in a car accident a few days previous and experienced a near death experience. He reports it was the happiest that hes ever been and wants to replicate the experience.Later, when Wilson accuses House of not knowing for sure whether there is an afterlife or not, House decides to find out for himself, and sticks the patient's knife in a wall socket (but not before paging Amber). She performs CPR and manages to revive him, though he suffered a burned hand and an extended loss of consciousness. Because of this, Wilson had to take over Stark's case in the end.Meanwhile, at a hospital across town, Foreman is running his own diagnostic team, only he is trying to make it friendlier and more supportive than Houses. They have a patient with fever, boggy lungs, and blurry vision who the antibiotics arent helping. The team diagnoses Apergillosis and starts the patient on Amphotericin B. It doesn't help, and the patient now develops yellow gums, a sign of jaundice. Foreman believes the patient has anaplastic large cell lymphoma, a rare and aggressive cancer. He wants to start treatment right away. His boss disagrees and feels a severe infection is most likely.She has Foreman start a potent antibiotic. Foreman's gut feeling gets the best of him and he stops the antibiotic and starts the cancer therapy. He is correct and saves the patient's life, but his boss fires him for not following the guidelines and putting his gut feelings ahead of medicine.(Ed.

He is trying to persuade her to go to a movie that evening, but she declines, citing fatigue and sneezing. She tells him that she thinks shes having hallucinations because the building seems to be shaking. There is a sudden roar as her office building collapses in a gas main explosion.Its now two days later. Megan is one of the few survivors of the explosion, but she is still very severely injured. She has been through multiple surgeries for fractures and burns. Cuddy consults House because Megan has been running a persistent fever despite being on antipyretics (fever reducing medication like acetaminophen or ibuprofen). She has also been lapsing in and out of consciousness. Cuddy wants to use this case as a goad to get House working with a team again, but he refuses. He cuts her a deal: if he can solve the case by himself that day, she will not bug him for a week.House ropes a passing janitor into helping him. He describes the case to him in mechanical terms, and asks him what he would do. The two of them come up with several possible diagnoses: brain damage with hypothalamic dysfunction (which House discards because it would have shown up on the brain MRI she already had), infection (possible parasitic or fungal infection, admits House), or Lupus (the janitors grandmother had Lupus). House wants to break into Megans house, but the janitor refuses (or at least refuses for the amount of money House is offering him). In the end, House shanghais Wilson to help him search the house. They find a diary which reveals that Megan had a history of fatigue and feeling blue. From this, House infers that Megan has depression. He then makes the leap that she was on a certain kind of antidepressant (an MAO Inhibitor a class of antidepressants used only rarely, if that, because safer more effective drugs are now available), that when combined with Demerol (a narcotic pain killer) she received in the ER, can cause Serotonin Syndrome, of which fever is one symptom (This is true, but there are other symptoms of Serotonin Syndrome which should have shown up as well. Serotonin Syndrome appears rapidly, and should have shown up within a few hours of receiving Demerol, and should have resolved by now, several days since she has had either antidepressants or Demerol.) House decides to place Megan on dialysis to remove the drugs from her system (not a common treatment for Serotonin Syndrome, but it has been used in severe cases). Her boyfriend insists that Megan was not depressed, seeing a psychiatrist, or on antidepressants, but House believes that Megan was just hiding it from him. He gets her mother to sign the consent.After the dialysis she wakes up and confirms through blinking that she was seeing a psychiatrist and was on an MAO Inhibitor. She then develops ventricular tachycardia and slips into unconsciousness and cardiac arrest. Cuddy has to defibrillate her back into a normal rhythm.House considers his deal with Cuddy done and himself the winner, but Cuddy disagrees. She wants him to figure out why Megan developed tachycardia. Endocarditis (an infection of the heart) is considered at first, but discarded because blood cultures were negative. Cuddy and House now consider that Megan may have cardiac damage from Crush Syndrome. Crush Syndrome occurs when a patient has been trapped under a heavy object, crushing part of their body and cutting off blood flow. The damage from the crush injury causes an increase in toxic chemicals in the affected parts of the body. When the patient is then released from the heavy object and blood flow resumes, these chemicals circulate throughout their body, causing a variety of serious problems (Shes been in the hospital for 3 days at this point, routine labs should have shown any Crush Syndrome by now; its not going to show up suddenly this late). House and Cuddy suspect the high potassium from the crush injury combined with microvascular occlusion have caused the heart problem, but luckily, this will show up on an echocardiogram. The echocardiogram is obtained, but it is completely normal. Taking the tachycardia (but normal echocardiogram), sweating, and fever into account, House now decides that Megan is suffering from delirium tremens (alcohol withdrawal). Her boyfriend again objects, saying that he would have noticed if she were an alcoholic. House ignores him and starts her on IV ethanol, which does correct her fever and tachycardia. In real life, IV alcohol is not the recommended treatment for delirium tremens because it doesnt solve the dependency problem, just prolongs it. Plus, it can lead to electrolyte abnormalities (which Megan already has), gastritis, pancreatitis, and hepatitis. Benzodiazepines (such as Valium, Ativan, or Librium) are the treatment of choice.When Cuddy visits Megan and her family, she realizes that Megan has been silently screaming in pain for the past 2 hours (but apparently the pain wasnt enough to raise her blood pressure or heart rate noticeably). Labs show an elevated amylase and lipase, meaning that Megan has developed pancreatitis. The alcohol was the most likely cause for the pancreatitis, but there can be other causes as well. House obtains an MRI which shows a normal pancreas (when it should at least show pancreatitis). The MRI also shows an abnormality around the liver consistent with blood. Sure enough, Megan starts to bleed out both ends and is rushed to surgery with multiple sources of internal bleeding. Watching the surgery, House notices that Megan has an enlarged uterus. He enters the OR and takes a look, realizing that Megan has had a recent abortion. He then hypothesizes that she has been taking birth control pills, which when combined with the Warfarin (a blood thinner) she has been on since hip surgery (which would have been nice to know earlier), led to her bleeding (The effect, if any, oral contraceptives have on Warfarin is not clear. The combination probably does slightly increase the risk of bleeding, so House may be right. Of course, every other medication mentioned in this episode including MAO inhibitors, ethanol, cephalosporins, tamoxifen, and antipyretics also increase the chance of bleeding while on Warfarin, only moreso). House puts her on Tamoxifen to block the effects of the birth control pills (this is not a recommended use of Tamoxifen). This revelation that Megan had an abortion is too much for her boyfriend, who leaves the hospital, but he return later to sit by her side.The bleeding improves, but now Megan develops kidney failure and breathing problems. Her fever returns. House wanders the ER looking for a doctor to bounce ideas off, but discovers that Cuddy has put out a memo prohibiting anyone from talking with him. One young resident decides ignore the memo and talk with him anyway. At first she suggests a fungal infection or haemophilus infection, but House rules these out. She then mentions Crush Syndrome (which House states wouldnt explain the breathing problems) and ARDS (Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome which House complains would only explain the breathing problems). House rethinks the differential diagnoses, and now concludes that the patient is suffering from both Crush Syndrome and ARDS, which is bad news for Megan since these conditions have a poor prognosis. As he is talking with her mother and boyfriend, he notices a large lump in her arm. An MRI shows multiple similar lumps scattered throughout the body which are shown to be Eosinophilic Granulomas, which they say is a sign of an allergic reaction (I dont know what they are referring to here. Eosinophilic Granuloma is a type of Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis, a rare disease that has nothing to so with allergies. Im wondering if they are confusing it with feline eosinophilic granuloma, a very different condition.) Apparently Megan is allergic to the antibiotics she was given in the hospital medications which she has taken before without any problem. Finally, House realizes the solution to this patients problems she isnt Megan. Both Megan and a similarly appearing girl named Liz survived the explosion. There was a mistaken identification and Megan was identified as Liz and vice versa. Megan died several days ago, and the patient House has been treating is Liz whose medical records confirm everything House has suspected including the antidepressants, abortion, and use of birth control pills.", "episode_7": "Chase begins surgery on a physically deformed teenager but has to stop the operation when the teen has issues on the table.

House knew something must be wrong with the man. There was. More on that later. After some initial introductions and some particularly distracting camera work that had the characters talking directly into the camera as the audience experienced the point of view of the character that character was speaking to. (Told you it was distracting ... and confusing). After meeting the too-nice guy, House wondered if he was Canadian. He wasn't. He was sick, so it was time to figure out why.The team debated over whether the patient's niceness was actually a symptom. This started some discussion about whether everyone is on a bell curve of niceness where most people fall somewhere in the middle, but the extremes on either end would be House and this guy who's too nice. House thought the niceness was a symptom.While bowling with Chase -- that's right, Chase -- House talked about how he felt like he was losing touch with his best friend Wilson since Wilson started dating Amber. Chase's wisdom gave House the idea to propose \"joint custody\" of Wilson to Amber. They decided it was a reasonable suggestion, although Wilson stayed out of the discussion because he's afraid of both of them. They turned to Cuddy for the final word on the arrangement, but she wouldn't offer her judgment until House promised to complete performance reviews for the doctors on his team.Back to the patient, House decided the man had Williams Syndrome, which meant he was missing the genes that make him suspicious. That only addressed the niceness that House was concerned about, but the other symptoms didn't fit. And, since this was just 13 minutes into the episode, it couldn't have been the final diagnosis. Cue: the patient having a seizure.House decided the team should test the man for neuro-syphilis, and that opened an ginormous can of worms. The patient said it was a waste of time because he didn't have syphilis and he didn't believe his wife would cheat on him. His syphilis test came back positive and it made the man's wife wonder if he's really as nice as he seems or if she's been in love with a symptom for years. This led Kutner to believe in his bell curve idea and gave him the idea to test House's blood for syphilis, thinking it could be impacting his behavior, just in the opposite way.When Foreman became outraged that House was avoiding giving the doctors their performance reviews, he volunteered to do them, which was exactly what House wanted. But when he tried to give Thirteen a performance review, she cut him off and walked out of the office. Taub later had a similar reaction and told Foreman that House was tricking him into thinking he had authority as a way to prove he has none. Taub said House knew the doctors would stand up to Foreman and let him know he wasn't superior, which would put him in his place. House essentially admitted that he set up Foreman so that the rest of the team would see him as an equal.On his play date with Wilson, House tried to get his buddy drunk in order to prompt him to get into a fight with Amber later that night. Wilson didn't like that and went home. Amber wasn't happy that House returned Wilson to her drunk and insisted on a penalty. They agreed to come up with penalties later.Kutner's test for syphilis on House's blood came back positive, and the team wondered whether the diagnosis and treatment would alter House's behavior and temper his medical prowess. They got together and told House, but he said nothing. They gave him medicine for it. They then sat around with Chase and Cameron to discuss it all and wondered whether the syphilis made House who he is, and Chase asked Cameron if she'd slept with House. She didn't answer, saying it's none of the other doctors' business, and none of Chase's business. She never did answer and kept defending House.As the team treated the patient with drugs his behavior changed and he went from being too nice to being overly mean, then had a heart attack. The team discussed the new development until House put Foreman on the spot and agreed with Foreman's suggestion. The team wondered if House was already changing because they were treating his syphilis. But he told Wilson that he made it all up and planted a blood sample that he knew they would test. Wilson, of course, told Amber and she told Kutner and Taub.Knowing that House didn't have syphilis, Kutner surmised that the patient also didn't have syphilis. He figured out that the man had a Costa Rican parasite that presented a positive test for syphilis. House was impressed. The parasite was treatable and the man appeared to get better, actually admitting a dislike for ketchup.With the case figured out, House handed Cuddy a stack of performance reviews but they were all the same -- except for one. It was for her. House slammed Cuddy's ability as a doctor and got personal. \"What you want, you run away from. What you need, you don't have a clue. What you've accomplished makes you proud. But you're still miserable.\" He asked her to sign it. Cuddy told House that both he and Amber are \"losing fingers\" for breaching their custody contract over Wilson.

He knew immediately that he'd lost some memory and eventually noticed that he was bleeding from a gash on his head. He didn't remember much, but he was sure he had to save someone's life.It didn't take long before House was recounting the fact that he'd been on a bus when it crashed, but he was still having troubling recalling several hours from the previous night. He knew he had to save someone who was on the bus, so he began wildly checking everyone who'd been on the bus for any possible symptoms. He went so far as to announce that a patient had meningitis so he shut the emergency room down and check everyone. He quickly suspected the bus driver had a seizure, and he was right -- sort of.House looked at hospital security camera footage and any other clues he could find to trigger his memory. Kutner suggested medical hypnosis and Chase just so happened to have had some training back in Australia. The hypnosis sent House into a bizarre world of memory and hallucination that included seeing visions of Amber in a bar. Wilson was with House as he recalled these memories and House nearly told Wilson that he wanted to see Amber naked in his fantasy. But he didn't. After that, House saw some of passengers' faces from the bus, including one of a mysterious woman who caught House's eye. After misdiagnosing a goth kid who'd been on the bus, House went back to the bus driver, who suffered sudden paralysis.While conducting an MRI on House, Wilson asked him what he'd been hiding from his vision of Amber. House finally told Wilson it was that he wanted to see Amber naked, which didn't surprise Wilson because House wants to see everyone naked. The fact that House didn't objectify Amber in his fantasy gave Wilson a warning that House had feelings for Amber. \"This is bad,\" Wilson said.House became obsessed to the point of endangering his own life, due to his cracked skull, in his quest to save whomever it was from the bus that he was trying to save. But he didn't know why.House submerged himself in a bath to deprive his senses in yet another effort to recapture some memory. This is where it got interesting. He slipped into a fantasy that included Cuddy doing pole dancing and doing a strip tease while they discussed possible diagnoses for the patient. That was, umm, different. The bus driver appeared in the hallucination, offering up some diagnoses of his own, and the mystery woman showed up, as well, when House was yanked from his bath and sent home with a nurse and security guard. He continued to lead the team in treating the guy over the phone until Cuddy finally asked him to return to the hospital.House noticed caps on the bus driver's teeth and thought he might have had an air bubble enter his gums during recent dental work. He locked himself in the man's hospital room with Thirteen while Cuddy, Foreman, Kutner and Taub watched helplessly. House wanted Thirteen to stab the guy's heart to get the air bubble out. With Cuddy shouting at Thirteen, calling her Dr. Hadley, Thirteen jammed a syringe into the man's chest and saved him.Cuddy went home with House, but only to make sure he didn't do anything stupid. She slept in the living room while he stayed in his room. But a middle-of-the-night dream brought the mystery woman back to House and gave him some clues to solving the real puzzle he had yet to figure out. She had a necklace charm, a red scarf that he was meant to tie around her. As he did it, she said, \"I'm cold,\" and House replied, \"Stay with me,\" without knowing why. House woke up knowing that the mystery of the real person he was trying to save was still unresolved. The bus driver's air bubble was just a coincidence and was actually the result of the bus crash, not the cause of it.House staged the scene inside the bus using nurses and doctors from the hospital to represent passengers. Meanwhile, he tossed back pills that are meant for Alzheimer's patients to help charge up his brain. Cuddy and Wilson worried the pills could make his brain go into overdrive and blow up his heart. The scene went dark and House saw the mystery woman again. She told him she was providing clues to the real mystery. It turned out, her necklace was made of amber, which triggered his memory of Amber being on the bus at the time of the crash. He relived the crash and saw Amber tossed around in the bus. She had a metal pole lodged in her leg. After the crash, he saw Amber and tied a red scarf around her leg. \"I'm cold,\" she told him. \"Stay with me,\" he said. Then he lost consciousness and the next thing he saw was a medic carrying Amber out of the bus.House's heart stopped from all the drugs he'd taken, and when he came to he said, \"Amber.\" He told Wilson Amber was on the bus. Wilson realized he hadn't spoken to her since the crash and Thirteen confirmed that \"Jane Doe #2\" had a birthmark on her right shoulder blade, which Amber does. House told Wilson Amber was on the bus with him and \"she's the one who's dying.\"", "episode_5": "A man walking down the street is mugged and starts coughing and wheezing during the attack. As he falls to his knees in respiratory distress, one of the muggers feels bad enough to call for an ambulance (but not bad enough to return his wallet). The patient, who identifies himself as Martin Harris, is admitted to Houses team for evaluation of his respiratory collapse.The initial differential diagnosis includes asthma (not supported by the x-ray), food allergy (no skin findings), and pulmonary embolism (a blood clot in the lungs but radiology studies were normal). Foreman suggests laryngospasm (a sudden tightening of the vocal cords) as a diagnosis. Though he is not happy about Foreman being present, he recognizes that his suggestion has merit and orders a methacholine challenge. The test is negative, though now the patient complains of numbness in his extremities and abdominal pain. The differential diagnosis now consists of dissecting aortic aneurysm, a spinal cord lesion, or multiple marantic emboli (clots from growths on the heart valves). None of them seem to fit the symptoms well, but the team is interrupted mid-discussion with the news that the patient has had a syncopal episode and collapsed.As they are evaluating Martin, Foreman begins to suspect Munchausens Syndrome because the patient borrowed the name of one of the paramedics and his new symptoms match the exact symptoms of his neighbors. House, instead, suspects Giovannis Giovanninis Mirror Syndrome, where a patient who has lost his memory mimics those he sees around him. House brings Martin into the operating room where Wilson is performing a procedure. Sure enough, Martin begins to mimic Wilson, confirming the Mirror Syndrome diagnosis.A short time later, House and the team notice that Martin has a lace-like rash over his arms and legs (livedo reticularis), which House decides is due to cold agglutinins (antibodies that clot in the cold, blocking capillaries and blood flow) caused by infection. Blood cultures are ordered as well as an ultrasound. House sends Dr. 13 and Big Love to search for the patients car to find out who he really is. A solid liver lesion turns up on the ultrasound the thought is either an abscess or a vascular hemangioma (a clump of dilated capillaries). Frat Guy performs a needle aspiration and gets a dark substance he believes is pus. He suggests that Martin has a tropical fungal infection and the patient is started on Amphotericin. The livedo reticularis returns and Martin is placed in a heated whirlpool. The Amphotericin does not help and what was felt to be pus ends up just being coagulated blood. The differential remains infection, but most likely viral or some rare bacteria. Because the patient has no memory, they cant get a good history, but House suggests they run antibody tests on Martins blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) because this will give them some idea what diseases hes been exposed to in the past and a general idea of where he is from and where hes been. His antibodies are high for histoplasmosis (common in the Ohio River Valley) and weak for coccidiomycosis (found in the San Joaquin Valley) and Chagas Disease (common in Mexico and Central and South America).The livedo reticularis has returned despite aggressive hot water baths. House starts Martin on lipopolysaccharide (a toxin found on the cell wall of certain infectious bacteria) to induce a fever to raise his temperature and keep his blood flowing. While in the tub, Martin goes into cardiac arrest. Kumar defibrillates Martin before he is completely dry. This returns Martin to a normal heart rhythm, but also knocks Kumar out.House orders a re-check of the blood cultures and Foreman recommends a heart biopsy. As Dr. 13 completes the heart biopsy, Kumar drops a hint to House that Martin regained some of his old memories while in the hot tub. Taking the items found in the patients car by Big Love and Dr. 13, House pretends to be Robert Elliot (the patients real name) in an attempt to jog the patients memory. With the help of vaporub, he succeeds and discovers that Robert/Martin is a traveling farm equipment salesman and has developed an Eperythrozoon infection from pig feces (a type of bacteria found in certain animals, including pigs and ruminants.

While in the simulator, she experiences a sudden episode of synasthesia a neurological condition where the senses get their wires crossed, and one can hear vision or taste sounds and crashes. She wants to find and fix what is wrong with her, but doesnt want NASA to know, so she offers House $50,000 to admit her and solve her case off the books.House, meanwhile, has 40 applicants for his three underling positions. He presents Gretas case to them but tells them that no records can be kept of her stay. Under questioning from the group, Greta reports that the symptoms are new and shes never had similar episodes before. She has no psychiatric history and is on no medications of any kind. She does admit to doing a lot of flying as one student suspects that the prolonged immobility from flying has led her to develop deep vein thromboses (clots) of the legs, which are breaking apart and traveling through her circulatory system and a PFO (patent foramen ovale, an abnormal hole in the heart) and causing strokes, which caused her synasthesia. House orders an EEG, MRI, angiogram, and lumbar puncture, as well as a whole battery of lab tests. He also sends a trio of applicants to search her house.The radiology studies are all normal, and the only significant blood abnormality is an elevated red blood cell count. The inspection of Gretas apartment revealed a broken fireplace flu flue. The suspicion now is that she has developed carbon monoxide poisoning and she is placed in a hyperbaric chamber (a high pressure chamber that will drive the carbon monoxide out of her cells and replace it with oxygen). As she is getting set-up for the chamber, Greta develops tachycardia (an abnormally fast heart rate), tachypnea (an abnormally fast respiratory rate), low blood pressure, and passes out. The applicants start a code, providing CPR and code medications (but did they check a pulse before beginning CPR?). When the monitors show her to be in ventricular fibrillation, one of the applicants defibrillates her. It restores her to a normal heart rhythm, but also starts a fire in the oxygen-rich environment of the hyperbaric chamber. The fire is put out, and Greta is started on nitroglycerin and blood thinners (heparin, probably) for a suspected heart attack.With symptoms now consisting of synasthesia, increased red blood cell count, and a heart attack, House throws the case to the applicants again. They suggest Takayasus Arteritis(inflammation of the aorta and other large arteries) and Whipples Disease (a rare bowel disease which doesnt seem to fit at all). An older applicant makes a good case for cardiomyopathy (a heart condition that leads to weakening of the heart muscle), and a transeosphageal echocardiogram is ordered (an echocardiogram that looks at the heart through the esophagus it provides better images of certain parts of the heart, particularly the valves. Frankly, a regular echocardiogram should have been sufficient, but then we would have missed the reveal and character moment at the end). The echo reveals a structurally normal heart, but brief episodes of an irregular rhythm: atrial flutter. A thyroid problem is now the suspect, and a TRH stimulation test (an old and rarely used thyroid test) is ordered. As the test is administered, Gretas heart rate and BP rise and she complains of feeling warm. She suffers another synasthesia episode as well as a psychotic break (or panic attack, depending on whom you listen to). She runs into a conference room and locks the door. She is persuaded to come out (threatened, really), and sedated but not before Cuddy realizes something is going on.The thyroid results were normal, so one of the applicants suggests a liver problem more specifically: liver cancer with an associated paraneoplastic syndrome. The difficulty is that the Cuddy wont let them run any more tests without the patients name on them, and the patient wont allow her name to be used. House has to figure out how to diagnose Greta without running standard tests. An applicant suggests loading Greta with intravenous Vitamin D and placing her on a tanning bed (because Vitamin D requires sunlight to function effectively and is metabolized in the liver but it would take a huge dose of Vitamin D to accomplish this ) while another suggests giving her tequila to see how much alcohol her liver can tolerate. Unsurprisingly, House goes with the tequila option. While Houses team is administering the test, Greta develops severe shortness of breath. She wont let the team intubate her or give her oxygen because it will show up in the records. Listening to her lungs, House detects a mass and suspects she has lung cancer. Greta refuses a biopsy because it will leave a scar. One of the applicants, a plastic surgeon, suggests giving Greta a cosmetic procedure to explain away the scars, and performing a lung biopsy during the procedure. Reluctantly, Great agrees to a breast augmentation. The surgical lung examination reveals multiple cysts within her lungs. The diagnosis now includes Alveolar Hydadtid Disease (a parasitic disease caused by tiny tapeworms) and pulmonary Langerhans (a disease caused by a proliferation of a line of abnormal cells, in this case in the lungs), but none of them quite fit the case. Chase appears in the gallery and suggests Von Hipple-Lindau disease (a rare genetic disease that causes tumors and cysts to grow throughout the body) with a pheochromacytoma (a tumor that releases high levels of adrenalin and similar compounds, it can be associated with certain types of Von Hippel-Lindau). The Von Hippel-Lindau explains the masses and increased red blood cells, while the pheochromocytoma explains the cardiac and neurological symptoms. The cysts and tumors are removed, but Greta is cautioned that Von Hippel-Lindau is a genetic disease and they could recur at any time. House tells Greta that he has reported her situation to NASA, but it turns out that he is lying and he only told her that to stop the applicants from reporting it to NASA themselves. In the end he picks his applicants, confronts Cameron in the ER (where she now works), and accuses one of the applicants (correctly) of not being a doctor, but hires him anyway as an assistant."}, "season_2": {"episode_3": "Cuddy pushes her asthmatic handyman Alfredo to continue working.

Wilson isn't convinced, since having watched the transformation of hundreds of dying patients, he doesn't \"believe we're just a bag of chemicals.\"With House not around, the team goes with epilepsy as its next guess.Derrick's girlfriend is upset. He never told her about the voices. He breaks up with her.After Derrick's test, Adams asks about voices. He tells her his brother was killed by a drunk driver, and his father ended up drinking himself into oblivion because of it. Their father moved away and her mother hid all the pictures of Christopher. All of a sudden, Derrick can't see out of his right eye. It is a clot in the artery.House brings Wilson to lunch in the hospital cafeteria. It is filled with former patients Wilson has saved. But quickly Wilson figures out they are others posing as the patients. House is attempting to con him into doing the chemo.Taub tells Foreman he thinks House is imploding. Water starts seeping from under the bathroom door. House hints he may have flushed the season tickets.Wilson is at lunch when he is joined by Thirteen at his request. He asks her about the human response to mortality. He tells her he wants to spend his remaining months with \"family and friends.\"House is trying to get Wilson's parents on the phone to convince Wilson to keep on living.There continues to be problems with the plumbing.Park gives Derrick a spinal tap and asks about hearing his brother's voice. His pressure is way too high.Thirteen goes to see House. She tells him firing her so she could spend the rest of her life doing what she wants was an unselfish act.House tells Wilson he's been a \"disloyal, disrespectful jerk\" and wants them to go out for dinner.Derrick's mother arrives at the hospital. When he asks her about Christopher, she immediately leaves to get coffee.Wilson and House have a great dinner, catching up on old times. Wilson starts to think about doing the chemo, then thinks he's being tricked. House eventually admits he needs Wilson and wants him to be around. This upsets Wilson, because their entire relationship has been about House: \"My dying is about me.\"In the parking lot, Wilson weeps in his car. House sits in the passenger seat. Wilson says he needs his friend to be with him and tells him he loves him. House says he won't do it unless Wilson fights.During an MRI, the entire ceiling falls on top of Derrick, Park and Adams.House arrives at the hospital to find everything a mess. The team gives him grief because his prank damaged the MRI and put them in danger. They tell him Derrick doesn't have a migraine, but thought Park was Adams. House grabs a needle and rushes to Derrick's room. He draws blood out of Derrick's right ear and tells his team he has persistent stapedial artery, a rare congenital vascular anomaly presenting as a pulsatile middle ear mass. It's been pressing against part of brain, explaining all of his symptoms.Taub follows House down the hallway and tells him that Wilson doesn't want to live in pain. House screams at him \"life is pain\" and points out he lives every day of his life in pain.The next day Park tells House that Derrick's surgery has been delayed because he drank ammonia, likely since he doesn't want to live without his brother's voice. House goes into the room and wraps a tube around Derrick's neck yelling at him his responsibility is to live. Park hits House in the back with his cane, staggering him and causing him to loosen his grip. She yells at him \"sometimes the truth just sucks.\"Wilson tells Foreman he's going to be leaving in the next few days. He tells him House isn't his child and he can't be held responsible for him. Foreman stops him and says over 20 years House has been his only constant and wonders if enduring the pain of chemo for his pal is what life is all about.Derrick's mother admits she removed his photo of his brother. He asks if she'll bring it back if he gets the surgery.Wilson stops by House's place. He says he's ready to start the next round of chemo because \"you need me and I don't think that's a bad thing anymore.\" House says he thinks it's time for him to accept Wilson is smarter than he is. He's not okay with Wilson only having five months left, \"but it's better than nothing.\"Derrick says he knows his surgery worked, \"because Christopher's gone.\" His mother gives him a folder full of photos of his brother.Foreman brings the hospital's lawyer to see House. The police are charging him with felony vandalism for clogging the sewage pipe which led to the destruction of the MRI. His parole his been revoked and he needs to report to prison the following day to complete the rest of his sentence . . . six months.", "episode_13": "Open with a 38-year old man named Joe giving a seminar called \"Marriage Rescue.\" He collapses on stage.House (Hugh Laurie) tells the team most of Joe's tests came back normal. He spiked a fever and collapsed. House has some fun at the expense of Joe's theory of getting men to act more like women. The plan is to start with a D-dimer test. House tells the team he's searching for somebody to fill Foreman's \"team leader\" job.House's wife Dominika (Karolina Wydra) shows up at the hospital. She tells him the green card interview with immigration in coming up in four days. House doesn't seem thrilled with the idea of lying to the government. She responds. She will make him an offer he can't refuse.Joe used to be a corporate coach. He tells them he changed his philosophy after being beat up over a sports argument by three men. He realized he was sacrificing his health for no good reason. The final piece of the puzzle was meeting wife Marlene who helped give him a new direction, including diet.Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) thinks House is a fool if he tries to help Dominika and risk going back to jail. House says she offered him $30,000 to help her.Joe's test came back normal. House tells them team leader comes with a $50 per week raise. When House learns of Joe's fight, he takes them to his room.Joe tells House he was kneed in the groin several times during the fight. When Joe doesn't look at Adams' (or Chase's) butt when she bends over, he diagnoses a low level of testosterone.A blood test confirms House's theory. Marlene seems intrigued when Taub (Peter Jacobson) says the testosterone will increase Joe's sex drive. Just after Taub gives him the injection, Joe wets his pants.The incontinence issues means Joe's issue is likely neurological. House is having difficulty recalling any of Dominika's family history. The team leader position is shaping up to be a competition between Park (Charlyne Yi), Adams (Odette Annable) and Chase (Jesse Spencer). They decide to run a few tests for multiple sclerosis.Chase talks about seniority mattering for the position. Taub thinks what House wants is for them to fight over it.During his lumbar puncture, Joe says he's worried about how he feels after taking the testosterone. He's concerned if his great life change was just chemical.Chase wants Foreman (Omar Epps) to drop the team leader idea. Foreman thinks structure could help.Dominika begins putting some of her stuff at House's place. She is a big fan of dance aerobics. Park drops by to help House study for the interview.Chase and Taub talk about masculinity while watching Joe's clean MRI. Joe begins having double vision.While House takes pictures with Dominika in front of a green screen, Taub suggests Myasthenia gravis. House likes the diagnosis. After the team leaves, Taub meets with House to tell him the search for a No. 2 is a mistake. House makes fun of him.Joe tells Adams he feels great and immediately makes a comment about Marlene's rear end looking good. He then makes a decision about a business idea he'd been putting off.Park's tutoring seems to have paid off. Wilson wonders if House might now know too much about Dominika's life to be believable.Park makes a comment about Chase wanting to be the team leader because he needs the money. They notice what appears to be jaundice in Joe's eyes.The liver problems put the team back at square one. Park thinks Lyme disease. House goes with it.Joe has shifted their business in order to give Marlene a salary bump. This was something they had previously agreed was a bad idea. Marlene looks concerned.An immigration agent named Weinmann pays House and his \"wife\" a visit.Chase tells Marlene to \"give him time,\" since he's basically going through puberty. She shows Chase a video from a seminar before she knew him. Joe was pretty much an Alpha Male. She says she never would have dated somebody like that.Weinmann seems happy with what he hears from House and Dominika, but needs to get a \"corroborating statement\" from a neighbor. He knocks on a door across the hall. Wilson answers using a British accent. Just before Weinmann can leave, the actual resident of the apartment shows up and busts Wilson. Weinmann glares at House and says \"be in my office tomorrow at 10.\"House talks to the team from the lobby at the immigration office. The antibiotics aren't working yet. Wilson calls him and suggests he throw Dominika under the bus.Adams walks in on Joe and Marlene arguing. He wants her to step aside and \"let me be the man in this relationship.\" She leaves. He sounds conflicted. Adams looks down at his food plate and says she wants to do another test.Weinmann is ready to deport Dominika and tell House's parole officer he engaged in fraud. But Dominika makes an impassioned plea. Even if she can't stay in the country, House shouldn't go back to jail. She says she loves him. Weinmann basically gives them another chance, saying he will have them investigated regularly for six months. House looks stunned. In the hall, she admits it was for show.Adams performs a test indicating Taub's earlier theory about Celiac was correct. They get a page. Joe is having trouble breathing.This new system leaves the team without a good answer for their now-dying patient. There is a suggestion of Strongyloides, based on Joe having recently traveled to Puerto Rico. The treatment is dangerous if they're wrong. A subdued House gives the go-ahead.A\nHouse watches one of the old Joe seminar videos over Taub's shoulder. Taub notices his voice seems deeper than it is now. This gives House an idea.House tells Joe he has silent thyroiditis, which is a symptom of Type III Polyglandular Autoimmune Syndrome. He would have developed Celiac if it wasn't for the gluten-free diet. Once he started eating gluten, things got worse. He should be fine after a steroid treatment but the testosterone is still necessary.House tells the team since nobody \"won,\" they will now compete for the position with a doctoring competition.Joe asks Taub about taking a much lower dosage of testosterone in order to save his marriage and career. Taub tells him there are health risks associated with low testosterone. He says he'll chance it.While watching the rest of the team competing, Taub says \"I'll split the extra 50 with you.\" House says \"deal.\"House comes home to find Dominika working out. He pauses before saying, \"Honey I'm home.\"", "episode_5": "At a small town festival, popular local businessman Bob Harrison receives an award for being a pillar of the community. That night we cut to Bob having a heart attack while having sex with a young woman who .Foreman welcomes back Chase and Taub. He wants them to spy for him, saying its to help House keep out of prison.Taub and Chase join Park and Adams for their first meeting. Bob is telling people he had the heart attack while working. House isn't buying it. House lets the new girls know about Taub having children with two different women, and his guess one or both of them aren't his.Bob admits to Chase and Adams he started feeling lightheaded while cheating on his wife. Chase tells his wife they're giving him a stress test.Wilson tries (unsuccessfully) to keep from House the fact he's sitting for Taub's babies.House brings Taub's kids into the stress test and want to DNA test them to make sure they're his. Chase brings Bob's wife in to try and make him feel nervous during the test. Eventually, he falls off the treadmill and they see it's not his heart after all -- he's having a seizure.House suggests a type of epilepsy as Bob's condition and orders tests.Foreman expresses concern to Wilson that House has been behaving badly recently.During his test, Bob talks about how miserable he has been.House next goes with phaeochromocytoma as a guess for Bob's condition. He has Chase and Adams perform the test. Taub and Park go to the motel where Bob was cheating.Chase and Adams begin to talk about their personal lives. Adams notices something on Bob's neck, perhaps a tumor, when she goes to adjust the monitoring device.Based on bacteria found at the hotel, House thinks Bob has a different kind of syndrome and orders surgery. He's still trying to snap a sample of Taub's DNA.Bob says he wants to tell his wife the truth prior to the operation. Taub tells Park in the hallway he doesn't think it's a good idea. Bob's wife seems ready to forgive.Wilson tells Taub that House has started a hospital-wide betting pool regarding which kids are his.During Bob's surgery, they find the bulge is actually tissue. They take a biopsy sample and his liver starts to fail.Bob's biopsy was clear. House wants to them to treat him with a broad spectrum antibiotic after he gets a donor liver.Chase wants Bob's wife and her friends and family to get tested to be a partial liver donor. Bob tells his wife the only way he'll let anyone get tested is if he tells them about his infidelity. Bob's wife doesn't like the idea.Virtually Bob's entire hometown arrives at the hospital. He tells them he had an affair. She says she forgives him, then Bob begins to admitting to having cheated most of the town by charging them for auto repair work they didn't need. He also gambled away $10,000 of a college scholarship fund.Only two citizens stick around and neither are matches. The team debates truth. With time short, House recommends taking out the damaged part of Bob's liver.Taub performs the DNA test himself.Adams and Chase are stunned to see Bob's liver appears to be healing itself.Bob's liver function has improved by 30 percent since he's begun confessing. House wants them to find the girl he had the affair with and see what triggered his initial attack.The girl Bob slept with tells Adams and Chase if the town found it was her, she'll lose her job.Bob's wife is done with him, he says. While testing him for allergies, Bob's skin breaks out when Park touches him with the wheat sample.Bob is not allergic to wheat, or anything else. Foreman catches Taub looking at monkey DNA -- House manipulated him into checking the DNA, then switched out the samples to mess with him.Bob's skin appears literally to be peeling right off.Park thinks Bob probably has Stevens-Johnson syndrome, an untreatable condition that fits all of the symptoms and only gets worse with treatment. House agrees and sends everybody home.Bob tells Chase he killed his business partner and made it look like suicide. He also killed \"three or four\" other people. This gives Chase an idea.Chase shows the team Bob has a neurological disorder causing him to take responsibility for everything. But since no neurological disorder causes your skin to fall off, House thinks he has Kawasaki's disease. He thinks Bob could have gotten it from the carpet cleaner at the motel.Taub prevents House from shredding the DNA results, then does it himself to make sure all copies are destroyed. House seems surprised.Bob's wife returns to the hospital. There was no money missing from the scholarship fund. She knows he has a disease that makes him admit to crimes he didn't commit. He tells her he would never and has never cheated on her. She cries with happiness.The team all has martinis when House unveils the new office rebuild. It appears nothing has changed, until House hits a button and the entire wall separating them from Wilson's office raises.", "episode_11": "Open with images of a disheveled hospital room. Blood is everywhere. We see a scalpel on the ground and a bloody handprint on the wall.House (Hugh Laurie) sits down with a man named Cofield (Jeffrey Wright). He's a neurosurgeon at another hospital there to evaluate an incident. House realizes he was Foreman's former mentor.The case in question was a 32-year old chemistry teacher who collapsed while jogging and has no feeling in his extremities.House tells Cofield about Vicodin and tells him it's been part of the process. House says \"bad things sometimes happen. It's nobody's fault.\"We learn more about the case as Cofield interviews the rest of the team. House orders a round of steroids an beta blockers.Cofield notices orange smudges on the file. House admits to dying Chase's hair bright orange. House put dye in Adams' shampoo, which Chase (Jesse Spencer) used.The team found out Bill (David Anders) was hit by an explosion during an experiment in class. The team didn't find out about it until he woke up. Some of his students show up at the hospital and say it was a student's attempt at creating a viral video. Bill then begins coughing up blood.The explosion video shows Bill's head hitting the wall. Based on this information, House decided to order treatment with aerosolized heparin. This decision came as a gas mask-wearing House tortured the team with a stink bomb Chase had placed in his office.Cofield thinks House was torturing his team to come up with a diagnosis. Park (Charlyne Yi) tells him she went to Foreman (Omar Epps) who thought the heparin treatment was a mistake. Cofield speaks with Foreman, who admits if House gets in trouble, he'll probably lose his job. Cofield tells him he won't give him any preferential treatment.The team notices a rash on Bill's body. Park, Adams (Odette Annable) and Taub (Peter Jacobson) all have slightly different interpretation of what the rash means. House's response was to order high-dose steroids, which gave them the best chance of finding out what is wrong. Two of the three outcomes involve Bill getting worse before he gets better.Cofield asks House if he still thinks that was the best course of action \"in light of what happened.\" House says yes, since he decision did not account for the disobedience of his own team.We learn Chase agreed with Adams, who wanted to biopsy the rash. This causes Bill to freak out and get into a huge fight with Chase.Back to Cofield asking House who he blames for what happened.After Bill is wrestled back into bed, we see a scalpel is sticking out of Chase's chest. He drops to the floor. Adams ends up sticking a finger into his heart to keep him from bleeding out.Adams tells Cofield she is to blame.They take Chase into surgery and are able to get the wound stabilized. At this point, House begins asking about Bill and wants Park to come with him. The team is stunned. House leaves himself.Taub admits House was being callous, but it wasn't an issue. He allows Chase may have been to blame for bringing a scalpel into a room with a patient they thought capable of having a psychotic episode.House goes into the room and finds a readout of Bill's heart rate. He then goes to Chase's bedside and starts asking more questions. The team doesn't want to help with Chase still lying there. Chase wakes up and tells them he can't feel his legs.Cofield goes to see Chase in recovery. He asks who was at fault. Chase wants to know why it matters. He doesn't think what happened to him was anybody's fault. He credits House for the possibility of him being able to walk again.Flash to House coming up with a possible fixable explanation for Chase not being able to feel his legs. During the procedure on Chase, House walks in and asks the team about Bill.Cofield can't believe House would have done that. Chase tells him it was House's way of checking on him, since he knew the team wouldn't leave and had already decided how to treat Bill. At this point, Cofield notices Chase's toes moving. He can feel his feet. Cofield says he should be able to get back \"at least some of the function.\" Chase tells Cofield that he would take the scalpel risk again. Cofield says \"I thought so,\" and says the reason he brazenly defied his boss is because House has created a situation promoting recklessness.During his last round of questions with Cofield, House pulls out his Vicodin. The cap explodes. This gives House an idea about Bill. He gets up and leaves.House is not allowed access to Bill, because Foreman is having him transferred to another hospital. But he manges to find Bill's wife and tells her that her husband has a tumor in his lymph nodes. The explosion caused the cancer cells to break open. The psychotic break was causes by the team's treatment. House says it's treatable. She must tell his new doctors.The entire team sits down for a meeting with Cofield. He says House is \"brilliant\" and a \"fiasco.\" Bill's wife interrupts the proceedings to say House was right about her husband having a tumor, adding \"he saved my husband's life.\" Cofield continues, saying he would be doing the hospital a disservice if he changed House's process. He says the stabbing was \"nobody's fault.\" House calls him a coward and yells at him before leaving the room.We see Chase in rehab. He tells him the orange hair was a way of telling Chase not to be late. House tells him Cofield decided the stabbing was nobody's fault. He says \"They were wrong. I'm sorry.\"", "episode_1": "We open with House at a parole hearing. It's been a year since he drove his car through Cuddy's house and he's been in jail for some time. He'll get his parole after five more in prison days but is warned that if he commits the slightest infraction he's back in for four more months.MONDAYHouse wakes up next to his scary-looking roommate. In the med line we learn the roommate, Asofa, is homicidal and taking antipsychotics. House is giving gang leader Mendelson his Vicodin.A prisoner named Nick tells House he's having strange pain in his elbows and knees.A prisoner named Rollo is stealing House's stuff, realizing that with only days left on his sentence he won't do anything. An inmate named Frankie who appears to be a buddy of House's thinks the best payback will be House getting out.An enormous inmate named Stomper said he wants House's stereo and headphones.In the infirmary House corrects a young female doctor named Jessica as she misdiagnoses Nick. The older doctor Sykes tells her who House was on the outside. House thinks Nick has lupus.House hides his stereo and headphones in Rollo's cell, then tells Stomper Rollo took them from his cell after House brought them to him.TUESDAYA cricket chirps in the room. Just before House flicks it Asofa indicates it's a pet.House searches Nick for a rash that would indicate his lupus diagnosis was correct.House tells Jessica he found a rash on Nick's thigh. She figured out who he is and he doesn't correct her when she guesses he's there for forging prescriptions. House guesses exactly who she is based on numerous tiny observations.Mendelson has discovered House is on \"short time.\" His Vicodin tax has gone up and somehow House must find a way to give Mendelson 20 pills (more than he'll be allotted) by the end of the week. If House chooses to go the protective custody route Mendelson has people who will get to him on the outside.House asks another prisoner about getting him the extra pills. All of a sudden Nick is having incredible arm pain after getting jostled. This means it's not lupus.WEDNESDAYWithout being able to take his meds, House is having severe pain. Asofa's cricket is sick and he wants House to fix it.House tells Jessica Nick could have lung cancer. She can x-ray him in a few days but House doesn't think that's quick enough.House asks Frankie to find him a replacement cricket. Frankie mentions how many pesticides are sprayed outside the prison.House won't be able to get extra Vicodin from the prisoner he talked to earlier.House listens to Nick's chest and is able to find an abnormality he thinks is a tumor. Jessica cuts Nick's ear to see what the reaction is after a few minutes. While they wait House tells Jessica he's thinking about going into physics when he gets out. She thinks he shouldn't abandon his gift. Nick walks over and shows them he's got blood all over himself.THURSDAYHouse discovered the cricket had pesticide poisoning and cures Asofa's pet.No tumors showed up in Nick's X-Ray. She finally lets him look at Nick's patient file (a big no-no). Sykes walks in and sees House with the file.Jessica finds out why House is actually in prison. When she asks how he got so much time with no priors and nobody being hurt he tells her he had a bad lawyer. She is cutting him off from helping with Nick's case.Mendelson and one of his goons rough him up and remind him he has one day to get him his 20 pills.House borrows a gum wrapper and pen from Frankie. He uses them to start a fire in one of the sinks, then goes to see Jessica. When the fire alarm goes off and she turns her head he steals some pills from her desk.As House starts to tell Nick he's not interested in treating him anymore Nick goes into shock. House has to use the inside of the pen to open an airway in Nick's neck.That night House is in so much pain he takes several Vicodin pills.FRIDAYHe takes another few the pills the next morning and dumps the rest in the toilet. He asks the guard to be taken into protective custody. On the way he sees a guard drinking coffee and has an idea.He goes to the infirmary and tells Jessica and Sykes that Nick has Mastocytosis. Sykes wants to run blood tests, but House doesn't think that will be conclusive. Since Nick could die if he goes into shock without a doctor nearby House wants to give him five aspirin which should put him into shock and confirm the diagnosis. Sykes says no and has a guard escort him out, saying if he returns to the infirmary again he'll write him up.Outside Jessica tells House she realizes what is happening with Mendelson. She gives him 20 pills.In the common area House walks up to Mendelson and shows him the pills. But he tosses them into the air, starting a min-riot. Mendelson hits House several times and orders one of his goons to shank House. But right before House is stabbed Asofa comes out of nowhere and saves him, in the process beating Mendelson severely.The punches from Mendelson land House in the infirmary. When Sykes leaves the room House barricades the door and begins to crush up aspirin so he can give them to Nick. Jessica tells him he's going to end up staying in jail for six more months but House doesn't care. Just as Nick is about to drink the mixture guards come in and stop him. But once House is placed in cuffs Jessica decides to do it herself. She gives Nick the drink as Sykes tells her she'll never work as a doctor again. Nothing happens after a few seconds and House is taken away.Cut to House in solitary. A guard slips him a piece of paper. It reads: \"You were right.\"", "episode_4": "Open with a man cleaning up toilet paper and nasty signs on his lawn. The man, Barton, is the CEO of a large company that is moving overseas. His daughter drops by and its clear she's not happy the company will be leaving the country. He begins to see everything as really small and asks her to get him to a hospital.House reads Park an email from her former boss who says he's sought therapy. With her disciplinary hearing for punching him coming up, House thinks she's going to get fired. She bets him $100 that she won't. Dr. Adams stops by and suggests poisoning and Park thinks it could be thyrotoxicosis.House drops by and writes Barton a prescription. After saying he's looking for money to fund his department, House mentions that if he commits Barton it could sabotage his deal to move the company China. Barton asks \"how much?\"Barton's daughter Ainsley tells Adams she thinks her dad is moving in part because her mother died a few months earlier. Barton begins coughing up blood.House thinks Adams was at a job interview the day before. She denies it. Foreman comes in and rips up the check from Barton since it was obtained under duress.While arguing with Park and Adams, Barton begins to itch. House uses a special light to make one of the guys in the cast care department vomit. Adams wonders if maybe Barton's wife was misdiagnosed and maybe she died of cancer contracted through a virus she passed on to her husband. House orders him started on radiation.\nTo help win his bet House captures Park on tape making a comment about punching people.During radiation Barton tells Adams his wife is the only thing keeping him in America. He visits her grave weekly. Barton sounds like he's concerned with keeping his company afloat. He starts having chest pains and Adams thinks it's a heart attack.Park tells Wilson about her bet. He thinks she needs to find something he wants more than the honor of winning the bet.Adams isn't sure what happened to Barton's heart. House tells Adams that since Barton's company has lowed value since he's gone into the hospital, he wants to buy shares in the company. Adams says she'll give him $5,000 if he doubles his clinic hours.House returns to his office to find everything in his office has been put in a cast. The guy he made puke points out that if they engage in a prank war he'll just get suspended while House will get sent back to prison.House is still convinced Park will lose her job. When Park mentions that her boss had been drinking that night House observes that must mean Foreman knew about the whole thing.Armed with this information Park goes to Foreman (the chair of the disciplinary board) and threatens to tell the board about him letting her boss observe a patient after a few glasses of wine. Foreman tells her he's already told the board and been docked two weeks pay. House set her up.Adams can't find anything wrong with Barton's heart. Park asks her for a character reference. Barton starts crashing.House tells Adams he's lost her $5,000, along with $5,000 from Wilson and another $10,000. House brings them to Park's boss for a neuro consultation, seemingly to create an awkward situation. Park's boss, Andrews, thinks Barton could have normal pressure hydrocephalus, while Park thinks it's autonomic dysregulation syndrome. Andrews points out the test for ADS could put Barton into a coma if he's right. House sides with Andrews.In the hall Park tells Adams that she's not going to listen to House and wants to test for ADS.Adams runs the test. Foreman walks in and tells Adams that a $200,000 machine is missing. She covers for him. Barton suddenly doesn't respond. He appears to be in a coma.House bursts into Park's hearing and yells that he wants her fired because she disobeyed him and the patient is now in a coma. House is told to leave and Foreman asks her to continue.House tells Adams he didn't think Andrews was right. He knew she'd defy him, meaning he'd get the test he'd wanted and the $100. House doesn't want her to test for noramal pressure hydrocephalus, instead ordering a biopsy of his liver on a long shot.Park is rattled and stumbles though her statement. She basically begs to be able to keep her job.Ainsley tells Adams that unless her father wakes up by tomorrow she's going to be the one to sign the paper formally moving the company. Adams reminds her that she doesn't \"have to sign it.\"Barton's liver was fine and Andrews was also wrong. Park walks into House's office and brags that she wasn't fired and he owes her $100. House is trying to think and is annoyed by a cast being removed next door. He walks over and almost punches the guy before noticing a y-shaped screw on an X-ray. He turns to the women and orders them to put him on a plasmapheresis, confidently telling them Barton will be awake within the hour.Barton is awake. House tells him y-shapped blood vessels were causing his blood to get syrupy and shut down his organs. It was caused by his rheumatoid arthritis. House hands him a press release saying he's healthy and going back to work, along with a lease to move the company. This will help guarantee the stock returns to normal before the market opens the following day. Ainsley tells him if he moves the company she won't be involved but he signs anyway.Wilson pays House, obviously because he lost a bet he couldn't get Park to keep her job. Clearly House knew the disciplinary panel members hated him so much that his threatening to fire Park got her sympathy. House gives him $5,000.House gives Foreman back the machine. He gives him a check to start back up his department and tells him to get Chase and Taub on the phone: \"The boys are back.\" Foreman notices the check is for more than it will take to fund the department.House pages Adams to the cast room and gives her a lab coat. He says she must have been cheated on by a boyfriend. She was actually finalizing her divorce. He gives her a bat and lets her destroy the room, assuring her that \"it's been paid for.\"", "episode_10": "We open with a girl and her father seeing House in the clinic for a supposed allergy problem. House figures out they are homeless and pretending to be related. But before the girls leaves he notices blood coming from her ear.House has the team meet him at a far-away diner (\"because I can\"). They discuss Jane Doe for a bit before Foreman walks in with his married girlfriend. House snaps a few photos and makes a few comments. Jane is clearly under 18, but House promised to not to calls protective services to keep her from running. The plan is to treat her for pneumococcus. Jane tells Adams she ran away from home because life was terrible, but has no interest in a group home or foster care. She also seems to be going to school. Two Civil War reenactors see House in the clinic for diarrhea. He is irritated by the fact they won't break character. Chase deleted the cell phone pictures House took of Foreman.

Iris got sick during her birthday party. Chase lied about having a dentist appointment and Park sees he got a manicure. The team wonders if Iris may have a drug issue.Iris tells Adams all she takes is Vitamin C. She had her reaction when opening a magic 8-ball. Her mother admits to Taub that she's been secretly giving her Diazepam.House tells Wilson about looking into the mysterious dead child. Wilson thinks he might be addicted to puzzle.The father of the dead child, Emory, is one of the people in House's anger management group.

Foreman thinks he has to nip House in the bud before he gets out of control.House and Taub have found Chase's TV appearance.House tricks Mickey into coming to the clinic. He tries to see if perhaps she has an emotional disorder that caused her not to react to Drew's death and could be related to what caused it. That doesn't turn out to be the case, but she mentions that her father used to watch Drew quite a bit. She warns House not to contact him.House gets an idea from his conversation with Mickey. He tells Iris that her boyfriend has been hurt. This seems to trigger her to say that she is the boyfriend. Iris has multiple personality disorder, which the docs think was probably the result of the car accident. She'll have no recollection of many of the things she's done the past few years. To help figure out her medical situation Chase wants to hypnotize her and talk to the rest of the alters.Wilson tells House Foreman won't back down. Despite this, House makes up a lie and goes to see Mickey's father, telling him he is a doctor, but that his name is Wilson. He tells House that he and the kid basically just watched a lot of TV. During the conversation Mickey and her husband, alerted to House's presence, show up. The husband punches House in the face.One of Iris' alters is a little girl. She can't feel her arms. She remembers vividly the accident that killed her father and thinks it was her fault because she was crying. Chase notices that Iris appears to be bleeding between her legs.When tests show that Iris is still pregnant they decide to ultrasound. They do not find an embryo and Hosue figures out that the reason the test was positive is elevated hCG levels. Iris has cancer.A conversation with Wilson gives House another idea. He goes to Mickey's house and is doing something with her second child in the front yard when she and her husband run out.

Since House has discovered this in time they will be able to save the child.When Foreman tells Wilson he's going to have House sent back to prison, Wilson says what Cuddy did so well was harness House's power as a diagnostician.Foreman sits next to House and asks him what Cuddy would have done. He says ten clinic hours, to which Foreman answers \"Cuddy's not here anymore: You've got 30.\""}, "season_6": {"episode_14": "We open with a woman up late writing on her blog. Her boyfriend Taylor comes out of the bedroom. He is upset that once again she is sharing their argument with strangers on her site. A neighbor knocks on the door to complains about the noise and sees that Frankie (Laura Prepon) has a black eye. Taylor is genuinely surprised to see the bruise, as is Frankie when she looks in the mirror and notices blood coming from her gums.Wilson comes home to find House putting away his porn movies. Wilson talks him into going for a night of 'speed dating.'The initial discussion of Frankie (and her blogging) with House results in Thirteen and Taub going to Frankie's apartment looking for toxins. While they're there the neighbor stops by again and lets them know Frankie has handled rat poison.Prior to the speed dating, House and Wilson tease Chase about his good looks. Chase doesn't seem to believe them. House bets Chase $100 he will still get a handful of names even if he pretends to be an unemployed jerk. House wins the bet and Chase seems stunned.Frankie has been writing about every aspect of her treatment in the hospital. She tells Foreman and Taub her urine is \"mud-colored.\" Foreman says \"we were wrong about the rat poison.\"The team offers several suggestions that work with this new symptom. During this, House yells at Wilson for returning his porno movies to the store earlier that day.Wilson comes into House's office. He is watching the one porn which Wilson chose not to return and report as lost. It turns out Wilson was in the film, having acted in a few PG-rated scenes while in college. Wilson's buddy began directing porn later and added x-rated footage with other actors (not Wilson) on top of stuff he already had.As Chase looks at Frankie's blog for clues, he asks Thirteen about his good looks and how shallow the women at the speed dating night were. He reads something about Frankie not being aroused sexually and suggests Sjogren's syndrome. This leads to Chase giving Frankie some tests. During those tests Frankie says she's not comfortable on her back.The complaint of Frankie's leads Chase to think she might have a heart valve issue. A cardiac test reveals he was right.Chase and Taub tell Frankie she can get a pig's valve or a synthetic one. The plastic valve would prevent her from having children, something which Taylor wants. Frankie wants to pose the options on her blog, which bothers Taylor.Wilson comes into his office to see Wilson has created movie posters for the porn and framed them on his wall. Virtually everyone in the hospital seems to have seen the film and knows Wilson's character's few lines.Wilson tells Chase he wants to dig up something on House. All Chase can come up with is that House has been reading a book inside another book's dust jacket. Clearly he doesn't want people to know what he is reading.Based in part on reader feedback Frankie wants to go with the plastic valve. Taylor thinks she's turned their lives into entertainment and he seems ready to give up on the relationship.Wilson and Chase look through House's office and find he was secretly reading a collection of sermons written by a Unitarian minister. As they ponder why House might be doing that, Wilson grabs the book and tells Chase not to mention it to anyone.Just prior to surgery Frankie begins complaining of sharp pain in her side and vomits.Foreman tells Frankie her appendix burst and they found numerous cancer-fighting cells throughout her body. All there is left to do is an experimental vaccine treatment. If not, she will die in a year.Chase asks a nurse he barely knows if he can borrow her car and she says yes. He tells Thirteen he has been fooling himself, that he's not ever really connected with anyone.Wilson asks House why he is reading the book of sermons. Wilson has done extensive research but can't figure it out. House acts strange and asks Wilson to leave it alone.The next day every member of the team is reading copies of the sermon book. Chase called the author and got him to send extra copies. House asks where Chase mentioned him during the call.During the third vaccine injection Frankie has a bad reaction. House isn't sure why she was sleeping during the day and finds on her blog that her day/night clock has changed in the past few months. House asks for a liver biopsy.The biopsy reveals that the cells in Frankie's appendix weren't actually the result of cancer. Unfortunately this means that unless they can figure out what's wrong with her liver she'll die in a few days.House is convinced there has to be something Frankie isn't telling them, which seems impossible given that her life is an open book. He orders broad-spectrum antibiotics and starts pouring over her blog.Wilson comes into House's office after seeing the actual dust jacket. He noticed that the author must be House's biological father. Wilson isn't sure why he's studying the book instead of contacting the man. Wilson mentioning House usually finds anything related to religion to be \"crap\" provokes a 'House moment'House asks Frankie about the one thing she hasn't discussed openly with her reader: her stool. Based on the way it changed in the past few months he recognizes that she has a curable disease. She'll need to be on meds for a few years but is essentially be okay. Frankie and Taylor's relationship seems like it might be okay as well.Thirteen tells Chase he's trying to devalue the relationship with Cameron. She thinks he's being paranoid.Wilson is convinced House was studying the book to find if there was someone else out there like him. House's response to whether he found anything was: \"Under the God stuff... more God stuff.\" They leave the hospital.Cuddy walks through the lobby and orders for someone from maintenance to \"take that down.\" That, of course, is a large poster for Wilson's movie House has erected over the lobby.", "episode_8": "A bearded delivery guy drops off boxes at a book store. The owner recognizes the man as James Sidas, a famous intellectual prodigy. When he convinces Sidas to sign one of his books, Sidas realizes his hands don't work.House and the team initially thinks Sidas has a rare blood disorder called Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP).Sidas tells Taub during an exam that he works as a courrier because it means he doesn't have to think. He fell in love with his wife Dara because she never cared how smart he was or what he had accomplished. \"I decided I would rather be happy than smart.\"Chase doesn't want to talk to Forman about Cameron leaving him.Taub tells Thirteen that Sidas seemed surprisingly normal for such a genius. Taub is convinced Sidas does not have TTP, and House is checking to see how long it takes the team to figure it out.House, who is looking all over the hospital for Wilson, doesn't blink when Taub and Thirteen suggest a splenectomy, the next course of treatment for someone with TTP.Wilson finally gets to work and is met by House, who tells him he's planning on breaking up Cuddy and Lucas at Thanksgiving. The couple is having dinner at Cuddy's sisters house and House wants to crash the gathering.Sidas begins rambling incoherently about colors which means that TTP is off the table, so the plan is to do an unstandard toxicology screen on Sidas and to search his home for other causes.At Sidas' place Taub asks Chase if he wants to come over for Thanksgiving. Chase is resistant to the sympathetic gesture. Behind a vent Chase finds a bottle of vodka.House helps out at Cuddy's clinic and it leads to her inviting him over for Thanksgiving. Wilson doesn't think House should go.The team moves forwards with Sidas being an alcoholic. Taub and Thirteen perform a liver biopsy. Sidas tells them he only has a drink here and there.We discover that Cuddy cleverly sent House to the wrong location for Thanksgiving.Sidas' tests come back clear. Taub and Thirteen consider kidney failure instead.Lucas returns home to find a drunken House waiting for him. House realizes that for the first time Cuddy has stopped giving him second chances. \"I'm pathetic,\" he says before falling over. \"I don't deserve her.\" Lucas invites him to stay on the couch. \"I love her,\" House says.The team (minus House) tries to figure out why Sidas' kidneys are failing. They put him on dialysis.Thirteen is next to make sure Chase is okay. Once again he says he just wants to be left alone.Cuddy shows up at House's place the next morning. Lucas has broken up with her, she says. He said he didn't want to get in the middle of what was between them. She's upset because House \"lived down\" to her expectations. \"There is no us,\" she asserts. \"There never will be.\"House next tells Wilson \"it worked,\" that Lucas fell for his trick.House believes Sidas has been taking cough syrup (DXM) in order to make himself stupid. Combining cough syrup with alcohol would cause brain damage and lower the IQ. Sidas tells his wife \"when my brain was on low everything didn't seem so miserable anymore.\" Sidas tells House he's not sure if he can live without the drug hmmmn, do we see a parallel coming into focus?The team has removed the traces of DXM from Sidas' system. He is now back to drawing highly advanced chemical processes. When Dara leaves the room, Sidas tells Foreman that when he is normal he is unable to want to be with Dara.House is back in the clinic. He bribes an undercover insurance company investigator to act happy with his care when she leaves the room, but Cuddy has already left for the day.Dara tells Foreman \"that isn't the man I married. He hates me.\" At that moment Sidas yells that he can't feel his legs.Taub and his wife argue over his going back to work with House. She's upset Taub is back to doing grunt work and is letting House push him around.An angry House is upset no one on the team is coming up with any good ideas. When he makes a crack about getting Cameron on the phone, Chase walks over and punches House in the face.While telling Cuddy that nobody punched him, House tries to ask her out on a date. She's not biting: \"I'm not doing this. It's not fun anymore.\"Sidas tells House that after a suicide attempt 12 years ago he was put on narcotics. \"Suddenly everything was just better. I didn't feel isolated or lonely.\" House suddenly has an epiphany that the ribs Sidas broke in his suicide attempt are significant.House realizes that Sidas has more than a dozen extra spleens, caused by damaging his spleen in the jump. Sidas has TTP, they just didn't remove all of his spleens.Chase apologizes to House. He says he hit him because he was sick of everybody asking him how he was doing.Sidas tells Taub and House he plans to return to the DXM.Taub takes a picture of House's face and tells his wife he was the one who punched him. She immediately starts to kiss him.House gives Cuddy petting zoo tickets for her and her kid. She refuses to take them.House tells Wilson Cuddy must have lied about breaking up with Lucas. He has no plans to mess with them anymore.Cuddy tells Lucas it appears House is going to leave them alone, but she's not sure why. \"Maybe House isn't so bad after all,\" Lucas says.", "episode_3": "Open with foreign head of state Dibala (James Earl Jones)) driving through the rain with an advisor. Two vans corner the vehicle and a man serves Dibala with a civil subpoena for genocide and crimes against humanity. As the adviser tells Dibala they can ignore the subpoena, Dibala begins vomiting blood.Foreman (Omar Epps) asks Chase (Jesse Spencer) and Cameron (Jennifer Morrison) if they will stay on and replace Thirteen (Olivia Wilde) and Taub (Peter Jacobson). Cameron is hesitant about treating a man like Dibala, given the potential harm he could do when he returns to his country. Since he is a guest of the U.S. government, Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) gives them no choice in the matter. Chase can't believe Foreman fired his girlfriend. The three find House (Hugh Laurie) waiting for them in the conference room. He is back, but is still a month shy of having a license. Unsurprisingly, House finds fault with Foreman's initial course of treatment for Dibala and steers them towards dioxin poisoning. Chase shoots the breeze with Dibala while Cameron stands and stews.House and Foreman meet with Cuddy. Her decision is initially House will be strictly a differentials consultant without patient contact. \"No procedures, no patients.\" House thinks he can handle the second part. With House on the path back to running the department, Foreman asks Thirteen if she wants her old job back. She thinks he's trying to break up with her and turns down his offer.A man from Dibala's country named Ruwe tries to convince Chase not to treat Dibala. He details some of the rape and torture - including his own wife - committed by Dibala's government. Ruwe says a massacre is on the horizon.House notices Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) is being particularly sensitive of a lousy neighbor living downstairs. The guy is a Vietnam vet//amputee who treats Wilson like crap, but Wilson is catering to him because he is on the condo board and Wilson wants a garden renovation.Thirteen finds out Foreman pulled a few strings to get her an interview. She agrees to go to dinner. House runs into Wilson's neighbor at the mailbox. The neighbor is particularly rude about House's cane noise.Dibala has a heart attack. House suggests Lassa Fever (LHF), perhaps contracted by a recent visit from foreign dignitaries. Dibala wants the doctors to use the blood from a woman who survived LHF to treat him. The woman is from Dibala's country and Cameron is sure she is being coerced. Ruwe dresses as an orderly and goes into Dibala's room with a gun. Chase screams out and prevents the assassination. Ruwe tells Chase he lied about having a wife who was attacked, in fact he was made to torture the woman by Dibala's soldiers. Cameron suggests next time Chase shouldn't yell out a warning. At the next differential, House uses sign language to convey his theory that Dibala is suffering from lymphoma. After thanking Chase for saving his life, Dibala explains he believes he is actually trying to prevent genocide. Dibala's son, a student in the U.S., no longer speaks to him. Dibala does admit to mistakes in his rule.Wilson's neighbor tells him he found House rude. Based on the neighbor's mail and a web search, House thinks he wasn't really a war hero. While trying to drop off an apology, House ends up sneaking into the neighbor's apartment. There he spots a Canadian flag. House confronts the neighbor about lying about his military involvement. His \"evidence\" is Canada did not send troops to Vietnam. The neighbor counters Canada did send troops to enforce peace accords and that is how he lost his arm, trying to save a boy from a land mine. The result? For 36 years he has suffered chronic serious pain.Cameron and Chase discuss the morality of letting a patient like Dibala die. The biopsy shows Dibala does not have lymphoma, but he does appear to be losing his mental faculties.At dinner Thirteen asks Foreman if he would still fire her if given the opportunity to re-do the decision. He says yes and she gets up and leaves.Cameron tells Dibala's chief adviser there is no way to know if Dibala is still capable of making logical decisions. House now thinks Dibala has scleroderma. Foreman goes with blastomycosis, and Chase and Cameron agree. Dibala confronts Cameron about her talks with his adviser. He thinks she is weak for not being willing to make a move herself.

House finally admits \"Okay, there may be a problem.\"Wilson purchased House's stuff back for him and says he was hasty asking him to move out. House gets in his car and leaves in a huff.House didn't think Wilson really meant the apology so it must have come from Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein). House guesses how the conversation between Wilson and Cuddy might have gone. House doesn't think either trusts him. Nolan suggests an alternative situation.

We then get the \"Eight Hours Earlier\" sign.House walks into Cuddy's office, where she is changing clothes. She tells him a crane collapsed in downtown Trenton. He gives her the book written by her grandfather with a house-warming note for both her and Lucas.House goes to the scene of the crane collapse and starts helping with patients. Foreman is also on scene and he helps secure the crane operator, who apologizes while on the gurney that he fell asleep for just a second. House examines the man, who had a sick child and was drinking coffee and taking caffeine pills to stay awake. House determines he could not have simply fallen asleep and tells Foreman he must have passed out due to a neurological disorder. House orders they admit the man, but Cuddy tells him he needs to stay on scene and help out.House calls Wilson and tells him he thinks Cuddy was acting weird when he gave her the gift, like she was hiding something. House hears a banging noise behind some rubble and has the firemen check it out. They find no evidence of a survivor and leave. House decides to crawl under the rubble himself and find a woman pinned.The woman, Hanna, has a leg pinned under a huge section of a beam.House leaves her and calls the gang back in the ER. Thirteen is missing for some reason. He orders them to give the crane operator, Jay, an MRI.An EMT tells House that Hanna is stable. Hosue crawls back under and gives Hanna an IV. The fire crew is having trouble getting the beam off her leg.At the scene House asks Cuddy whether something strange is going on between her and Lucas. She tells him they got engaged the night before.Following Jay's MRI (which is clean), he begins bleeding from his eyes and nose.Given the amount of rubble covering the beam on the surface, one of the firefighters thinks they should discuss amputating Hanna's leg. House disagrees and talks them into spending a few hours removing some of the debris before taking another shot at lifting the beam.House checks in at the hospital, where Thirteen has just showed up. House asks them to do an x-ray on Jay and get back to him. House tries to leave the scene but Cuddy convinces him to stay because Hanna needs him.House allows Hanna to call her husband Charlie. This spikes her blood pressure, so he makes her hang up. House and Hanna talk about his leg and seem to make a connection. He even agrees to pray with her.Taub asks Thirteen if everything is okay, since he was under the therapy she used as an excuse for lateness is normally on a different day.

House and the firefighter are okay, but one of Hanna's lungs collapses and House has to re-inflate it.House leaves to have a minor wound mended by Cuddy. House calls in and hears that Jay's tests have all been clear but he now spiking a fever. Given the amount of time Hanna has been under Cuddy thinks it is time to amputate her leg. House disagrees and these leads to an argument between the two. Cuddy thinks he is disagreeing with her because of her engagement and tells him to move on, emphasizing that she doesn't love him. She points out that everyone else has moved on and he is all by himself with nothing in his life.A somber House tells Hanna that Cuddy is right and she should have the leg amputated. He tells her he wishes he had amputated his own leg, that his mangled limb made him a worse person. She will better off if she does not end up like he did. She agrees.House performs the amputation himself. He cuts the skin, muscle and fat with a scalpel, then moves to an electric saw for the bones. Hanna is pulled from to the surface and sees her husband as she is put in the ambulance. House joins them in the emergency vehicle. On the way to the hospital House gets a call that Jay has fallen into a coma. House notices that every one of his major setback came in conjunction with a stressful moment. This means there was probably a clot in his spinal cord and he orders a CT.At this point Hanna's condition takes a turn for the worse. House tries several things before slumping backward with a terrible realization: \"It's not a clot,\" he says soberly. \"It's a fat embolism from the amputation.\" Hanna stares at House who simply stares back at her.The ambulance reaches the hospital with Hanna already dead. Foreman points out there is no way to prevent a fat embolism and there was no way to save her. This does not comfort House, who tells Foreman to get out of his way and leaves the hospital.We see Thirteen leave some papers on House's desk. Taub walks in and she tells him she is taking some time off. He asks if she is okay. \"Obviously not, \" is her reply.House walks in his door and head to the bathroom.

Once cleaned up, House wants to exercise his right as a voluntary commitment and leave Mayfield.

Nolan thinks he needs medication and therapy and refuses to write a letter reinstating House's medical license unless he stays the course of treatment.House is introduced to his new digs, Ward 6. In charge of the floor is Dr. Beasley (Megan Dodds) and House immediately threatens to make her life a living hell. House's roommate is Alvie (Lin-Manuel Miranda), a manic depressive Puerto Rican-American who enjoys freestyle rapping. We are introduced to the floor's primary characters: Silent Girl (Ana Lenchantin) hasn't spoken in a decade, Hal is a drug-seeker (Jack Plotnick), Jay (Alex D\u00e9sert) is the claustrophobic, Richter (Curtis Armstrong) is a paranoid, another man (Dale E. Turner) has an eating disorder and Susan (Angela Bettis) is suicidal. During the first group session House rips on every patient and is immediately sent to solitary confinement.House is even crueler to the other patients during time in the yard. He heads back up to the floor and finds a woman playing the usually locked piano. She is Silent Girl's sister-in-law Lydia (Franka Potente), there because the music seems to cause her to move slightly. House quickly dismisses the possibility of Silent Girl's head-bobbing being related to the music, asserting it's no more than an aspect of her pulse.After another stint in solitary, House changes his tactics. He decides to apologize to his fellow patients and turn everyone against the Mayfield doctors. His mini-uprising related to paddle-less ping pong table ends when Nolan arrives with new paddles. Nolan gets in House's face and promises he is just as stubborn as our ill-mannered protagonist.That night House comes up with a new plan.The next day a new patient joins them for group. It is Steve. a/k/a \"Freedom Master,\" (Derek Richardson) who believes he possesses superhuman strength and the ability to fly. Steve immediately turns his attention to Silent Girl, believing someone needs to save her. House looks out the window and sees Nolan get into a car with a woman.Since Alvie has third floor privileges, House has him break into Nolan's office and check his schedule for any information on the woman. Alvie finds no mention of a meeting on his calendar, which House takes to mean Nolan is having an affair.House and Alvie fake a fight in order for House to 'cheek' some drugs he can trade with Hal for phone privileges. That night he calls Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard). House wants Wilson to run the license plate number of the Noland's lunch date. Unfortunately for House, Nolan has already gotten to Wilson and warned him the best way to help House improve is not to help him skirt the system. A disgruntled House tells Alvie he plans to pretend to be getting better, but not take his medication.A musical montage shows House as a model patient, quickly shooting up the good behavior charts. He comes upon Lydia playing for Silent Girl. We learn Silent Girl has been a concert cellist. House suggests Lydia play the cello for Silent Girl and Lydia seems to like the idea.House meets with another member of Nolan's staff, Dr. Medina (Andrew Leeds). Medina is suspicious of House's progress, his lack of medication side effects and the fight he had with Alvie. This leads to House having Hal craftily provide him with fresh urine in order to fake a drug test showing House has been taking his meds. Medina seems to be fooled.House is bothered by Medina bluntly telling Steve he does not have super powers and it wasn't Steve's fault his wife was killed. Steve spots Silent Girl staring into an office and excitedly tells everyone \"they stole her voice box.\" Steve is hauled away to solitary.The next day suicidal Susan is getting a party for being discharged. House notices Steve is not at the party and finds him slumped quietly on his bed. House thinks Steve was happy before; Medina argues it was his being delusional.Nolan pulls House into his office. House thinks he can correct the rest of his problems on an outpatient basis, but Nolan still won't sign-off.

Unfortunately this leads to Steve trying to fly off the upper ledge of the parking garage and nearly killing himself.Nolan wonders why all of a sudden House would try and reinforce a sick person's delusions and threatens to transfer him to another facility. \"Don't,\" a suddenly aware House admits. \"I need help.\"In a one-on-one session with Nolan, House admits he wants to get better, he's tired of being miserable.

Lydia confesses Silent Girl was her best friend and she may have married her husband primarily because they were both sharing the loss. Before she leaves, Lydia kisses House.House and Nolan discuss his kiss with a married woman.

They hug, which evolves into tender (as opposed to the frantic, passionate event with Cuddy near the end of last season) sex in a nearby empty office. During coitus we see tears in House's eyes.The talent show is uneventful until Alvie's performance. Alvie struggles mightily with his rhymes and needs helps from House who is standing in the back. Eventually House gets on stage and finishes the rap responsively with Alvie.At the next session House tells Nolan \"things are actually good. . . I'm good.\"House apologizes to Steve and wheels him over to get meds. On the way, Steve raises the box towards Silent Girl. She takes it from him and opens the top. After the music plays she turns to Steve and says \"thank you.\"When Lydia arrives later Silent Girl is playing cello for the entire floor. Lydia weeps with joy.There is a send-off party for Silent Girl. Nolan tells House she is being sent to a rehab facility in Arizona and her family is moving with her. Against Nolan's advice, House demands an overnight pass to go to Lydia's house. Lydia tells House her husband does a lot of business in Arizona and the family had been looking for a reason to move. Lydia does not want to leave but can't break-up her family. \"I thought it ended kind of perfect,\" she tells him before closing the door.Nolan finds House waiting for him in parking lot.

Wibberly failed the course he took with House based on the paper House wrote.Thirteen ignores the group's decision and instead gives Valerie an MRI. During the test she learns that Valerie does not feel emotion: She is a psychopath.After House says he thinks Valerie's heart ailment is related to her mental issue, she admits to having given Russ some Valium so he would look drunk and get fired. She admits to the affair and says she's with Bill because he has a trust fund.Working on the possibility Valerie has tertiary syphilis they start her on penicillin. Foreman tells House he thinks they need to punish Thirteen. House wants no part of the situation.House tells Wilson he thinks Wibberly has an agenda. Wilson suggests it's possible Wibberly is a happier person without the stress of working in medicine.House visits Wibberly and learns that he is about to lose his home. Medical bills from his father's illness and an adjustable mortgage have caught up with him.When Bill leaves the room Valerie, tells Thirteen she will sue her if she lets her husband know about her affair with Russ. Thirteen takes one of Valerie's arms to check her IV and the bone breaks.Valerie asks Cuddy to remove Thirteen from her case, but House backs Thirteen up. Valerie's bones were brittle due to kidney failure. Syphilis has been ruled out. House tells Thirteen and Foreman to figure out their relationship.After Valerie is taken away for radiation, Thirteen tells Bill they could still check for environmental causes. He mentions a landscaping class she took (her cover for the affair) and Thirteen suggests he look into that.Bill finds out the landscaping class was a lie and confronts her. She covers with a lie about work and it appears to work.Valerie tells Cuddy to fire Thirteen. Cuddy agrees to remove Thirteen from contact with Valerie.Thirteen finds out someone has called the medical board charging her with sexual harassment. She charges into Valerie's room and begins yelling at her. Foreman tells her to leave the room and reminds her that the only way she'll get in trouble is if she takes the bait. During the conversation Foreman apologizes for firing her.Valerie begins bleeding from her face and is unconscious. Uncomfortable making a tough decision about whether to bypass her liver, Bill eventually just lets Foreman do whatever he thinks is best.Without a firm diagnosis, the team knows Valerie will never get a new liver. Bill isn't the right blood type and they doubt she has any family members who would want to help her.House is writing Wibberly a check to cover some of his mortgage. Wilson is again angry that House is doing so much to make amends to Wibberly but nothing for Cuddy.Valerie's sister Sarah visits her briefly. Thirteen stops to ask about their past. They had an abusive father and Valerie was protective of Sarah when they were young. This indicates the psychopathic behavior is a symptom.House thinks Valerie has Wilson's disease (hepatolenticular degeneration) and that her recent change to a natural diet introduced more copper into her system. It is confirmed when they find her fingernails are blue.Thirteen tells Bill that she might not ever fully recover and probably never loved him in the first place. He seems willing to live with the way their relationship had been even if there was no love on her end.House goes to Wibberly with the check. Wibberly admits that House's paper got him an A+ and he ended up being an orthopedic surgeon for a decade before gambling debts cost him his license. House still wants to give Wibberly the check but he will not take it.Valerie's condition is improving and Thirteen tells her they can now get her on a transplant list. When Bill discusses their future together, she tells him he's pathetic and hints that the idea of spending the rest of her life with him might have made her sick. He leaves and Thirteen realizes this interaction means Valerie is getting better. A psychopath would have continued stringing him along, but Valerie chases him away because she feels guilty.There seems to be a great deal less tension between Thirteen and Foreman, and there are signs they might be getting along better.House returns to Wibberly's house, indecisive before sticks the check into the front door mail slot, then turns and quietly leaves.", "episode_15": "A high school couple is sharing some vodka during a class trip to a planetarium. The girl (Cali Fredrichs)) stops breathing and begins frothing at the mouth.House (Hugh Laurie) makes fun of Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) for not having furnished for his condo. House thinks he's scared of making furniture choices because women have always made the decisions for him. House wants him to \"buy some furniture or admit you're empty inside.\"The fluid which almost killed Abby was the result of a pulmonary edema, meaning either her heart or lungs is the problem. Taub is not in the office and House thinks it's because he's fighting with his wife. The team guesses a history of alcohol abuse could the problem and they decide on an MRI.Taub (Peter Jacobson) and his wife are, in fact, arguing. The debate seems to be they don't do anything together and don't have much of a relationship.Taub arrives at the same time Abby's boyfriend (Nick Eversman) and his father Artie (Dennis Boutsikaris) get to the hospital. Nick says Abby doesn't drink much.During Abby's MRI Taub admits to Chase (Jesse Spencer) that he and his wife are fighting. They spot an abnormality of some sort on her heart.There are no signs of parasites or fungus and whatever it is didn't come through her intestines. House has figured out Taub was lying about a flat tire causing him to be late. There are no ideas how an infection could have gotten into her heart.While Thirteen (Olivia Wilde) and Taub look at her heart via a trans-esophageal echo, Abby begins to seize. They crack her open in the OR and Thirteen has to re-start the heart with her bare hands.There doesn't seem to be anything wrong with her valves and alcohol was not the problem. They wonder if perhaps an internal allergy is the issue.The team decides to test Nick's semen to see if Abby is allergic. During the test she starts having stomach pain and Chase notices there is blood in her urine.Abby's kidneys are now failing. With no other options the team goes with a full body scan.During Abby's scan Taub asks Foreman (Omar Epps) how he can prove to his wife he's not cheating on her. Foreman thinks Taub is being selfish in the marriage.House returns home to Wilson's and finds the entire place furnished.Abby starts to hallucinate during her scan. She senses an earthquake, then feels she's being pulled into a giant black hole.The team isn't sure how her brain has become impacted. During the meeting Taub texts his wife to tell her where he is and to ask what she is doing. House steals his phone and asks Taub's wife to take off her shirt and touch herself. House brings up the brain can sometimes give the body hints as to what is wrong with the body. He thinks Abby's subconscious is trying to tell her what is wrong and they \"need to eavesdrop.\" He thinks the Cognitive Pattern Recognition program could help them but Foreman wants to go with more testing first.Wilson comes home to find the house empty again. House has given all the furniture back, thinking Wilson cheated by renting it from a service. He thinks Wilson is avoiding making the decision and wants him to buy at least one piece of furniture on his own.When Abby wakes up, Nick is there. He talks to her and begins working towards a proposal of marriage. Meanwhile Abby begins to hallucinate again, this time seeing a younger version of herself. Young Abby says Abby should \"tell him the secret\" and \"your secret is killing you.\" Abby starts seizing again.House now pushes forward with the cognitive recognition, which he thinks is their only shot.Taub's wife arrives at the hospital.Foreman tells Abby and her family a computer will map her brain function for a few hours, then while she is under anesthetic, display images of her subconscious.Taub and his wife start fooling around is his car. She is worried the car-thing is something he's done before.Wilson doesn't have any luck at the furniture store.During Abby's cognitive recognition test, the team sees images of the black hole from earlier as well as of a man, presumably her deceased father. This seems to be a dead-end and the team wonders if their might be a tumor hiding in her pineal gland.Cuddy tells Wilson he should find a decorator.Tests reveal nothing in Abby's pineal gland, but there still seems to be indications of an allergy or parasite. Foreman suggest a Middle Eastern parasite, which House angrily discounts because Abby's never been to that part of the world and their scans haven't revealed any bugs. All her systems are failing and House doesn't know why.While talking to Taub about the fact his wife hasn't actually asked him if he's having an affair, House has an idea. He wonders whether Nick's father might be the one in her visions.House confirms with Nick's father he travels for work. He then gets the man to admit (with Nick standing there) he slept with Abby while she was broken up with his son. Abby got a parasite from Nick's father's semen and is going to be okay.Wilson had the condo decorated. House notices there is an organ in the room, the one item Wilson picked out himself. House is impressed and immediately sits and begins to play \"A Whiter Shade of Pale.\"Taub proposes to his wife and tells her he wants to be a better husband. In the hospital, Taub tells House his wife said yes: \"Good for you,\" House says. But House watches as Taub and a blonde nurse meet in the hall, link arms and walk off together ... perhaps he IS having an affair?", "episode_4": "Open at the mansion of Roy (Lee Tergesen), a super-wealthy captain of industry.

She asks whether he legitimately wants Foreman to run the team.Cameron pages House and he interacts with Roy in person for the first time. She has found red spots on Jack's chest and stomach. House tells Roy his son's mysterious illness is \"fascinating.\"The new rash makes Chase suggest polyarteritis nodosa. House takes notice when Foreman suggests Cameron perform the testicular biopsy instead of Chase. When Cameron tells House the rash was also on Jack's penis, he says the child must have Degos disease.House tells Roy that Jack has Degos and there is no treatment. He will die in a day or less. \"I'm sorry, I wish there was something we could do,\" House says.Chase goes to see Cuddy and very nearly confesses he intentionally caused Dibala's death. She is called away just before Chase can get it out.Roy has a team of lawyers with him in Jack's room.

He seems to confess, saying he wants her to remain on the team because she is good for House. \"Don't throw it all away because of a bad break-up,\" he tells her.Wilson tells House he confessed to Thirteen. House reveals he cancelled the trip to Thailand. During their conversation House has a revelation.House goes to Foreman and orders a new course of treatment. The child has to have primary antiphospholipid syndrome.Chase spots a folder on his desk. He goes to Foreman and asks \"where'd you find it?\" One of Dibala's previous doctors had been prescribing drugs for high cholesterol. The revelation gives them an easy explanation to use at the M & M, but Foreman admits he didn't find the new info.Jack is doing well. The newly broke Roy tells House \"it worked.\"House tells Chase he made an assumption based on Dibala's race and weight which led to finding the prescription. House doesn't think Chase should be fired: \"better murder than a misdiagnosis.\" Chase hands House his ball: \"Whether you want to be in charge or not, you are, and always will be.\"An ending montage shows us the M & M going well and Thirteen getting on a plane. Roy's home is in foreclosure and he couldn't be happier with his now-healthy son.", "episode_10": "Open with two criminal-types discussing drug business in an underground parking lot. The conversation gets heated and their two henchmen end up wrestling over a gun. One guy gets shot in the foot, but it's the other man who ends up face down on the pavement.House (Hugh Laurie) stitches up the criminal's (Mickey) head, telling him he was doing him a favor by keeping him out of the ER and its prying cops. Though House seems aware the injury is unique: no scrapes to indicate the guy tried to stop his fall, powder burns on his jacket, etc. Mickey (Ethan Embry) still gets up to leave. House then slams his cane loudly against the bed and Mickey passes out and drops to the floor once again.House presents the loud noise-induced vertigo to the staff, along with the fact Mickey and his buddy were probably drug dealers of some level.

Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) pops by and tells House the other residents in their building think they're gay. Eddie said Mickey hated dealing with cocaine.Cut to Mickey seizing in the chair during his hearing test.The doctors think drugs aren't related to Mickey's issues. Thirteen (Olivia Wilde) suggests they check his arteries.Foreman goes to Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) looking for a raise. She tells him he doesn't have a competing offer for leverage.House still thinks the condition is drug-related and has bugged Mickey's hospital room.They tell Mickey it will take weeks to figure out what is wrong with him and he requests a discharge.

During the procedure Chase points out to Taub that Mickey's heart rate is normal.Wilson confronts House about his new joke to pretend the guys are actually gay. House apparently now wants to make a move on Nora himself. Chase comes in and tells House about Mickey's heart rate remaining stable despite a needle being stuck into his spine.House tells Mickey he knows he's been taking beta blockers. Mickey admits he's been taking them to control stress. House thinks Mickey was going through beta blocker withdrawal and might be producing extra adrenaline.Eddie has been genuinely concerned and supportive throughout Mickey's ordeal, and it seems, while Mickey is married and straight, Eddie's care for his stricken associate has homosexual undertones.Wilson comes home to discover House rubbing Nora's shoulders in just the way he had told Wilson he would make his move. Wilson grabs a seat to spoil House's game.Foreman tells Taub he made-up another job offer and Cuddy called his bluff. He is now planning to leave the hospital after this case.Wilson tries to tell Nora they are straight and House is pretending to be gay. She doesn't buy it.The adrenaline idea is wrong and the gang is back to just vertigo and fever.After Thirteen also has trouble getting House's surveillance equipment to work, House realizes Mickey must have a bug in there himself. Mickey is actually a cop.Because of how big his case is, Mickey still refuses to give up any personal information about himself. They are a day away from a huge bust, the culmination of a 16-month operation. He asks them to keep him alive for 24 more hours at which point he will tell them anything they need to know to fix him.

She begs for her job based on seven years of good service, but Cuddy fires her anyway, promising she won't report her to the DEA.Cuddy is having trouble tracking down her babysitter and Lucas. Wilson suggests Cuddy ask House about the insurance companies.Lucas brings Cuddy lunch and she yells at him for talking to House about their sex life. He offers to dig up dirt on the insurance company's CEO, which gives her the idea to track the man down at lunch. She makes points about his hospital spending money on golf sponsorships, private jets, etc, but being cheap with her hospital. She threatens to make a public statement about their skewed financial priorities, but he doesn't flinch.The head of the pharmacy tells Cuddy that Gail has been stealing ephedrine for the past three years, to the tune of $50,000 worth of the drug. This means Gail was supplying a meth lab and calls for Gail to come back in.Eli shows up to say her meeting with the CEO earned her a new offer: eight percent. She turns it down.Cuddy asks House for his opinion on the insurance negotiations. He hints that a large company like AtlanticNet might not care about the negative press. \"Sometimes the bigger they are, the harder they kick your ass.\"When the 3:00 pm deadline passes, Cuddy tells senior staff that as of 5:00 pm the contract will be terminated.

He tells her she's not going get fired or leave the hospital: \"This place needs you, and that matters to you.\" House says he thinks Gail is a sociopath based on the way she opens her mail.

Gail responds by boldly claiming that she has been stealing the entire time she was there and Cuddy will never find out the true story. She exits.Cuddy hands her assistant one of Lucas' listening devices she hid in the office. Everything Gail said is on tape and it is going to the DEA.Cuddy finally hears that her daughter is feeling better.

The next day the ringleader, Jordan, regales her friends with a story of booze, video games and skinny dipping. As she tells the story her ankles and hands begin to swell grotesquely and she drops to the floor unconscious.Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) is going to a pharmacology conference. He is trying to get a reluctant House (Hugh Laurie) to come with him.House thinks Jordan has Rhabdomyolysis, but no one else in the department is sure. They decide to run a full battery of tests. House makes a comment in Cameron's direction about how annoying it is when everyone knows something and you don't. (Obviously a veiled reference to what has been troubling Chase....)Chase (Jesse Spencer) tells Foreman (Omar Epps) he is struggling with telling Cameron (Jennifer Morrison) about killing Dibala.House goes into Cuddy's (Lisa Edelstein) office to try and discharge the patient. He enjoys giving her breasts names (Patty and Selma {part of the Simpson's treasure hunt promo this week on Fox}) and teasing her.

After a few seconds Jordan cannot move her arms and House determines she lied about her evening.Jordan and her friend Phoebe fess up.

Since Jordan is a \"credit card kid,\" the two ended up staying in a room at the hotel.The doctors discuss food as an option.House discovers that Wilson is presenting a speech about end-stage treatment. Uncommonly, he hasn't mentioned this to House.For his part, House is all fired-up about making a move on Cuddy.Cameron asks Foreman whether Chase is having an affair.

House and Cuddy talk about fooling around one night back when they were in medical school. House apologizes for not calling her afterwards and Cuddy leaves in a huff.Wilson gets a call early in the morning that his patient died. House thinks its weird Wilson sounded guilty and grabs Wilson's laptop. Wilson is planning to give a speech about assisted suicide.Using hotel surveillance the docs learn Jordan took the comic book guy's journal up to his room.Wilson is adamant someone needs to talk about what doctors go through regarding end-stage decisions.

Cameron is sure the man \"roofied\" Jordan and took advantage of her.Cuddy tells Wilson that, as a mother, she needs a guy she can count on. House does not qualify.In an attempt to find out exactly what happened, Cameron suggests they give Jordan Amobarbital to get her to tell the truth.Wilson tells House he needs to be more reliable to make Cuddy happy.

While there he discovers (gasp!) that Lucas is in the room playing with the baby.Wilson wakes up and realizes House has taken his pants. House is downstairs giving Wilson's speech, the text of which admits to allowing a patient to take a fatal dose of morphine. The speech goes over well. Afterwards, House tells Wilson he wanted to help his friend get the story out without losing his job.During the conversation with Wilson, House realizes Jordan's problem was eating oysters that night. Jordan has hemochromatosis and the natural properties of the oysters started down a path of her getting more and more iron and damaging her liver.Cuddy's and Lucas' relationship began when she was investigating someone in accounting. They were worried about what the news might do to House.Jordan is finally out of the woods. Her parents look like they are ready to head out of town again. Jordan admits to Cameron she never even knocked on the comic book author's door.House seems cool with Lucas being in Cuddy's life. Wilson thanks House for making him feel better about what he did with his patient.As the episode ends, Chase finally tells Cameron he killed Dibala.", "episode_12": "Open at a pre-NFL scouting combine workout. We're focusing on an enormous and dominant offensive lineman named Daryl, while listening to his mother Glenda talk up her son to one of the pro scouts. After making yet another big play however, the young man seems to lose his cool. He rips off another players face mask, then begins slamming it into his own forehead over and over again.Wilson wakes up to strange humming. He shuffles to the bathroom where he finds House in the bathtub. Wilson tells House he's not allowed to use his bathtub or bathroom anymore saying \"He who signs the loan chooses the bedroom.\" House tells Wilson that he owes him $35 for the grab rail mounted on the wall.Daryl, all 6' 7\", 310 pounds of him has no memory of the incident. His psychiatric evaluation and steroid tests came back clean. House still thinks Daryl is on steroids. (Of course, after all, he has a problem with drugs so he assumes everybody abuses drugs.)

Foreman ignores this.Daryl and Glenda make it clear to Taub that Daryl needs to be out of the hospital in a week to play in a game for scouts.A soldier comes to see House complaining of seeing spots. House calls the kid on faking the symptoms to avoid returning to war. The kids' wife is pregnant and this will be his fourth deployment, one more than the number for which he had contracted, but House doesn't seem to care.When no pituitary issues are found they flush Daryl's system to get rid of the steroids. As Daryl is claiming he's never done steroids, his heart begins to race.Foreman's brother Marcus (Orlando Jones) arrives and House immediately gives him a job as his assistant. Foreman doesn't seem happy about this development and tells House they are going to test Daryl's heart.Foreman tells Marcus that House is only hiring him to annoy him. Marcus thinks Foreman should get over it.Wilson finds an unhappy opossum in the bathtub.Daryl's heart tests fine. House is getting Marcus to tell him secrets about Foreman. Foreman suggests one possible condition, but after Marcus references Hank Gathers they decide to consider hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Wilson comes in accusing House of putting the opossum in the bathtub as payback.Foreman asks Cuddy to step in with regard to Marcus. He mentions that his brother has been a repeat offender for years. She will not help.House claims to Wilson that he did not put the animal in the bathtub. Wilson suggests that maybe House hired Marcus because he has regrets about his own family relationships and is trying to be nice. Daryl's stress tests come back normal.Daryl wants to leave the hospital and house prepares to give him an injection to test the heart chemically. House notices Daryl's hands are turning white.Foreman wants to remove Daryl's spleen, but House suggests an Ephinal drip. If Daryl feels itchy they will know it's the spleen.Marcus is furious Foreman won't give him another chance.Wilson is still convinced House is purely being nice with his hire of Marcus. The soldier returns, having shot himself in the foot on purpose.Daryl ends up feeling itchy.While in the tub House goes to grab a handrail and it breaks off, causing him to slam his head against the tub. He accuses Wilson of payback, but Wilson pleads ignorance.During surgery they find that Daryl's liver is inflamed. The spleen isn't the problem.Taub suggests perhaps a re-used needle might have caused hepatitis.Marcus tells House that their mother recently died and Foreman did not speak at her funeral. Marcus is adamant that House not use that information against Foreman.The team next works under the assumption that Daryl has cryo-globular anemia where his blood gets thick when it's cold. They need to put him on blood thinners and he'll be fine in a few weeks. Daryl wants to play this weekend, but Foreman warns him that there is a good chance he could die on the field.House realizes that Wilson is not responsible for the handrail. He thinks someone else is out there messing with them. Late that night while lying in wait to catch their mysterious antagonist, their sprinkler system goes off seemingly spontaneously, ruining the flat-screen TV. This convinces Wilson that House isn't to blame.No one in the department appears to have been responsible for the tricks being played on House and Wilson. House then breaks his promise and brings up Foreman's and Marcus' mother, causing Marcus to quit on the spot.Daryl has gotten a team doctor to clear him to play. Against Foreman's advice Daryl says he's going to play, that he needs to get a big contract to help his mother. Glenda convinces Foreman to go with Daryl to the game.The solider returns because he shot his foot and is happy to learn he's going to lose his toe. He is unhappy when House tells him missing a toe doesn't mean he won't be able to serve. He suggests keeping him on the same antibiotic which would cause him to lose more than just a toe.As he about to leave the tunnel and take the field Daryl tells Foreman he can't see anything and asks to be taken back to the hospital.Foreman tells House he spiked Daryl's water bottle in order to scare him into returning to the hospital. House mentions that since Daryl checked in he lost only a single pound when he would have been expected to lose ten or more. They perform another round of testing.Foreman goes to Marcus' halfway house and invites Marcus to stay with him and get him another job.We discover that Lucas is responsible for the pranks being played on House and Wilson. He tells them that if they decide to retaliate he will tell Cuddy that they stole her dream condo out from under her.Daryl's kidneys are failing which should mean cancer, though they can't find it anywhere. House thinks it must be melanoma and finds evidence (a mole) on the inside of one of Daryl's toes.We see that Cuddy actually knows they stole her condo, but that she wouldn't allow him to retaliate.Wilson points out that House was the common enemy to help bring Foreman back Marcus together.The young soldier is being wheeled out of the hospital in the company of his pregnant wife and we see that his foot has been amputated."}, "season_7": {"episode_22": "Open with a sweaty woman hotwiring a car. It seems she's bleeding several from her stomach. She crashes into a mailbox and staggers into an apartment building. She knocks on a door and we see that it is Thirteen's (Olivia Wilde) place. \"Darrien?\" Thirteen asks, clearly knowing the woman. Darrien tells Thirteen she wants to be stitched up but refuses to go to the hospital. This is a prison acquaintance of Thirteen's. Both are worried about going back. Ultimately, Thirteen promises not to take Darrien to the hospital.House (Hugh Laurie) brags about his new leg strength to a prostitute. He attempts to prove it by lifting two huge amplifiers. But he gets a cramp in his leg and drops one on a glass table. House notices he's out of the experimental drug he's been taking.Thirteen examines Darrien's stab wound and thinks a cut to her liver has been clotted off. She thinks Darrien might be stable, but will check her blood pressure constantly to see if there is a bleed she's missed.Foreman (Omar Epps) comes home to find Taub (Peter Jacobson) having a serious talk with Ruby. After she leaves, Taub tells Foreman she's pregnant.Darrien says the drug house she was in got raided by the cops. The guy she was with stabbed her to create a distraction. Darrien says it's her fault she started using again. Thirteen finds no pulse in one arm, but completely normal pressure in the right arm. Thirteen calls Chase (Jesse Spencer) and asks him to bring over a portable ultrasound, saying it is for a plumbing emergency.House goes to see the scientist who has been conducting the muscle re-growth study on rats. To his horror, the guy tells him all the rats are dead, the result of massive tumors caused by the drugs. He says the first sign was cramping. A few days later, the rats were dead.Chase realizes Thirteen was full of it and helps with Darrien. Thirteen tells her about being in prison and calls Darrien \"my friend.\"House gives himself an MRI. It doesn't appear as if the results are good.Chase correctly guesses the reason why Thirteen went to prison. Darrien (who has Hepatitis C) \"saved\" Thirteen when they were inside. Darrien's arm is starting to go numb. They find a mass in her arm compressing the artery.Foreman and Taub go to a strip club. Taub says he doesn't want to keep the baby, but Foreman correctly guesses he's considering it.Chase and Thirteen drain the mass from Darrien's arm, but Chase is worried they don't know what it was or whether it will come back. They wonder if her body used up her clotting factors dealing with the stab wound, which could mean she's at risk for bleeding in her brain or hearth. Chase thinks Darrien needs to go to the hospital, but Thirteen keeps her promise.House is going to perform surgery on himself in his own bathtub.With Chase gone to pick up meds, Thirteen asks Darrien about why she's blaming herself for getting back on drugs. Darrien isn't talking.House struggles to remove the first of what looks like several tumors in his leg. But after the first he can't keep his hands from shaking and begins to make mistakes. He calls Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard), but his friend doesn't hear the phone while asleep.Taub gets a lapdance and asks the stripper the best way to tell a woman you don't want to have a baby with them. House calls him as well, but Taub assumes House is drunk or something and doesn't pick up. Taub notices a mole on the stripper's back and asks if she had it looked at. After he touches it for a second time, the stripper has Taub thrown out.Darrien sees a young man with a gun at the foot of her bed. She begs him to put the gun down and tells him to put it down. The kid cocks the gun, but a shot hits him in the forehead before he can fire. Thirteen runs to the room to find Darrien hallucinating. She says \"I'm sorry\" over and over again.A desperate House calls Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein). Cuddy wakes to find daughter Rachel lying in her bed watching a pirate cartoon. She answers House's call.Chase returns. Thirteen thinks they need more clotting factor. He is convinced they must take Darrien to the hospital and get her a CT scan. Thirteen sticks by the fact she made a promise. Chase tells her he's going to take her anyway. They have a brief scuffle in which Chase knocks her to the ground.Cuddy goes to House's place. She calls him a moron. He was worried about surgeon taking more of his leg muscle and asks her to remove the second tumor. She says \"absolutely not.\"Chase drives Darrien and Thirteen to the hospital. He promises he will fudge the paper work so the police don't know she's there.In the car on the way to the hospital, Cuddy tells House she thinks he was trying to make his life better. She thinks he's unhappy and unhappy people do reckless things.Darrien tells Thirteen and Chase she used to be a cop. In the line of duty, she was forced to kill a 19-year old when he went for his gun. That was the event starting her down the road to drugs. Darrien loses consciousness.Cuddy figures out it was House who got Rachel watching the pirate show.Foreman finds Taub in the back of the strip club waiting for the stripper to ask about the mole. Foreman thinks he's going to get himself beaten up by the bouncers and wonders if Taub thinks he needs to punish himself. Foreman leaves.During Darrien's scan, Chase says Thirteen is holding onto this promise she made to Darrien because of the promise she made to her brother to help him die. If she doesn't keep all promises, her defense mechanism crumbles. There is no bleed in Darrien's brain, but she starts to shiver on the table. She must have an infection.Cuddy and Rachel bring House to the hospital. Cuddy thinks House might be going into shock and goes to find a nurse. While she's gone, Chase and Thirteen call House. Unaware of his predicament, they ask about Darrien.Sitting in his car, Taub debates calling Ruby but changes his mind.House thinks they should figure out exactly when Darrien contracted Hep-C. Thirteen thinks based on medication she was taking in prison, she must have had it for more than a decade. Since Darrien started taking drugs after the shooting, House thinks they should look there.Taub also considers calling his ex-wife, but changes his mind when the stripper walks out the back of the club. He tells her he is actually a doctor. She freaks out, calling him a pervert and thinking he's there to hurt her. She pulls out a gun and has him kneel on the ground with his back to her. She cocks the gun but ends up fleeing the scene. Taub is understandably rattled.While Thirteen looks online for Darrien's shooting, she tells Chase he was right about everything. She sees the shooting happened in 2008. The only reason newer Hep-C would look like older Hep-C is if she had a parasite.House is about to go into surgery. Before being taken away, he asks Cuddy to be in the OR. He doesn't trust the doctors will only remove muscle tissue or his entire leg as a last resort, but he trusts her.Darrien wakes up. Thirteen tells her she's going to be fine. Darrien looks down and sees she's wearing handcuffs and notices a cop standing outside her room. Thirteen says she had no choice and thinks Darrien will thank her one day.While waiting for House to wake up, Rachel says she misses him. Cuddy thinks she should write him a letter.Taub goes to see Ruby. He says during the moment he thought he was about to die, all he thought about was a former patient who seemed okay with news of terminal cancer because he had raised good children and knew the world was a better place. Taub wants to have the baby with her.In the locker room, Thirteen tells Chase she's terrified she'll destroy her life trying to forget something justified. She doesn't think it's something he could possibly understand. He says with tears in his eyes: \"Let's grab a coffee.\" He is obviously thinking about Dibala.The team comes back together the next day. Nobody talks about what happened the night before. House isn't there.We cut to House waking up in recovery with Wilson at his side. Both of his legs are there.Wilson tells him he was very lucky. House tries to walk to the bathroom himself and staggers. Wilson tells House he can't continue living his life this way.", "episode_2": "Open with an athletic teenage girl tearing up a skateboard course. Afterwards, she grabs her wheelchair-bound brother and starts pushing him around. All of a sudden, she keels over and falls to the floor, unconscious.House (Hugh Laurie) and Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) arrive in the hospital parking lot together and discuss how they will handle their relationship. Cuddy wants to inform HR of their\nrelationship and doesn't want to go public until then.Of course, the second House gets with the team, he tells them he's now sleeping with Cuddy and Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) doesn't believe him. They discuss the 14-year old girl from the open, Della, who has a heart arrhythmia. Her tests are clean. They tell House about Thirteen's disappearance and he doesn't seem to care. They mention Della's older brother, Hugo, has severe congenital muscular dystrophy and likely won't live past 25. They suggest Long QT Syndrome and plan to scare her in an effort to test her heart.Foreman (Omar Epps) doesn't like the scare test, Taub (Peter Jacobson) does.House goes to see Wilson, who still thinks he is lying about Cuddy. Cuddy comes into the office and has to grab House's crotch for Wilson to believe.House and Cuddy meet with HR and convince him that she will still be able to effectively supervise House. House mentions the scare test and Cuddy thinks it's a bad idea. Shockingly, House quickly gives in and cancels the test.We find out Della's kidneys appear to be failing.Taub tells House he's worried that him agreeing with Cuddy about the scare test could indicate a problem. House thinks Taub is jealous of his happiness. The next suggestion is amyloidosis which means taking a small amount of marrow from Hugo.And elderly father and son come to see House. The father is 102 years old and is having some health problems. House thinks it must just be old age, but they convince him to run tests.Della tells Taub and her parents she won't take any marrow from Hugo, despite the fact the process is virtually risk-free. Taub tells House who thinks it's clear she is living Hugo's life for him and wishes people were more selfish.Wilson wonders to House whether it's smart for Cuddy to be supervising him. House assures him he can handle it.Della admits to Taub she has been doing things Hugo can't do for himself. All of a sudden blood begins pouring out of her mouth.House tells Cuddy that Della is bleeding to death from her lungs. Again they differ on the best course of action, with House favoring something more risky and fast-acting. Cuddy defers to House, but as soon as she leaves House tells Chase to go with what Cuddy originally suggested.House tells Wilson he's starting to think he won't be able to work under Cuddy. He thinks they should come up with a gameplan together.Taub is still convinced House is giving in to Cuddy too quickly. The next suggestion is Goodpasture's and House orders treatment.The elderly son pays House 40 bucks to pretend the tests prove his father needs to be in a home. His father can't live without him, he says, and he wants him to move out.While lying in bed with Cuddy, House gets a call. Della needs a lung transplant.Della's donor lung started failing almost immediately. House decides to treat for rejection first, though it's starting to look bleak. Taub doesn't think Cuddy will approve this course of action, so House tells him to make the request, telling her she's good at sitting on her ample bureaucratic behind.The elderly father pays House 100 bucks to tell his son he should be in a home. He thinks his son is the one who can't let go. An angry Cuddy walks in and tells him it's unlikely to be rejection. House agrees with her, saying that was his thought the entire time.Outside, Chase (Jesse Spencer) hints to Taub that he's dating someone. They get a page. Della is crashing. It means she is rejecting the lung.Wilson finds House in the cafeteria. He realizes working with Cuddy isn't working. Chase and Taub show up and say that Della's problem is neither rejection nor injection. Though she's tested positive for LAM it doesn't appear to be LAM.Hugo tells House that Della's never been sick. This gets House to immediately ask Della whether that is actually true. She admits for a year she's had aches and chest soreness. It first popped up in Denver. Outside the room, House tells Taub she must have a sickle cell trait and they could have better helped her if she'd been honest with them. Without a donor lung, she will die and Taub knows the committee will never approve another one.House tells Cuddy an option is for Hugo to donate marrow and half of a lung to his sister. The result would be Della would live but Hugo would die sooner. Cuddy thinks it's irresponsible to even give the parents such an option. House agrees and admits he's deferring to her because they are in a relationship. Cuddy says she needs to find someone else to supervise him.House initially lies about the elderly father being sick, then diagnoses him as having zinc poisoning from using too much denture cream. He will be fine if he gets dentures that fit and House gives each of them back their cash.Della's father comes to House's office and emotionally pleas for him to give him every possible option. House eventually tells him about the Hugo option and tells the father they must decide by morning. Cut to Della's parents arguing back and forth through the night.Della asks Taub why she saw her mother crying but he doesn't tell her the real reason. Later we see Della has removed her tubes and climbed down the stairs, seemingly to try and kill herself.Cuddy tells House nobody in the hospital will supervise him. She says it is okay for him to give the parents the Hugo option and he tells her he already did. She doesn't get angry.Della's parents tell House they won't take the lung from their son. This sets off House who thinks they're making the wrong decision, choosing a few years of their son's life over decades of their daughter's. This causes Cuddy and House to get into a heated debate, all of which Hugo happens\nto hear.Hugo goes to Della and convinces her that he doesn't want to live without her, convincing her to take his lung.Afterwards Cuddy and House agree their argument was the first honest debate they've had since returning to work. They seem to commit to trying to make it work.", "episode_6": "Open with a political ad painting an opponent out to be soft on immigration. We see Senator Hal Anderson discussing the ad with his top aide Joe Dugan. Anderson doesn't like ad but Joe wants to run it. Joe starts scratching his arm. We see some scary-looking marks forming.Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) tells House (Hugh Laurie) that she hired a wunderkind third-year medical student to join his team named Martha Masters.The team talks about Joe's case, which came to them after a special request from Anderson. Joe has a rash and liver damage. Masters joins the team at a table but is very quiet after answering a few questions which prove her to be insanely smart. House orders a search of Joe's house and snaps at Masters that she needs to start having an opinion if she wants to remain on the team.Foreman (Omar Epps), Taub (Peter Jacobson) and Masters visit Joe's house. She refuses to go inside when she realizes they are breaking in without Joe's permission. Taub doesn't sound excited about having a med student on the team. Foreman finds an empty jug of unpasteurized cider in the kitchen.Foreman suggests to House that E.coli could have been contracted from the cider if the apples came in contact with manure.Taub and Masters perform a test on the cider and argue over telling Joe about breaking in to his house.While treating Joe with antibiotic, Masters tells him about breaking in. He doesn't seem to care. During a debate over ethics, Joe slips into a paralysis.The paralysis is subsiding. Hosue challenges Masters' strangely strong sense of ethics while a few possible diagnoses are tossed around. One possibility is a tumor Chase (Jesse Spencer) thinks is possible because the ad from the opening has been leaked. News of the ad is supposed to be terrible Anderson's campaign and Chase thinks this is a sign of poor judgment, a symptom of this type of tumor. House thinks Masters' morality is screwed up.Cuddy tells House he can't fire Masters without a valid reason.Masters goes to see Cuddy and says she scared she'll get fired. She says she's not good at working with other people. Masters is starting to think choosing medicine was a stupid idea. Cuddy assures her all House cares about is the case.Chase and Foreman look at a CT and discuss Masters. Lying on the table, Joe assures them that they will not find a tumor since his judgment is fine. He did not leak the spot, but thinks whoever did has done something good for Anderson. Joe admits the ad is completely dishonest, but doesn't seem to care since it will be effective. They do not find a tumor.Taub (who has been accused of resenting Masters because she makes him feel old) challenges Foreman to a game of basketball that night.Anderson visits Joe in the hospital and admits he was the one who leaked the ad. Recent polls indicate the move seems to be working. Foreman and Taub come in and notice Joe's kidneys are now failing.Based on the blood in Joe's urine, they come up with another suggestion for Joe. The options are chemotherapy or steroids. House and Masters argue about whether or not to tell Joe about the steroids, which is the less dangerous option but one also less likely to be effective. She thinks they are morally obligated to give the patient every option.House is proved correct when Joe chooses steroids in the face of Masters telling him chemo is the better option. Joe doesn't want the side effects of chemo so close to the election.Foreman beats Taub in one-on-one, but Taub very much holds his own.Masters finds out House is giving Joe chemo despite the patients request. When she threatens to tell Joe, House fires her and even threatens to have her kicked out of med school if she decides to talk to Joe anyway.Foreman tells House he thinks firing Masters was a mistake. The chemo has not accomplished anything meaning they are back to square one in terms of a diagnosis. The plan is to check Joe's fish tank for toxins caused by his exotic fish.Cuddy tells House she thinks Masters is a budding star and wants her at the hospital. House shoots back she should find a place for her outside his team.While looking at the fish, Foreman, Taub and Chase end up getting arrested. They call House who isn't interested in bailing them out.With the team in jail, House asks Masters to help. They toss around ideas while watching a press conference where Anderson fires Joe for leaking the ad. House stares at Anderson on the screen and has an idea.House tells Joe that based on Anderson's sweating and a rash, he noticed he must have Hepatitis C. House thinks Joe must have it as well, suggesting it could have been spread by sharing a coke straw. Joe's liver is preventing his body from registering a positive for Hep C. House knows he has the disease but can't prove it.In jail, Taub admits to the other guys he was nasty to Masters because he interviewed her for a different med school and she doesn't remember the hour-long conversation.Masters tells House a study she read about indicated 15 percent of Hep C sufferers could be cured by being given Hep A. Of course, the other 85 percent die quickly.Cuddy tells House and Masters they can only give Joe Hep A if they prove he has Hep C.Taub suggests testing Joe enough times that they come up with a false positive.House tells Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) he feels guilty about lying to Cuddy.House draws blood from Anderson but places Joe's name on the vials.House shows Cuddy the test showing Joe has Hep C. She thanks him for coming to her honestly.House asks Masters to come back to the team. Her final test is to help get Joe to let them inject him with Hep A.Masters convinces Joe his only shot is to let them give him Hep A, going as far as to tell him since House is risking suspension, this must be the only way. Out in the hall, House indicates to Masters that she is part of the team.Joe responds to the treatment. Masters tells Taub she remembers him from the interview and apologizes.House fills out the paperwork to officially hire Masters.We see Joe watch Anderson's speech after he won re-election.A nurse mentions to Cuddy that she saw Anderson in the hospital at the exact same time Joe's positive test was wrong. She asks Cuddy is everything is okay: \"I don't think so,\" is Cuddy's response.", "episode_5": "Open with a 40-something woman in labor. Her adult daughter (who arrived somewhat late) is filming. Once the baby is delivered the doctors announce it is hypoxic and call for a NICU team.House (Hugh Laurie) tells the team their latest case is a newborn with a mysterious breathing problem.Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) takes House aside and asks for babysitting help with Rachel that night. He reluctantly agrees.House suggests looking at the newborn baby's liver.The team splits and House tells Foreman (Omar Epps) to hire a woman.That night Rachel gets out of bed and tells House she wants some juice. He says no and sends her back to her room. House calls Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) and asks if he's up for a \"boys night in.\"New mother Abbey (who we find out got pregnant via sperm donor) and older daughter Justine (Gabrielle Christian) watch as the team checks the baby and finds dilated bile ducts.The team calls House via speaker phone. He is speaking smoothly to try and get Rachel back to sleep. Foreman introduces him to the new female doctor he's hired. House promptly fires her just to take Forman down a peg. House assigns Taub (Peter Jacobson) to hire a new doc. House suggests the team perform surgery on the newborn and hangs up.Wilson arrives with Chinese food. House immediately tries to leave and pawn the babysitting off on Wilson which leads to a game of leave-the-kid-by-herself chicken in the driveway. After a few moments, they return to find Rachel has gone through the food and has a quarter in her mouth. Before surgery on the newborn, another doctor (Cheng) suggests another option and they stop when her BP spikes.Outside of the OR, Chase (Jesse Spencer) suggests a non-surgery option. Taub asks the guys what they think of hiring Cheng. Taub is scared to hire (Keiko Agena) on his own for fear of getting the same treatment Foreman got and wonders if there is a way to trick House into hiring her himself.The quarter comes out, but a look at the bill leads House and Wilson believe Rachel may have swallowed a dime. With Cuddy coming home in the background, they discuss the possibility the coin could get stuck in her intestines and cause a dangerous blockage. She must be monitored for 24 hours. Wilson sneaks out the window while telling House he needs to tell Cuddy about the dime. Cuddy comes in the room and House says nothing.The newborn takes a turn for the better and Abbey (Jennifer Grey) is able to hold her for the first time. Justine walks in and we see there is tension in the relationship.Taub mentions House's team to Cheng, who is a pediatric specialist. She seems interested. He says there may be a way for her to be hired without an interview.That night, House jumps up to check on Rachel when she makes a noise. He opens up her diaper and is picking through it with chopsticks when Cuddy pops her head in.The next morning, House gets a call from his team. He hadn't heard about Cheng spotting the vascular malformation in the baby's in the OR. House thinks there is no way a malformation is causing the baby's problem and assures them there will be more problems.While Abbey holds the baby, she and Justine discuss her belief Abbey is being a better mother for this new baby than she ever was for Justine. The baby begins to bleed.House and Wilson sneak a sleeping Rachel into the hospital to give her an ultrasound. Taub calls to tell House the baby is bleeding as Wilson finds what he thinks is a dime. House thinks it could be a pocket of air. The only way to know for sure is an X-ray. The plan is to give Rachel some laxitives. Taub knocks on the door, House pops his head out and orders they give the baby a direct blood transfusion from Abbey.Almost instantly, the baby is better. House has no idea why.With Cheng participating in the conversation, they determine Abbey's blood could be a unique benefit to the kid. They will try and see if Taub's blood has any affect.House takes Cheng aside and offers her a \"test,\" basically describing what has been happening with Rachel. He directs her back to Taub.House tells Wilson they have six hours left before Rachel needs to be scoped. Since that is roughly when Cuddy gets off work, House grabs Wilson's radiation badge and compromises it, creating the impression the hospital has a leak.Taub's blood does nothing. They will need to take more samples.As House planned, Cuddy now has to work late. She asks him to babysit again and he agrees.During a test on the baby, Taub and Foreman find she doesn't have an infection. The newborn actually has skin cancer, contracted from Abbey.A mole was found under one of Abbey's index finger nails and a biopsy revealed melanoma. During a team meeting, House wonders how Abbey could have late-stage cancer and still be so healthy. Something in Abbey's blood is fighting something else which happens to be treating the cancer.Abbey has blood drawn. She tells Taub she was so careful throughout the process. After he leaves Justine apologizes for criticizing her mother parenting earlier.While testing Abbey's blood, Cheng tells Taub about her conversation with House. Taub thinks he told her the hire was his decision to \"set me up\" and Cheng is confused. Taub says he needs to find out what House is up to.Wilson calls House. After three poops, Rachel still has not passed the dime. He grabs some equipment and leaves the hospital.Taub asks Foreman about the Cheng situation while they examine Abbey on a scan. They find Abbey has lung cancer: \"Cancer treating cancer?\" Foreman says.Taub and Foreman tell Abbey she has lung as well as skin cancer. The lung disease is treating the skin disease which is why her blood is helping the baby. The cancer should be treatable, but they need to go after her tumor soon. They tell her the baby will get chemotherapy, which poses a small risk to its development. They could elect to hold off on her treatment for the eight or nine days it would take to help the baby, but that could be risky. Abbey says she wants to wait on treating herself and Justine is upset at the choice. This causes a debate, but Abbey stays with her decision to hold off on surgery.Wilson and House get Chinese food again and realize their last order was slightly different than they thought. Rachel couldn't have swallowed a dime because there wasn't an extra dime to swallow.Justine finds her mother unconscious in the nursery and yells for help. It turns out she had a massive pulmonary embolism which killed her in seconds.Taub tells Cheng it probably wouldn't have happened if they treated her right away. They were able to harvest enough of her blood to treat the baby. Taub then formally offers Cheng the job. She tells him she doesn't want to work on the team because of him, because he chose to act like \"a paranoid scared little kid\" when House gave him the option to hire her.We see it appears Justine is already taking a parental role with the baby.Cuddy gets up from bed to check on Rachel while House listens on the monitor. She finds a dime in Rachel's diaper and asks how she could have eaten a dime: \"House,\" comes the answer.", "episode_9": "Open at the subway with Jack (Matthew Lillard) and his young daughter Daisy talking. With a train approaching the crowd spots a woman twitching on the tracks and the father jumps down to help. He is unable to do anything but cover her as the train passes over them both. After the train is moved they seem both to be fine, though Jack immediately falls to the ground after standing up.Masters (Amber Tamblyn) presents Jack (the subway hero) to the group. House thinks the unnatural act of jumping onto the tracks means they should look for something neurological.Jack tells Masters he doesn't have any real memory of the day until he was put in the ambulance. His wife Eva (Sprague Grayden) shows up. Their daughter is still traumatized and Eva seems upset Jack risked his life at all.On an upcoming night House (Hugh Laurie) has both promised to attend a film festival with Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) and attend a birthday with Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) and her mother. Separately he asks both to help him let the other one down, essentially getting both to tell him he doesn't have to come to their event.While driving home, Taub (Peter Jacobson) spots himself on a large billboard. At home, Rachel (Jennifer Crystal Foley) tells him that despite the online friend she wants things to work between them and they start to fool around.Jack has a heart attack while Masters attempts to perform a test on him while under general anesthesia.House has the next team meeting at a bus stop featuring an enormous picture of Taub. Apparently, the hospital found his face to be trustworthy. The cuttent thinking on Jack is an issue with his autonomic nervous system. Despite this second cardiac reaction to stress, House still thinks the problem is neurological. He wants to biopsy Jack's pituitary gland but they talk him to a less-invasive sampling test.Because of the billboards, Eva asks Chase (Jesse Spencer) if she can consult with Taub.Cuddy and Wilson figure out House's game and bust him. He wants to drink scotch by himself, but they make him choose one of them. He picks Wilson, which backfires because he's now coming to Cuddy's birthday dinner.Eva tells Taub that for 16 years Jack has been traveling around the country with his band, making things hard on her and their daughter Daisy. She getting fed-up, but Taub tells her if his neurological tests are normal, he may be a remarkable man.Chase is upset Taub was chosen to represent the hospital over him. Foreman (Omar Epps) thinks he wasn't picked because he's black and is matter-of-fact about it.Jack's initial test is normal, leading to the pituitary biopsy House wanted initially. His stats drop once again, this time leading to fluid in the lungs.The team is down to heart and lungs. House suggests perhaps the epileptic woman might not be a stranger at all.Chase and Taub break into the woman's apartment. Taub is having a lot of sex with his wife and he's worried it's because she's so happy about her internet friend. The find one of Jack's band's CDs in the apartment.House tells a patient Arlene (Candice Bergen) that she is healthy. Arlene isn't sure and doesn't seem to like doctors. This leads to the revelation Arlene is Cuddy's mother.When Chase and Taub tell Jack about the roach bombs they found in the epileptic woman's (Chloe) apartment, he has no idea who she is. Masters brings Chloe into the room and it turns out the CD was a gift from a nurse -- they actually don't know each other. When Masters tries to help Jack bring up some sputum by hitting his back, he grabs his ears in agony.Masters thinks Jack has an infection that has spread to his mastoid. House doesn't buy it and suggests acoustic neuroma.House thinks since Arlene is crazy and hates him, he shouldn't go to the dinner. Cuddy demands he give her the two hours.After even more sex (this time at the office), Rachel references the online guy once again. He asks if she's in love with him and she says \"I've never met him.\"The initial test seems to prove House wrong.Jack tells Eva he's going to quit the band. She is ecstatic. Masters walks in to take fluid from his ear and lung. When she gives him Lidocaine his ear pain immediately disappears.Arlene is pretty brutal, managing to offend her daughter and Wilson with every sentence. House gets a call about the ear pain disappearing. House thinks the stick cut off signals to the pain center. The thyroid and liver are mentioned and Masters continues to push her infection theory. Arlene talks about marriage, finally pushing House over the edge. In mid-sentence she passes out, having been sedated by House. Wilson is next to drop onto the table, House's \"gift to myself.\"Masters asks why Taub is still with his wife. She asks if he's going to cheat again and he says \"I don't know.\" Foreman's liver test on Jack seems to indicate auto-immune hepatitis.Jack teaches guitar to Daisy. He falls to the hospital bed and begins seizing violently.We find out Jack seized three times before it was gotten under control and he developed a fever. It seems Masters was right the entire time, Jack has an infection. Still unsure what kind of infection Jack has, House picks a course of treatment.House sits in Jack's room (avoiding Arlene) and talks to him. Jack guilts him into returning to his office.Arlene actually apologizes to House. She thinks she got too drunk and thanks him for holding his tongue. She thinks this means he loves her daughter and is happy she has him. She references Cuddy's daughter making her sick and House has an idea.He goes to Jack's room and starts asking Eva questions about Daisy. He finds out she was a chicken pox carrier and changes Jack's treatment accordingly.A recovered Jack tells Eva the new press has helped the band and he wants to go back to them for a few more weeks. Taub watches this and afterwards Eva says this is what he's always done. She says there's \"nothing worse than loving someone who is never going to stop disappointing you.\"Taub comes home and tells his wife he thinks they should get a divorce. She admits even though she loves him she isn't happy. \"Then what are doing?\" he asks.Cuddy seems very happy with House.Taub throws paint at his billboard.House gets his night alone on the couch with booze and bad reality TV.", "episode_1": "Open where we left off last season, with House (Hugh Laurie) and Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) in his bathroom. Cuddy ends up fixing his cut and then kisses his bum leg. Off comes her shirt and they start fooling around.Post-sex House asks \"what's next?\" but is only referring to the next few hours of their day. Her phone rings with a call from Alex (Chris Conner), her new assistant. House grabs the phone. Alex tells him the neurosurgeon Richardson (George Wyner) just threw up in the ER. House tells him to fix the problem and hangs up.At the hospital the gang discusses House losing the patient and looks for a new case. It comes up that Thirteen (Olivia Wilde) is going to take a leave of absence.House and Cuddy clean up the broken glass in his bathroom. Her phone rings again but House talks her out of answering and suggest they spend the morning sans phones. Cuddy agrees, and points out Richardson has basically been a prisoner at the hospital for the past week since he is the lone neurosurgeon. If they are ever without one on staff, they cease to be a Level 1 trauma center and have to shut down the ER and ICU.House tells Cuddy he's going to make her a special bath and ducks away to call Chase (Jesse Spencer). He tells Chase to pretend he is a neurosurgeon to solve the problem.Foreman (Omar Epps) tells Thirteen he found ticket information indicating she is leaving for Rome the following day. He knows there is a medical center there conducting some research on her disease. Foreman thinks it is a mistake given her condition.House and Cuddy take a bath together and talk about whether they are starting an actual relationship.Chase tries to tell Alex that he is a neurosurgeon. But based on Cuddy's warning, Alex knows not to believe him.House makes Cuddy breakfast. They talk about what they know of each other before House ducks away to the bathroom again when he gets a call. Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) tells him about the snafu with Alex. House tells him to fix the problem.The team cannot find another neurosurgeon. The plan is to try and treat Richardson. Thirteen and Chase leave.House and Cuddy continue to enjoy each other's company when Wilson starts pounding on the door. He is worried about House. Cuddy wants to let him in but House wants to ignore his friend. The ringer on his cell phone gives him up and House tells Wilson he's actually okay and not suicidal. Wilson finally says he's going to return if House doesn't show up for work the next day.Richardson says he thinks he ate bad sushi, but food poisoning only partly explains his nausea. With the hospital being their first priority, Thirteen and Chase ask Richardson if he'll take a \"fairly risky drug\" if it will clear up his symptoms.After another round of sex, Cuddy wonders whether House was hiding her from Wilson.While waiting for Richardson to take his drug in the bathroom, Chase asks Thirteen if she wants to have sex. He had been planning to work on her for an extended period, but now wants to be blunt. She says nothing. Richardson comes out of the bathroom feeling much better but is now acting as if he's stoned.Wilson tries to sneak into House's apartment and gets stuck in the kitchen window. House finally lets him in and tells him he's there with Cuddy. Wilson thinks House must have relapsed and is now hallucinating. House brings him into the bedroom, but Cuddy is nowhere to be found. Wilson accepts House isn't suicidal and leaves. Cuddy had been hiding in the closet.At the hospital, Alex is quickly aware Richardson is in no position to treat patients. The team lies and says he has a blood sugar problem. A Department of Public Health inspector will be arriving in 15 minutes. Alex leaves. Taub (Peter Jacobson) tells Thirteen he thinks her leaving is a good idea.Cuddy says she hid because she forced House to go public and doesn't want to put any pressure on him.The DPH guy shows up and the plan is to pretend Richardson is in surgery. Unfortunately he comes out of the OR and begins removing his clothes. The DPH guy tells them they must start the process of shutting down their ER and ICU.Cuddy points out that earlier she told House she loved him and he did not say it back. He says words mean nothing before spelling out \"I love you\" with Scrabble letters.Richardson is still acting high and they asks where he's been. He tells them he visited a seafood festival which means a million things could have made him sick. Thirteen thinks he might have eaten toad eggs, which would explain his symptoms.Lying naked in bed, Cuddy and House toss around the idea of traveling to Europe together. She agrees, provided they go in a few weeks so she can arrange childcare.The give Richardson the antidote. Foreman apologizes for prying into her plans and tells her she shouldn't be alone. He offers to go with her for a few days, but she declines. The hold hands and seems to have become friends.Cuddy prepares to leave and House says \"this isn't going to work.\" House thinks he'll go right back to his old ways and believes he's the worst kind of boyfriend for someone with a child.Richardson seems fine. He answers a few questions from the DPH guy and the hospital is good to go. Chase again brings up his sex offer. This time she says no, but they hug.Cuddy tells House his being afraid means he's happy. She assures him she likes him the way he is and couldn't be happier at the prospect of them being together. \"I love you,\" is House's response.Foreman tells Chase and Taub he's found out Thirteen isn't signed up for the trial at the hospital in Rome. She's now disconnected her phone.Cuddy tells House \"it's gonna be great\" before leaving his apartment. They both smile at each other, but when the door closes, each has a look of concern.", "episode_3": "After having a conversation with an imaginary boy, a writer attempts to shoot\nherself after finishing a book. She begins shaking and only grazes her cheek.House (Hugh Laurie) tells Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) he's worried about what will happen between him and Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) once the honeymoon stage ends. He doesn't think they have much in common and\nwants to find something.House checks in on the writer, Alice Tanner (Amy Irving), of whom he is a big fan. Her maid sent her in for a seizure but House guesses correctly she tried to shoot\nherself. When she tries to leave, House places her on a 72-hour psychiatric\nhold to legally prevent her from discharging herself.House forces Taub (Peter Jacobson) and Foreman (Omar Epps) to do a full workup on Tanner, seemingly because he's a fan and wants her to live long enough to finish her series.Under the pretense it is a friend's place, House takes Cuddy to Tanner's\nmansion using stolen keys.Tanner is evasive with Taub and Foreman (asking for a female doctor), who are\ngoing to watch her to see if she has another seizure.Tanner's maid tells House she thinks her boss is depressed and is having\nissues with her back and hands. House steals the ribbon from Tanner's\ntypewriter (looking for information on her latest manuscript) and learns she eats 2-3\ncans of tuna fish per day.House shows up at the hospital and shows Taub and Foreman that Tanner \"wet\nthe bed\" but he isn't sure how.Tanner is initially diagnosed as having unilateral hyperhydrosis.House talks to Cuddy about Tanner wanting a woman doctor. She directs him to\nhire a female doctor to replace Remy Hadley/Thirteen within a week.Tanner quickly figures out House and Cuddy are together when she visits\nher. She also realizes based on perfume smell her maid talked to House.\nShe changes her mind about needing a female doctor.While House inspects Tanner's ribbon looking for sentences, Wilson tells him\nCuddy and he are both trying to find things in common, a good sign.Tanner has another conversation with her young male friend. Taub and Chase (Jesse Spencer) see her talking to herself, but she tells them it is not a hallucination. Tanner has an uncanny ability to figure people out based on minute clues. While correctly guessing Taub is a cheater, she starts talking about an ex-husband and grabs her head in pain and spikes her blood pressure.House thinks the excess of adrenaline is what is causing Tanner's symptoms and orders an MRI.Before being put in the MRI scanner Tanner begins screaming as something in her shin sparks and comes burning through her leg.Tanner had three screws in her leg she didn't tell anybody about. House\nreminds the team that the woman wants to die and they need to be more careful. With\n39 hours left in the psych hold, they must find something she wants.House offers Tanner a syringe which will kill her in exchange for letting them figure out the location of her adrenaline-secreting tumor. He recognizes her pain and thinks when she is better she'll want to live. Tanner takes the deal but instead immediately jabs the needle into her leg.House was lying about the syringe and Tanner is perfectly fine the next morning. She clearly has no interest in helping them keep her alive. Because she injected herself, House is able to add an additional 24 hours to the psych hold. She tells House the boy detective hero of her books dies and he looks miserable.After he tells the team to look for the tumor using ultrasound, House thinks he can find out about Tanner via the detective's older female mentor character in her books.House brings in Sam (Cynthia Watros) (who turns out to be a huge Tanner fan as well) to help him make sense of the typewriter ribbon using the MRI. She is able to figure out a way to tweak the software and print out the book.Cuddy tells House to pick \"something we both like\" for their date that night.On ultrasound, the team finds something which isn't a tumor encased around Tanner's heart.Tanner has a pericardial effusion, meaning she could have a virus or a cancer. House has read the manuscript and tells the team it ends with a cliffhanger. The mentor character has contracted a mysterious condition consisting of pain, fatigue and depression and dies halfway through the book. The best guess now\nis Lupus.House takes Cuddy to a go carts track after calling her mother. In fact, she liked them when she was 12. Cuddy ends up hurting her neck when Sam wrecks her. Cuddy is grouchy because of the pain and this gives House an idea.House realizes that the car accident which broke her leg also she damaged her thyroid. What Tanner has is hypothyroidism, which is curable. House thinks she should finish her story and give her detective hero, Jack, what he deserves. She yells at House that he doesn't know anything about him and promptly suffers complete paralysis.The paralysis contradicts House's thyroid diagnosis and Taub suggests a post traumatic condition which could be fixed if they find her records.Tanner refuses any more treatment, including the surgery she needs to live.Cuddy tells House she can't find a legal way to force Tanner to get treatment. House guesses Tanner wants to punish herself for something which happened before she was famous and thinks the answer must be in her records. Cuddy wonders if Alice Tanner could be a penname.House finds out Tanner (whose real name is Helen) was in a car accident with her son and is writing the books to keep him alive. She thinks she killed her son by letting him drive with only a learner's permit. Tanner feels she deserves what is happening to her. House reviewed her son's autopsy results and found out her son had a brain aneurism which both killed him and caused the crash. There was nothing she could have done. She and the vision of the son agree the accident was neither of their faults.Tanner gets her surgery. In the observation deck, we realize that House made up the story about the aneurism. Tanner's son simply wasn't very coordinated. Cuddy tells House having stuff in common isn't a big deal and she's never been happier.Post-surgery, Tanner tells House she wants to move on to writing adult books and won't resolve the story of her detective. House is upset but doesn't admit to his lie.", "episode_16": "Open with a rodeo bullrider named Layne pulling off a successful ride. Afterwards he stands strangely still while the bull knocks him across the ring and begins stomped on his chest and head.Wilson goes to look in on the recently dumped House, whose checked himself into a nice hotel. House has been going heavy on the Vocodin and says his pain is worse. Concierge Carnell references getting House \"anything\" he wants and House's mind quickly turns to prostitutes.House has also called in sick, leaving the rest of the team to figure out Layne. Making things difficult is that his lengthy injury history will make some scanning tests impossible due to the number of metal rods and plates in his body, and others useless. Masters learns for the first time about House's history with Vicodine.Wilson goes to Cuddy and begs her to give House another chance. While she agrees he deserves another chance, the situation isn't just about him. She doesn't think he'll ever be able to give her what she needs in a life partner. Wilson tells her he's back on Vicodin, advising her to keep an eye on his new patient.While in a bathtub with a prostitute, House advises the team the standard inner-ear test they used on Layne won't be enough since he's such an elite athlete. House is also well aware that Cuddy was in the room listening to the conference call.Layne passes the inner ear test with no problem. It is also clear that Masters has something of a crush on Layne, and muses that he would be a good choice to father a child with her.After the test Layne begins bleeding in his mouth.In bed with a different prostitute, House gets a call from the team. They tell him about the blood in Layne's sputum. Masters makes a comment to House his being on Vicodin. He lies and tells her he's not taking the drug as he takes the drug.Taub asks Masters about her attraction to Layne. Even she's not sure where it's coming from. Taub tells her not to worry about House and Vicodin. During the scope they notice Layne's eyes are yellowing.House (who is with yet another prostitute) suggests they need to cut Layne open to get a better sense of what is going on.During surgery they notice that a mass from Layne's x-ray has disappeared.They bring the new x-ray to House, who is lying in bed with another prostitute. House suggests an infection. Despite the danger House thinks they should try a ventricular puncture (needle into the brain), which might be slightly safer than a spinal tap.While performing the test on Layne's brain the patient's stats begin dropping. His airway is closed and they have to go the tracheotomy route to get his numbers back up. They notice a strong odor and discover it's coming from his feet.The team calls House with an update. While House and yet another prostitute trick Carnell with a fake William Tell-gone-wrong gag, he suggests another kind of infection and they plan to look at Layne's heart. Wilson shows up looking serious.To offset the obvious issue with the metal in Layne's body cavity, the team injects ice water into his body and attempts an MRI.At the hotel bar Wilson wants House to talk about his problems. House resists.With smoke literally coming from Layne's ribcage Taub is able to get an MRI picture. But it doesn't show anything abnormal.Wilson goes to see Cuddy and tells her she has to go talk to House. He says House needs her in his life even if the relationship isn't romantic. But she responds that \"I can't fix his problem. I am his problem.\"In order to see whether Layne might be having small seizures and in need of a dangerous (for him) CT, House suggests having Layne sing along with a metronome. Layne pauses (cuts out) several times without realizing it.While Wilson tries to comfort House about his current depression Foreman calls with word that Layne's CT was clean.To find the imperfection in his aorta House wants to put pressure on Layne's heart until it tears. They can then repair the damage, so long as he doesn't die first. The team hates the idea, but House goes to Layne with the incredibly dangerous idea anyway. Layne seems okay with the test even though it may mean the end of the career he loves. He is very matter-of-fact about the prospect of moving on to something else and House seems impacted by this. At this exact moment Cuddy walks in needing to talk.In the hall Cuddy tells House she thinks his crazy idea with Layne is an attempt to fill a void. She thinks his judgment has been affected by the drugs. House is adamant she either arrest his team or get out of the way. Cuddy does nothing.During the test Layne's heart has a massive blowout. But Taub, Chase and Foreman are able to repair the damage in time. An almost stunned Foreman says \"It worked\" and Masters smiles.Layne wakes up to Masters sitting in the room. She tells him that he'll be okay as long as he doesn't get his heart rate up too high. She then awkwardly asks him out. He says \"uh\" and she leaves.House watches college kids partying at a bar. The bartender talks about how nice it must be to have your life ahead of you and House stares intently at the group, seeing them in slow-motion as he drinks his scotch.Cut to House up in his room with several empty bottles around him. We see Wilson downstairs asking the bartender about House. House takes several pills and moves to the balcony. He climbs on top of the railing and looks down. We see Wilson moving through the hotel bar and onto its outdoor patio looking for House. Wilson and everyone else look up and see House. House jumps off the balcony as Wilson yells \"No!\" We hear House yell \"cannonball\" as he assumes that position and lands in the pool. Under the water he smiles. He surfaces and is joined in the pool by dozens of drunk college kids. House pumps his fist and chugs a beer. Wilson shakes his head and walks away.", "episode_12": "Open at a diner. A couple is having dinner and the waitress asks the woman if she wants her regular order. The woman claims she's never been there before, but the waitress remembers everything down to her shirt. This causes the man to realize the woman was there with another man and the waitress turns away in embarrassment. She falls to the ground, unable to move her legs.House (Hugh Laurie) discusses the 33-year old waitress, Nadia (Tina Holmes), one of a handful of people in the world who can remember every single thing that's happened to them since adolescence. The plan is to search her work and home for more info. House also mentions that Taub (Peter Jacobson) recently failed his pathology re-certification exam and could be fired if he doesn't pass the re-test (he had the flu). This bothers Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) so House makes Taub pick a tutor. Foreman (Omar Epps) is the winner.House overhears a patient tell Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) to give \"Sarah\" a kiss. Wilson tells him Sarah is nothing but passes on a happy hour trip. Cuddy tells House she has no idea who Sarah might be.While Foreman and Taub search Nadia's home, Taub says he knows someone who would sell a copy of the test. They find laxatives.House searches Wilson's car for clues on Sarah and finds a mysterious bag in the trunk. He is worried about what he's found.Chase (Jesse Spencer) and Masters (Amber Tamblyn) give Nadia an exam. Afterwards, House asks her about her clumsiness. She recalls that the past year she fell twice as many times as the two years previous. They wonder if this might mean early onset Parkinson's.House had discovered Sarah is Wilson's new cat. He's upset because he thinks Wilson is becoming a male spinster.Nadia tells Masters her memory is \"just there.\" Her sister Elena arrives and Nadia isn't happy. While complaining Elena brought her least favorite kind of flower, Nadia starts having chest pain.Masters wonders if Nadia's heart could be the issue. They plan a stress tes,t but can't put her on the treadmill.Cuddy doesn't think House should worry about Wilson's cat. He says after Wilson's second divorce, he bought a cat and stopped leaving the house.The docs have Elena in the room with Nadia is hooked up to the machines in the hopes she will get worked up again. When nothing happens, Chase sends Masters in there and has her bring up a bad memory, when Elena accidentally hit Nadia with her car. Nadia becomes furious and her heart rate goes through the roof.Foreman comes to Taub's hotel room to study. Taub continues to procrastinate and Foreman eventually leaves.In the hall, Elena tells Masters that Nadia has banned her from the room. She says her sister never lets anything go. When Masters says she tried to get them mad at each other on purpose, Elena is even angrier. When Masters returns to the room, she smells Nadia's breath and can determine her kidneys are failing.House tells Foreman if Taub doesn't pass the test, he'll be in charge of the team's insurance forms. The plan for Nadia is dialysis.Wilson has been sneezing at home. He realizes House has planted something in the apartment to make him think he's overreacting. House makes him promise to join him for a boys night out.Nadia has trouble breathing during dialysis.Taub and Foreman study at Foreman's place.House figures out Nadia is allergic to the dialysis. This means she has some sort of auto immune disease and will die soon without a transplant.The only hope for Nadia seems to be Elena. They start to discuss that Nadia seems to keep score of every memory and see if people are objectively good or bad for her. House puts Master in charge of seeing if she'll donate.Elena pretty quickly agrees to donate one of her kidneys.Taub admits to Foreman during a study break. He didn't have the flu when he failed his first test -- \"I just choked.\" He got a perfect score when he first took his boards and was nervous about not measuring up.The surgery goes well but as Chase wakes up Nadia from the anesthesia, she begins seizing.The team has no real answers right now about Nadia's condition. The next step is to look at her blood and House is curious to learn if Nadia thanks her sister.After a 54 percent on a practice test, Taub starts to panic. Foreman tries to pump him but ultimately Taub buys the test copy.Nadia doesn't feel great as they work on resolving the clots. She asks to see her sister.Wilson spots a Barista from his local place at the bar. She's always been nice to him and he goes to talk to her. The two leave together. House is so happy he buys the room champagne.Nadia thanks Elena for saving her life. Elena tells her sister she loves her and the conversation starts well. But quickly Nadia flashes back to the car accident and starts getting upset. She cries and says \"I can't do this.\"In the hall, Chase points out the reason she is in the diner away from her friends and family is because she can't forgive anyone. \"I don't have a choice,\" she says. She starts having involuntary hand twitches.Cuddy figures out House feels guilty he's not alone and Wilson is. Foreman calls with the hand twitch info, which rules out the clotting disorder. When Foreman makes a comment about puzzles, House heads to the hospital.In Nadia's room, House asks her a few questions and figures out she is OCD. Her way of filtering the OCD is doing puzzles and holding memories. She has a genetic disorder which affects the blood, heart and brain and has no cure. She will probably only live 20 more years.Taub gives Foreman his TV and this leads to a discussion of him moving in while he looks for a new place.Chase tells Nadia she can take SSRIs, drugs which can help OCD. In her case, they will give her a normal memory. She responds her memory is the only thing making her special. He says she'll have to choose between being special and being alone.Wilson admits to House that he choked with the Barista and just walked her to her car. He says he's just not ready to get out there. House allows him ten days.We see a montage which includes Nadia taking the drugs.", "episode_14": "Open with a man cleaning up what looks to be a bloody crime scene. His phone rings with his wife and it's clear that she thinks he has a completely different job. The man, Bert, arrives at dinner with his wife and she tells him there will be no discussion of real estate on this, their third anniversary. He eats a sketchy looking appetizer and begins breaking out into a strange rash.House is ducking Cuddy because she is about to receive an award at a charity function he isn't excited about attending. But he does tell her that he has already RSVP'd. Taub has borrowed one of Foreman's ties and he seems a little ticked. House says that our man Bert has not tested positive for any known allergy. Masters says she thinks he's lying about being a real estate investor since his hands show the signs of manual labor. After tricking his wife Diane into leaving, the docs ask Bert about his real job. He says he lost his entire real estate company in the recession and now does industrial cleaning -- septic tank repair, crime scenes -- to make ends meet. House is going to look into getting autopsy results from the homicide Bert was cleaning up and sends Taub and Foreman to the office where he hides out during the day.Wilson bets House $200 he won't show up at Cuddy's thing. He then admits Cuddy is behind his wager. Foreman finds Vicodin at Bert's work, then Taub notices a closet filled with chemicals.After Chase tells Bert they think he's suffering from boric acid exposure his fever spikes dramatically. This fever rules out the acid exposure and the autopsy report did not reveal any communicable diseases. Vicodin shouldn't cause his symptoms so House wants them to see if he's been lying about anything else. Bert says the Vicodin was to hide manual labor pain from his wife. House tells Wilson he's looking for a way to spice up the charity event. Masters rips Chase for the way he treats women, sleeping with different ones each night. Another round of tests on Burt bring the team back to square one and they all get a page.Bert is getting worse and can barely move his legs. The docs roll down the sheets and see his feet are turning black. They managed to restore circulation to Bert's feet. House orders the team to attend the charity event and decides to give Bert steroids in case he's suffering from an insect bite.Taub tells Foreman his wife is no officially seeing her online buddy. Foreman, whose date cancelled, agrees to have dinner with him at home. Taub will cook. That night during video games Taub tells Foreman he needs to lighten up. Both start getting food sickness symptoms. Bert has locked himself in the bathroom of his hospital room. Inside we see him appear to hallucinate, imaging the walls closing in on him and blood pouring from the faucet.Bert's rash is gone and Foreman thinks their treatment could have caused his psychotic break. The next suggestion (made while House, Chase and Masters stand outside the stalls while Foreman and Taub poop) is a fungus. Before treating Bert's wife Diane, he decides to tell her the truth. House auditions mariachi bands for Cuddy's big night. Wilson thinks he's making a mistake. After being told the truth Diane leaves the room and tells Masters (who though honesty would be for the best) that their marriage is over. Bert's fever is back up and is now having hearing issues. Bert (who is negative for sports or funguses) has almost completely lost his hearing. The new theory is that he has something in his brain, perhaps a tumor. Taub says he is going to move out. He would rather remain friends with Foreman than be roommates. Cuddy tells Wilson she's worried House will embarrass her. She makes a comment about liking mariachi bands. Before his MRI Bert asks about Diane. They tell him she's not back. He starts seizing during the test. Both Bert's kidneys are fried and he's in a coma. He's near death. Though they could confirm a tumor via MRI, House thinks they should try chemo to give him a shot. This could kill him a few hours quicker if they're wrong so they'll need Diane's consent. House tabs Masters for the unpleasant assignment. Masters tells Chase she has a difficult time making friends and can't even find a date for the charity event. Chase tells Masters to be honest with Diane but err on the side of hope over brutal truth. Diane asks if she can talk to her comatose husband and Masters lies and says his hearing is fine.Diane apologizes to her husband for saying terrible things and says she loves him. She says she kept a secret from him as well -- she's pregnant. Masters hears this and sees that Bert's rash is coming back.After Masters mentions Bert was cold in the MRI House figures out he must have a rare autosomal dominant disease called Muckle-Wells syndrome. House orders a course of treatment which should completely cure Bert. House says they're all idiots for not spotting it earlier.When the docs get off the elevator on Bert's floor they see doctors trying to resuscitate him. Masters and Chase rush to Bert's side but it's too late. Bert dies as Diane looks on. A few hours before Cuddy's event Wilson apologizes to House for being cynical about his plans. Foreman says Taub doesn't have to move out if he doesn't want to. They both apologize for saying harsh things to each other and shake hands. Chase tells Masters he's going to the event by himself. Cut to House drinking alone at a bar during Cuddy's event. Wilson sits next to him it's clear he's bothered by the patients he's lost over his career. He thinks his relationship with Cuddy has made him a worse doctor. Wilson says Cuddy is worried about House and upset he didn't show. House leaves to tell her the truth and Wilson takes his keys. House arrives at Cuddy's door. She says \"you screwed up\" and he tells her to sit down \"for this.\" He says being happy and being in love with Cuddy \"has made me a crappy doctor.\" He thinks people will die because of his happiness, but says she's \"totally worth it.\" He says he'll always chose being happy and being with her over saving everyone and passes out on her lap.", "episode_8": "Open with what look to be a modern crucifixion. The man is nailed to a cross but it quickly taken down when blood starts pouring out of his mouth.Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) is still mad at House (Hugh Laurie) for lying and wants him to apologize. He doesn't think he has to. She tells him about the man, who is 33-years old and also suffering from fever. We learn the hospital's Chairman of the Board is getting married in a few days and everybody is going.Ramon (Madalyn Horcher), the faux crucified dude, tells House that when his daughter Marissa (Kuno Becker) was diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer and given months to live, he made a bargain with God. For every year she was alive he would nail himself to a cross. That was three years ago and she is now cancer-free. This leads to Hosue arguing with Ramon and Marissa about why she is cancer-free.Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) tells House he's planning to propose to Sam (Cynthia Watros) at the wedding. Their conversation gives House an idea.The team discusses the wedding and we learn that Taub's wife Rachel (Jennifer Crystal Foley) is acting suspiciously. She has an upcoming meeting at a hotel.The test they're running on Ramon make them think he could have a horse infection. Ramon tells the doc his teeth are falling out, which is not a symptom of the horse infection.The team wonders if metal poisoning could be to blame and plan to search Ramon's house.Cuddy won't give House the file for Marissa since Ramon won't consent. He is wearing a conservative outfit for the rehearsal dinner. Cuddy sniffs out he wants her to lie to him and say he looks good so they can be \"even\" in lies.Masters (Amber Tamblyn) and Chase (Jesse Spencer) are in charge of going to Ramon's Spartan apartment. They discover he has basically been starving himself and think malnutrition could be responsible for his symptoms.House tells Wilson he forged Cuddy's signature to get Marissa's file and wants him to look it over. House discovers Wilson going over some of Sam's files. Her boss wants a clinical review of everything and he is helping her to make sure everything is in order.Rachel tells Taub (Peter Jacobson) she met a male friend online in a support group for people with unfaithful spouses.With a huge smile on his face, Ramon tells Masters his legs are killing him. She asks why he's smiling but he insists \"I'm not smiling.\"House suggests Ramon's religious extremism could be a symptom and orders an MRI.House tells Cuddy about forging her signature. He thinks he's caught her in a lie about her age, but she tells him she actually lied on her HR file years ago to get hired.The doctors spot MS on Ramon's MRI. It was hiding behind the malnutrition and only showed back up when his diet improved.House and Ramon have another discussion about faith. Ramon can't feel anything in his right arm.House tells the team Ramon has Margu's variant of MS, meaning he has just days to live. The team knows embryonic stem cell treatment should help him, but doubt someone so devout would accept that type of care.Wilson tells House that Marissa's case seems legitimate. She had aggressive cancer which shouldn't have responded to treatment. House tells Wilson in five of Sam's cases, the stated doses don't explain the radiation damage. Wilson saw the same thing and is concerned. House says it's a good thing, since it means she tried to save her patients' lives and crossed the line a tad.As House and Cuddy leave for the rehearsal dinner, she tells him she doesn't think the marriage of the hospital chairman will last and speaks in specific terms about the state's divorce laws. House gets word Ramon has refused treatment and bails on the dinner.Ramon says accepting the treatment would be going back on his deal with God. House and Masters make a good case, but he won't change his mind. He will gladly die for his daughter.In the hall, Masters suggests they have Marissa talk to her father.Marissa knows what dying is like and doesn't want her father to go through it. If God kills her father, she says, \"I hate God.\" Ramon sticks to his decision.The whole department is at the wedding. Chase is doing very well with the ladies. Taub tells Rachel he doesn't like how close she is with this man on-line. House flatters Cuddy but she is still mad at him.Back at the hospital, Ramon tells Masters that he is surprised Marissa couldn't change his mind. He admits to being scared about dying. He says his beliefs are what define him.Taub asks Rachel to end the relationship. She says she needs it at this point in her life.House finally catches Cuddy in a lie when she says she's never been married. House discovered in her file that she was married for just a few days many years ago. Cuddy admits House caught her but seems hurt more than anything.Wilson proposes to Sam. When he talks about liking that she went the extra mile for her patients, she tells him that she never did that. She says every one of her files was legit and she can't believe he doesn't trust her. She storms out.House leaves the wedding and goes to Ramon's room. He tells Ramon that he used a more advanced scan on Marissa and her cancer has never gone away. Ramon doesn't believe him, but House is persistent. A despondent Ramon finally consents to treatment.House returns two days later and admits to Ramon that he lied about his daughter having cancer to give him the treatment. Marissa is fine and he seems to be responding to the stem cell treatment. House thinks this means God doesn't exist, Ramon takes it to mean God is merciful.Masters was the only member of the team left out of the ruse. She tells House they can't continue to work like that. \"I can,\" House says.Sam packs her stuff and leaves despite Wilson begging her to stay. She can't deal with his lack of trust.House tells Cuddy he's been an idiot. He says \"Maybe it's time I took a leap of faith. I'm sorry, I won't lie to you again.\" She is happy.Wilson arrives at House's place and tells him about Sam. He tells him about apologizing to Cuddy. Wilson thinks this is a good thing. House says \"I lied. I just took your advice.\"", "episode_17": "Two kids fire a rocket off in one of their backyards. It launches, then explodes and lands in the woods. As they try to put out the resulting flames they see a homeless man lying asleep or dead, they aren't certain which until the fire spreads to the man's arm. He comes to and one of the kids puts it out. The man smells his arms and says: \"It smells like licorice.\"House (Hugh Laurie) comes rolling in on a Segway with a brunette on the back. After being told about the 23-year old who thinks his skin smells funny, he thinks they should look into potential neurological problems. He then tells the team he's going to marry the woman he's with, Dominika, on Friday.After the homeless guy tells them he's never had medical problems, Foreman (Omar Epps) notices his chest and back are covered with old burn marks. He says they are the result of an abusive father.House invites Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) to a \"thing\" on Friday. She tells him handicap laws don't apply to Segways, but says she'll allow it.Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) thinks House is trying to \"screw with Cuddy.\" House tells him that Dominika needs a Green Card and is going to work for him several days a week for free.The homeless guy gets a smell test very, very wrong. Taub (Peter Jacobson) and Chase (Jesse Spencer) show up with his belongings which they found in the park. There are hypodermic needles, but he says he's just been trying to \"boost\" his immune system and challenges them to test him. They see his books all have Danny Jennings written on them. He gets nervous and wants to leave, but starts having severe gastrointestinal bleeding.Tests confirm Danny was taking vitamins. But House tests Danny's hair and found out that sometime in the last five years he was taking heroin. To appease a concerned Masters (Amber Tamblyn), House orders an X-Ray of Danny's abdomen.Cuddy agrees to add Dominika to House's insurance early so she can get a tooth capped. That means if he doesn't get legally married, he'll lose coverage with the hospital's carrier.Danny says he's been clean for three months. He changed his life after an OD made him think he'd been given a second chance for a reason.Danny's x-ray shows a number of masses in his colon. They can't be tumors based on the size. House thinks fungus and orders medication and a scope.During the scope, Taub and Foreman find there were pieces of bone in Danny's colon.Danny tells the docs a chef from an Italian restaurant challenges him to eat weird stuff in order to get real food. He then starts having issues with his vision, telling Foreman \"It's like I'm looking at you from the bottom of a well.\"Chase suggests the possibility of a meningioma pressing on Danny's nerves. House orders an MRI. While Cuddy is starting a tour of the hospital with a VIP couple, House attacks her with a toy remote-controlled helicopter.During the MRI, Taub tells Chase he doesn't buy any of Danny's story. Danny starts vomiting. They find two dark spots on the MRI.The team believes schizophrenia may be a possibility.After Wilson tells House he should lay off Cuddy, House admits he's basically taking advantage of Cuddy's guilt after dumping him.Masters suggests several shelters Danny could contact if it turns out he is schizophrenic. All of a sudden, his other arm starts to feel as if it's on fire.House's guess (while he drives the team in a monster truck) is Danny has some sort of genetic disorder.Taub, hurt he isn't part of House's wedding, finds Danny's father and sends Chase and Masters to the house.At the home of Danny Jennings, the docs are told by a man the person by that name was buried three months ago after dying of a drug overdose.\"Danny\" refuses to tell House his real name because his father is looking for him. If he sees his father, he tells House, \"I'll kill him.\" He then is unable to grab a cup on the table.House thinks Danny must have early onset Parkinson's Disease.Wilson goes to Cuddy to complain about House's activity. He thinks House needs someone to be a real boss.Cuddy promptly kicks all of House's wedding arrangements out of the hospital.Masters tells Danny about his disease. He tells her his OD was not accidental, he was trying to commit suicide because \"I've done things, horrible things.\" He thought God forgave him when he didn't die, but now he thinks God wants him to suffer. He says he almost beat a college girlfriend to death: \"I'm evil. I'm just like my Dad. We're both monsters and we deserve to die.\" He says he feels dizzy and his vitals crash.Danny's heart is now failing and the transplant list isn't an option. House wonders why the patient is deteriorating so quickly since he's arrived at the hospital. House figures out Danny has a disorder preventing him from processing the acid in and the vegetarian meals at the hospital have been the problem. He orders they remove the excess chlorophyll from his blood and change his diet.Cuddy walks out of the wedding ceremony just before House says \"yup\" (instead of the traditional \"I do\"). House is married.Wilson follows Cuddy. She tells him she's angry at herself for letting the sham wedding to get to her.Danny is feeling better. Masters tells him if he follows the diet he'll be okay. She suggests he seek professional help. He seems open to the idea. He thinks God has a plan for him and he couldn't have passed this test without Masters' help. He tells her Danny isn't his real name and seems about to tell her. At the door she says: \"It doesn't matter.\"That night Dominika and House seem to have a genuine moment. But he separates from the kiss and tells her he never sleeps with married women. He gives her the couch and goes to his bedroom.Masters arrives the next day to learn Danny disappeared the night before without checking out. The FBI is on site. Chase tells her Danny's DNA testing set off alarm bells all over the country. It turns out Danny is a serial killer who has killed 13 people in ten states and eats his victims.\"And we saved him,\" Taub says.", "episode_13": "We open at a private school of some sort. A girl (Colleen) with a black eye gives a boy (Zack) a note and later they meet behind some dumpsters. She tells him she's finally ready. Just before they kiss, a teacher catches them and brings them to the principal's office. They find House (Hugh Laurie) sitting on the bench.Next, we find House telling the story of investigating the home of a patient, demanding they hack into a laptop in a scene right out of \"Pulp Fiction.\" He was telling this story on a Career Day and the kids call him on his exaggeration. House is re-telling this story to Zack and Colleen. House wants to know why the kids are seeing the principal, and vice-versa. He wants to know how Colleen hurt her eye. She won't tell until House tells more of his story.House (who is being called Dr. Hourani) tries to cut his presentation short with a fake off-color anecdote but the kids are curious about this day-to-day.Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) is upset at House, refusing to have lunch with him. She goes on a tirade and says \"I'm sick of it. I'm done.\"Colleen wants to know why Cuddy was mad at House. To get House to talk, they tell him they were busted almost kissing behind the school.We see a patient (Phillip) coughing and having trouble breathing. While Chase (Jesse Spencer) and Taub (Peter Jacobson) hit on a new nurse, Phillip (Willis Chung) starts coughing blood into his hand.After yet another cinematic flourish, the teacher wants to shut down House and turn the floor over to a Mr. Dryden who a big-deal advertising guy. But the kids want to hear more about Phillip. House (who is still being called Dr. Hourani) tells them Phillip died.The kids don't buy it.As the doctors work on Phillip, he coughs up what Chase says is a piece of his lung.House tells the Career Day kids Phillip is a college student who really did cough a piece of lung into his hand.Masters (Amber Tamblyn) wonders if perhaps Phillip's computer science roommates are fabricating chips and working with toxic materials. House thinks Phillip has Sarcoidosis but wants to go with Foreman (Omar Epps) so he can get into the laptop he's trying to search.House tells the kids the laptop belonged to his girlfriend. He says he stole Cuddy's computer in an attempt to fix things with her. One again House tries to turn the floor over to Dryden but the kids want him to finish.We see House spilled some chemicals in a waiting room to distract Cuddy long enough to get her computer.House tells Colleen (and earlier Wilson) he stole Cuddy's computer to try and read her journal. Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) gives her some suggestions for passwords.The Career Day kids seem surprised House was annoyed by Foreman asking him questions about the dying Phillip while he was trying to get into Cuddy's Apple. House reminds them not every dying person is interesting.Zack tells House the kiss with Colleen was the result of him winning a bet he could outlast her in double Dutch. He says the bet allowed her to do what she wanted to do without her friends making fun of her. House finally tells the kids.House got in trouble when he wouldn't take out the trash. After he left, Cuddy saw he had used her toothbrush. The toothbrush thing was something Cuddy had mentioned in the past.House tells the kids he treats Cuddy harshly because he respects her enough not to coddle her the way she is at work. This leads to Zack saying a similar philosophy led to Colleen's black eye, which she got when he fired a slap shot at her in floor hockey.The actual Dr. Hourani finds House hiding in his office, finally having broken into Cuddy's journal.Telling this story clues in the Career Day kids to the fact House isn't himself Dr. Hourani.While House sits with Colleen and Zack, Foreman calls to say Phillip was negative for Sarcoidosis. He still wants them to give the same treatment. House points out Sarcoidosis is a diagnosis of exclusion and often patients die before doctors give any treatment.We see more of Cuddy and House's fight. She thinks all House cares about is what he wants. Cuddy says House may love her, but she deserves someone who cares about her.House learned in the journal Cuddy didn't even attempt to get Rachel into her first choice school, since it requires donations or pulling strings. That school is the one he's been at all day. The hospital CEO is a board member at the school. He tells House he might be able to help as long as House does him a favor, presumably helping out at Career Day.On the way to Career Day, Foreman tells House they still don't think its Sarcoidosis or a foreign body. House insists they proceed with the Sarcoidosis treatment just as he rear-ends Dryden. As Dryden approaches House's window, House slips his wallet under the seat.Colleen and Zack realize House gave him a fake name.We cut to Career Day. Dryden realizes during the Hourani story that House isn't who he said he was. Dryden approaches him at the front of the classroom and tries to wrestle House's wallet from his pants. They wrestle back and forth until one of the assistant principals spots them.Colleen tells the story. Zack actually confessed he paid one of the double Dutch rope holders to let him win the bet. He felt bad about getting a kiss he didn't earn and told her to let him know when she was ready. That led to the near-kiss from the opening. Colleen thinks House is like Zack in that way and he should quit playing games.House finally gets in to see Ms. Fields (Erika Alexander), the headmaster of the school. He apologizes for his actions. She has spoken to the CEO. House assures her Cuddy and Rachel will be great additions. He says he needs Cuddy in his life. House spots a poster on the wall for Princess and the Pea and has his revelation.At the hospita,l House tells Foreman it must be food small enough not to show on scans. \"I got $100 it's a pea.\"Cuddy knows what House did at the school. He says he did that (as well as steal her computer) to prove he cares about her needs. He says he was wrong and he can do better if given a chance. Before House gets to the door, Cuddy invites him over for dinner that night. He accepts.", "episode_10": "At a boot camp for troubled youth, the drill instructor yells at a teenage boy complaining about pain and not able to keep up. The drill instructor's back seizes up and the kid is only too happy to let him collapse and suffer without help.A photoshopped picture of a shirtless Chase (Jesse Spencer) featuring comically small genitalia has popped up on his profile at a social media site. The picture was taken in a bathroom during the wedding where Chase slept with three different women. House (Hugh Laurie) arrives and they discuss the drill instructor, 38, who is having urinary blockage and it becomes clear Masters (Amber Tamblyn) has a huge problem with what she deems \"bullying.\" Tests are ordered and House makes it known he's seen Chase's profile.Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) tells House she is looking at first-choice pre-school for Rachel. Though he doesn't say it out loud, House seems uncertain of her intelligence.During his tests, drill instructor Driscoll explains to Masters the reason the kids he works with need such severe discipline. His program has better results than \"juvi-hall\" and Masters is stunned.Chase's password has been changed and he no longer has control over his page. Unfortunately for Chase, he can't remember the names of the women with whom he had sex that night.Driscoll's urinary problem is nerve-related and more tests are ordered. While Masters draws blood, he loses control and grabs her around the neck. High concentration of a few drugs could cause the combination of symptoms Driscoll is experiencing. They consider he might have been poisoned.Chase obtains the names of the girls. House looks into ways he can help Rachel \"prepare\" (cheat) on her pre-school entrance testing, telling Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) he thinks she's dumb.At the camp, Masters continues to complain to Foreman (Omar Epps) about their methods. They talk to the kid from the opening, Landon (Tyler James Williams), who we learn gets it worse from Driscoll than anyone else. He doesn't seem worried about getting in trouble given his mother is dead and he's never met his father. But based on the fact a buddy's allergies are acting up, they suspect Landon may have given Driscoll a large amount of antihistamines.Driscoll has his system flushed and he apologizes to Masters. His heart begins to race and Foreman takes quick action. This latest symptom means Driscoll did not have antihistamine toxicity. The latest on Chase's profile is that he's changed his status to indicate he is only interested in incredibly large women. House orders more tests for Driscoll.House goes to the school pretending to be investigating a medical situation. He catalogues the toys used for the initial interview play dates. During another test, Driscoll tells Masters he knows Landon drugged him. He's had trouble reaching Landon and Masters suggests he should have tried another way. She thinks Landon needs to know Driscoll is on his side.Before going to see the women, Chase analyzes the picture from the hotel room. Taub (Peter Jacobson) estimates the woman was shorter than him.House doesn't have much success during his initial round with the toys. Rachel eats the pieces. The first girl Chase goes to see reminds him that she was wearing heels during their encounter. It couldn't have been her.More dead ends for Driscoll, who is getting worse. They get a call and discover that Landon is in the ER with identical symptoms as Driscoll. Driscoll and Landon are now in the same room. Landon clearly hates Driscoll.Chase's mystery antagonist has now made a donation using his credit card in the name of the one of the hospital's top administrators. The next guess for Driscoll is Lyme disease. When Landon resists Masters' attempt to give him a pill to help him, she goes the route of kindness, explaining the situation plainly and getting him another pillow. He seems to respond and takes the drug. Driscoll tosses over the remote, over which they had been arguing.House is using dog training techniques to teach Rachel the puzzles. To Wilson chagrin, it seems to be working.\nThe second of Chase's girls (part of the threesome) turns out to be 17 and still in high school. But it isn't her.Landon tries to make a dash for the exit. He is in possession of Masters' car keys, which he stole from her pocket. Driscoll has yet another setback as his legs seize up. Kidney dysfunction has to be part of Driscoll's problem. Masters mentions Driscoll seemed to be treating Landon nicer and House (working on a hot sauce training technique to keep Rachel from putting the toys in her mouth) orders them both given the same anti-toxins.While administering the anti-toxins, Masters learns Landon has never actually been in trouble with the law. Unlike every other kid in the camp, Landon was not court-ordered to be there. Driscoll has no immediate answer for why that is the case. The third woman tells Chase she slept him with in order to make her boyfriend jealous. She has no motive to make her cheating public.Masters tells House she found something out after speaking to family services. House goes to see Driscoll after Landon is removed from the room for a procedure. House tells Driscoll he knows that he secretly paid Landon's enrollment to the camp. House thinks the only reason he would do this is if he was dead-beat father trying to get back in his son's life. \"Please, don't tell him,\" Driscoll says.With the family connection confirmed, the teams still has no answer. During this discussion of family, Chase gets an idea. Masters talks to Driscoll about Landon. Driscoll only found out months after Landon's mother died. He doesn't think he can tell Landon because if he dies, all Landon will know is that he was a guy who yelled at him. Masters thinks Landon needs a father more than a drill instructor.Rachel does so well during the play date that one of the employees of the pre-school asks whether Rachel had been coached. Cuddy says she's never done anything and asks Rachel if she'd played the games before. Rachel looks right at House before saying \"No, Mama.\" While with a patient, House is ecstatic. It seems Rachel with her talent of lying means she is really bright.House realizes that the pain meds given to Landon had the same triggering reaction the antihistamines did with his father. House says only they have a genetic similarity and medication and an eventual liver transplant will provide a cure. Driscoll wonders whether two patients in their case could share a liver. When Landon wonders how that would work, Driscoll tells him he is his father.Chase figures out the sister of one of the girls he slept with is to blame. She was sharing a room with her sister and caught him up there when she came to change shoes. She tells him she did all of this because they had spoken for a few minutes but he'd become uninterested when she said she didn't sleep with men on the first date. She thought he had been \"a good guy\" at some point in his life and figured some negative reinforcement was in order. Chase ends up asking her out on a date and she turns him down.Driscoll tells Landon they need to talk, but Landon isn't interested. \"You're my son,\" Drisco says. \"I'm not going anywhere.\" There turns out not to be enough room for Rachel at the school. House tells Cuddy that she'll be fine, since she's \"a smart kid.\" Rachel crawls into his lap and Cuddy smiles.", "episode_18": "Open with House sending a taxi driver outside a prison. Out walks Thirteen and he hands her a martini, which she promptly chugs. In the car he says he knows that she pled down to excessive prescribing but he doesn't know what she did to get in there. She isn't talking.Masters mentions to the team a 36-year old science teacher who started coughing blood. At the time they all get texts saying House will be out for three days. Just as they attempt to clear the room House calls and Masters makes a pitch that the case might be more than just a simple nose bleed. House tells them to run cultures and search the man's home for toxins. House doesn't tell the team about Thirteen. But he isn't taking her home, instead bringing her to a chili cook-off-spud gun competition.Just as Chase wants to write the teacher's (Brian) nose bleeds off as inhaled bacteria from the locker rooms at his school, he starts coughing up some serious blood. House takes Thirteen to buy some clothes while grilling her about what she really did to get put in jail for six months about six months after leaving the team. She still isn't giving up any info. He mentions that she has a background in clean combustion and tells her for four years he's been runner-up to someone named Harold. She will help as long as she can make a \"person stop.\"At Brian's house Taub tells Foreman he's been seeing a new young nursing assistant. Inside they see stacks and stacks of junk of every type. Brian is a hoarder: Plus there is no running water, no electricity, etc. They think there must be a psychological component to his problem. Foreman finds tons of fungus and suggests an infection related to that. House and Thirteen stop at a home. She knocks on a door, a man answers and she promptly knees him in the groin. She returns to the car and says she's hungry. Brian tells Foreman and Taub he's just a \"major slob\" and Taub points out they found saved ear wax. House spills the beans about recently breaking up with Cuddy. When Thirteen realizes he's serious she tells him \"I killed a man.\" Brian doesn't test positive for the fungal infection. The team comes up with the possibility of carbon monoxide and Masters and Chase are selected to return to the home. Thirteen doesn't want to talk about happened, but House continues to fire guesses at her. Curious as to how Taub is able to do so well with younger women, Foreman asks the nursing assistant about him. She tells him he cancelled their date for that night. House and Thirteen make a stop and she fires his potato gun. She isn't impressed and has suggestions for how to make it better. At Brian's home Masters is fascinated. There is no carbon monoxide, but she wants to stick around and learn more. They find raccoon feces and Chase suggests Q fever. At this point they find a woman hiding under a tarp. It turns out Brian's wife Nina is the hoarder and Brian has been living with her. Thirteen buys supplies at a hardware store, telling House she wants to focus on distance and accuracy. Foreman secretly checks out Taub's phone and sees he's meeting someone at his place during his usual workout class. Thirteen and House get to the competition. Harold walks over with an even bigger gun and fires off a shot to intimidate them. House and Harold talk trash. Foreman comes home to find Taub and wife Rachel having sex on his sofa. The night before the competition Thirteen makes a few more adjustment to the gun. She also tells House that one of his earlier guesses was right, she and a guy she met at a coffee shop went back to her place and he OD'd. Brian tells Masters that Nina gradually fell into her current state over the past few years. He says he has an appreciation for her view of what is junk. While Brian seems fine, Nina begins to have heart issues. In the middle of the night House hears Thirteen crying by the window.Nina had a heart attack, which doesn't seem to match with Q fever. They think of another possibility which will require a test at Brian's place. Masters and Chase will go back. Thirteen slips up while telling a family story and references her dad taking \"us\" somewhere. House guesses she has a sibling. From there he goes to \"you euthanized your brother.\" Thirteen says \"congratulations\" and walks away. During Brian's MRI Foreman said he thinks Taub isn't being fair to Rachel by refusing to let her move on with her life. The test is clean. The test at Brian's place reveals nothing by Masters stays to continue looking.House tracks Thirteen down in the woods nearby. She tells him her brother got to the point where he couldn't do it himself. In his lucid moments he told her \"It's time.\" She used gloves so the only crime she could be charged with was the drugs. She is upset, thinking about the time when she gets that sick and nobody is there to help her. House stares at her without emotion and this irritates Thirteen. \"It's no wonder Cuddy broke up with you.\" Back on the range Harold starts talking trash about wanting to get with Thirteeen. House turns his potato gun on Harold. Thirteen meets House at the police station. He shot a spud at Harold but was let off because Harold hit on the sheriff's daughter. House mentions that day would have been his one-year anniversary with Cuddy.Masters arrives in Nina's room with the oldest thing she found in the house, some baby clothes. The team assumes this means infertility and they tell House this via phone. At this point Thirteen (who has been listening to the case the entire time) tells them they aren't considering the opposite. Masters tells Nina they think she has Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. It would explain the symptoms, as well as any miscarriages. She admits to having gotten pregnant three times, which Brian didn't know. He leaves the room in anger. Taub tries to end the fling with Rachel. She says no because she's enjoying the excitement of the current version of their relationship. Brian returns to Nina's room and takes her hand.House tells Thirteen he'll kill her if she needs it done later in her life. She accepts his offer to be his assistant and says she'll be at work on Monday.", "episode_11": "Open with Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) and her sister Julia shopping with their mother Arlene (Candice Bergen). Arlene's heart starts \"doing that weird thing again\" and Cuddy thinks they should take her to the ER.We open with House's team meeting in the morgue to hide from Cuddy. Cuddy finds him, wanting him to treat Arlene. House (Hugh Laurie) isn't sure her mother is actually sick and doesn't want any part of it. After a \"this is my mother,\" we cut to House wearing a lab coat and giving Arlene an initial diagnosis. A \"daily pill\" should keep things under control. Arlene asks him if there is any connection to 15 years of vague symptoms that have never resulted in anything concrete. Before House can make a snarky comment, Cuddy promises they will check her home and run a few tests.At Arlene's home Taub (Peter Jacobson) and Masters (Amber Tamblyn) find pictures of Arlene engaging in graphic sexual acts with a Hispanic man, as well as a Mexican herbal medication.Based on the medication Arlene was taking, House suggests a course of treatment. He tells Cuddy about the pictures.Arlene tells Cuddy about the (married) man in her life and learns Julia has been in the loop the entire time.Rachel (Jennifer Crystal Foley) shows up while Taub is moving. She knows he's worried about money and gets him a job with her lawyer brother (Michael Gladis) as a consultant. The last time they'd been around each other, her brother had broken Taub's nose for cheating on Rachel.Arlene is questioning House based on her online research. He suggests she might be a hypochondriac. She counters the pills he gave her are causing a side effect. He tells her he printed a fake label on some sugar pills. She fires him.Cuddy tells House she had to beg Arlene to stay at the hospital and the only way she'd do it is under the care of Dr. Kaufman, the head of internal medicine. Kaufman calls with word Arlene is having more atrial fibrillation. Cuddy tells House he has to stay on her mother's case in secret.Based on Arlene's wishes, Kaufman refuses to keep House in the loop. He doesn't like being on the hook for any mistakes made in the background.House shows the team he's bugged Arlene's room. Masters is immediately uncomfortable. Chase (Jesse Spencer) suggests leukemia, which is what Kaufman was already treating for. House sends Masters to find a new case and brings the rest of the team into his office. He thinks Arlene might be an alcoholic.House tells Cuddy about his diagnosis and suggests a vitamin treatment which can be done on the sly. She wants to ask Arlene about it. House thinks that's a bad idea. Cuddy assures him they've been honest with each other recently.Cuddy tells Arlene she's worried about her drinking. Arlene is adamant she's not a drunk. Cuddy says \"okay\" but gives her the treatment for alcoholism anyway.Cuddy tells House she's being a coward and wants to be kept out of the loop with her mother's care.Rachel's brother apologizes for hitting Taub and lays out the new job. He needs a non-testifying expert and if a test case works out will pay him 50 grand a year for 15 hours a week. While there, Taub notices an x-ray for a victim Rachel's brother is about to settle with. He represents a pizza company and is going to settle a multi-million dollar suit after the kid's legs were messed up in an accident. Taub thinks he sees a micro bleed in the kid's brain. Rachel's brother says previous doctors said it was nothing and tells him to leave it alone.Arlene has spiked a fever. House' alcoholism diagnosis was wrong, as was the cancer possibility Kaufaman had been testing for.House tells the team Cuddy has fired them as they examine a coma patient. Masters leaves to work on a blood-draw. Afterwards, he tells everyone else the coma case was a way to keep Masters occupied. Kaufman is treating Arlene for auto-immune issues. House thinks endocarditis is a possibility. If he's right, Kaufman's treatment could kill her. One of Kaufman's underlings thinks the same thing but can't convince him. House's suggestion is to switch out the medication Kaufman is giving Arlene without telling anyone. Foreman (Omar Epps) thinks the idea too dangerous on several fronts. House threatens to fire them if they don't go with the plan. Chase is the only one willing to do it.Taub tells Foreman about the kid. Foreman thinks he should leave it alone.Taub goes to see the kid. He tells the mother to follow him to the hospital for a test.Masters goes to see Cuddy and basically rats House out for switching the medication for Arlene.Cuddy yells at House for such a drastic step. He tells her endocarditis \"fits better\" and they need her help to hang the new medication.Cuddy switches Arlene's medication and they have a heart-to-heart about she treats her daughters. It ends with Arlene admitting she has more in common with Julia and likes her more than Cuddy.Foreman shows Taub that he whiffed on the kid having anything wrong with his brain.Arlene begins having an allergic reaction, which obviously confuses Kaufman.Cuddy explains to the team what is happening to her mother, adding Kaufman still doesn't know what they've done. House wants to switch Kaufman's medications again and Foreman is even more against the idea. Cuddy excuses the rest of the team. She tells House she'll do it, just as Masters shows up at the door. Masters says she agrees the latest diagnosis fits. However, she thinks they have to tell Arlene. House tells Cuddy to leave. He then tells Masters if she tells anyone what they've been doing. he'll ruin her career. Her drawing the blood with the coma patient violated the patient's wishes and could get her kicked out of medical school. She realizes he set her up and asks House why: \"Because this patient is the highest priority.\" Masters runs the bathroom and vomits.Rachel's brother slams his head into the wall, breaking his nose again. He's been reported to the bar and he threatens to sue Taub. He's told Rachel and she wants him to stay out of her life.Masters tells Arlene and Kaufman what House has done. Arlene fires Kaufman and wants to be transferred to another hospital. Cuddy starts to set it up for her.House tells Cuddy her mother will die if she lets Arlene leave the hospital. He thinks the problem is that she's letting her mother walk over her. He worried that down the road she'll resent him for killing her mother and demands she \"get me my patient back.\"Cuddy jumps into Arlene's ambulance and convinces her the best chance she has is to stay at her hospital.It works and she stays. While House talks to Arlene he realizes she is unable to distinguish sarcasm. This tells him his latest diagnosis was wrong. Arlene has has Metallosis resulting from wear and tear on her hip replacement.Rachel comes to see Taub after realizing why he did what he did with the kid. She's going to keep her brother away from him.House is ultimately impressed by Masters' principles and keeps her on the team.Arlene shows Cuddy online her poisoning causes exactly the symptoms she'd been experiencing for years. They hold hands as the episode ends.", "episode_21": "Open with the testing of some sort of new missile. Immediately after the successful test one of the scientists who seems to be in charge of the project falls on the floor and begins having a seizure.We see House doing some sort of exercise for his bad leg. It doesn't appear to be going well.House walks into the team meeting chugging water. He doesn't seem all that interested in the patient. He references a second \"interesting puzzle\" and Wilson walks in demanding that House pay him $50 for a boxing bet. House bet on the underdog (Foley) but is convinced his guy took a dive. Wilson gives him one day to prove it. House leaves.Thirteen and Taub give the patient (Dr. Lee) an MRI. Thirteen seems convinced karma is playing a role in someone who designs weapons for a living getting sick.House meets Foley at a diner. The boxer is adamant that he didn't take a dive and assures House that he's just become a terrible boxer. He points out that nobody pays a 12 to 1 underdog to lose.House is convinced Foley has a medical issue, showing Wilson a cell phone picture he says proves he has anisocoria. Wilson isn't convinced.Ceaser, Lee's co-worker/boyfriend, corners House and says that he thinks he knows what's wrong with her, citing her last boyfriend was crazy.Ceaser thinks she's being poisoned by the ex-boyfriend. The team starts treating her with charcoal.Taub and Foreman find a box of empty liquor bottles at Lee's place. She swears she's not an alcoholic, that she's been saving them for a friend's art and has to hide them from a housekeeper.The team realizes there is no reason an alcoholic would keep empty bottles. But Foreman still suggests valium for alcohol withdrawal.Foley comes into the hospital for an EKG that ends up being normal. House thinks something is wrong with him but Foley wants to be left alone.Lee has abdominal pain. Stress is suggested because of the two guys fighting over here, as is kidney issues. Taub points out that they probably need House, who is for some reason ignoring his pager.Foreman asks Wilson to pay House and admit he's right for the sake of their patient. Wilson thinks it's a good thing that House is obsessing over something, even if it's not the primary patient.We again see House struggle with a pretty basic leg exercise. We then see him cook a powder in a spoon and inject it into his arm. He's been doing it for some time.Pancreatitis treatment did not help. The team has nothing. House walks in and asks them a question about his boxer. Taub ignores House and suggests a neurological condition for Lee brought on by an untreated UTI. Foreman hangs back and tells House he thinks something is going on and offers his help. House just walks out.House goes to the gym and tells he thinks he can help Foley return to the form that helped him win his first 20 fights before losing his next five. House surprises him with an injection of epinephrine. He thinks this will drop Foley with a soft punch but nothing happens. Eventually Foley knocks House aside and walks away.Lee crashes, this time with a heart attack. Ceaser (who is bedside) points out she is in fantastic shape.Foreman asks Cuddy to step-in and help House for the sake of Lee. She doesn't seem interested.Thirteen breaks into House's place just as he's injected his mystery powder and calls him an idiot. He tells her his leg has been getting worse and he didn't think he should up his Vicodin dosage. She knows it's not heroin, calls him an idiot, and thinks House must be playing a game of some kind. He tells her that he's been injecting an experimental drug that has re-grown muscle in rats. She calls him an idiot. Total idiot tally: 3.\nImmediately after surgery to implant an internal defibulator Chase notices Lee is having vaginal bleeding. The next suggestion is a blood disorder of some kind. Foreman still thinks a toxin could be to blame. The team is concerned about House and Thirteen is conspicuous with her silence. She doesn't say anything about his self-medicating.House doesn't seem to be making any progress and has runs out of the drug. He visits the scientist in charge of the study and after being assured that higher dosage shouldn't be a problem as long as the subjects are hydrated, House steals a few more baggies of the drug.The latest symptom for Lee is bleeding from her mouth. The nurse says it looks as if her gums were burned.Still no progress for House, who goes right to his stash of Vicodin. Wilson comes to visit, having been told about the drug by Thirteen. He tells Wilson he's stopped taking the drugs because they don't seem to be working. Wilson thinks House thinks all his problems are his leg, wanting to be able to cure his unhappiness.The next guess for Lee is that she's suffering from exposure to radiation. They move her to isolation in order to give her a stem cell transplant. On the way Ceaser seems certain that couldn't be the case.Waiting on the procedure Lee asks to see Ceaser. Foreman says it's too risky to bring more people into the room. They notice she's suffering from engorged genitals.House stops Foley during a run and has him drink eight bottles of water. His latest guess is that Foley has a kidney issue that sent him to the canvas during the fight. It doesn't work.House finally pays off Wilson, breaking some of his stuff in the process.Inflammation of the genitals seems to indicate they were wrong, but since Lee's symptoms have stopped Foreman wants to continue treating for radiation. They are still at a loss.House gets drunk at a bar and goes on a rant about why people consume alcohol. He picks a fight with a patron. Just before being punched in the eye House notices he is able to hold himself up with his bad leg.The team wants to treat Ceaser for the same condition, telling him he also needs a bone marrow transplant. He says 'no,' and Chase points out this means he know what's been hurting her. They have figured out that he was poisoning her and she's finally better only because he hasn't been near her. They're having his place searched as they speak.House is able to lift his leg in a way he never could before. He's moving around the house without his cane. He accidentally hits himself in the head with the cane and thinks of something.House is hitting the heavy bag at the gym when Foley arrives first thing in the morning. House takes his cane and pokes Foley in the back of his neck. Within a second he falls to the ground.Thirteen tells Lee that Ceaser was poisoning her because he found she was seeing yet another guy on the side. He'd been giving her Spanish Fly, which has an active ingredient which causes similar damage to radiation.House tells Wilson he's figured out their bet. Foley has an abnormal growth of nerves in his neck caused by a tumor and the clinch before the punch is what knocked him down. He'll be fine but will never be able to box again.House goes home and pulls the experimental medication out of the trash.The episode ends with the scientist coming into the lab and fining one of the rats lying dead on the treadmill.", "episode_15": "Cuddy awakens to an empty bed. She gets up and as she starts for the bathroom a hand reaches out from under bed and grabs her ankle! It's House! He's very playful and pulls her down to him. She tells him that she has to pee and he lets her up, saying that it's okay, he has a book. Which he does. Seconds later Cuddy comes out to tell him that there is blood in her urine.As House leaves Cuddy for her exam, the team talks about a new case: 16-year old Ryan (Brett DelBuono) spit up blood during a pick-up basketball game and the ER found no source in his lungs or GI tract.During his first exam with Ryan, Taub (Peter Jacobson) notices the boy is depressed. Ryan says scratches on his belly aren't from cutting but admits to having smoked pot.Cuddy's lab results are fine, but she schedules an ultrasound of her kidneys. House thinks that as hospital administrator she should not have to wait in line for the test. She politely disagrees.Ryan is thankful Taub didn't tell his parents about the pot. Taub confides back in medical school he too had depression issues and \"ended up hurting myself.\" He notices reds spots in Ryan's eyes.Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) performs the ultrasound and notices a mass in Cuddy's kidney.House clearly is unable to focus on Ryan's case. He suggests they treat Ryan for staph.After hacking into her schedule, House finds out Cuddy is meeting with her lawyer to set up a trust for Rachel. He thinks she should wait until the biopsy the following day before overreacting.A peer comes to the hospital looking for prescription drugs Ryan sold him but wasn't able to deliver before getting sick. Taub takes Ryan's word for it when he says it was a one-time thing and gives him money to repay the guy.Julia agrees to be Rachel's guardian.We see one of Cuddy's dreams. It involves Rachel getting cartoonishly poor parenting from House after Cuddy died, seeming to be a parody of Two and a Half Men.After Masters (Amber Tamblyn) congratulates Taub on being so trusting in Ryan, he immediately has second thoughts. Ryan tells them he has blood in his urine.House tells the team about Cuddy's mass, still unable to fully concentrate on Ryan's case. The plan is to search Ryan's house for drugs.An hour before Cuddy's biopsy, House is upset with Wilson for not comforting her. He is unable to be there for her himself.Chase (Jesse Spencer) sits with Cuddy prior to her biopsy. She thinks House will eventually show up.At Ryan's house, Taub finds a yearbook with some disturbingly violent doodling. They get word Ryan's lost all feeling in his right arm.We get yet another dream sequence, this one consisting of House trying to save Cuddy from the rest of the team members in zombie form. This is House's dream.House searches for info on Cuddy's tests while the team discusses Ryan. He orders tests for Ryan and has Masters examine recent biopsies to find which one is Cuddy's. The team isn't sure if the yearbook should be an issue or not.Wilson again rips House continuing to avoid Cuddy. Masters comes in with word. Cuddy's biopsy was inconclusive. They won't know if she has cancer until they remove it in surgery. Cuddy is currently undergoing some imaging and House looks nervous.House is now hiding at Foreman's place playing video games. Foreman (Omar Epps) also thinks he's making a mistake by not being with her.We next see a black and white dream sequence, this time Cuddy and House's life as it were a \"Leave It To Beaver\" ideal. Rachel's doing great and Cuddy is 29 again. \"None of this is possible,\" she says. Wilson shows up at her door with the scans.House gets a call from Wilson with word additional masses have been found on her lungs, a typical sign of kidney cancer metastasizing. \"She's dead,\" House says after hanging up.Taub has taken some videos from Ryan's flash drive. They show him detonating pipe bombs in the woods and making threats about doing something to his school. Taub thinks he should show the police, but Foreman and Chase aren't sure. Nobody knows the whereabouts of House.Wilson tells Foreman that Cuddy still thinks he'll show up. Wilson doesn't seem sure.Taub tells Kay (Lesley Fera) and Todd (Ken Garito), Ryan's parents, the plan is to go into his brain to remove a clot. He mentions the video and they point out he'll probably be expelled. The father wants them to concentrate on getting the son well before worrying about anything else.Taub continues to battle with himself over whether he should tell the cops what he knows.Ryan's clot disintegrates during surgery and Foreman and Chase don't know why.Yet another dream sequence, this one with House and Cuddy as Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid - the famous final scene of the movie where they take on an army. She is worried House might not be able to handle what is happening. \"It might be too late,\" she says in the dream. She notices that he's eating in the dream and mentions that he's been eating in all her dreams, which Dream House tells her is a sign of stress in her real life.Cuddy wakes up to find House standing by her bed. He apologizes for not being there and they hold hands.With House now at Cuddy's side, the team has to figure out what's happening with Ryan without him. They aren't sure what was in his brain or why his liver function is deteriorating so quickly he'll be dead in a day. Cuddy has her surgery and the team still has no clue.We get yet another dream sequence, this one a big Broadway song and dance number featuring House performing \"Get Happy.\" Cuddy joins in as they repeat the refrain: \"Forget your troubles, come on get happy.\" House's cane turns into a giant candy cane and Cuddy frowns at it as they dance.Cuddy wakes up from surgery and House tells her she doesn't have cancer. The mass was benign and the spots on her lungs were an allergic reaction to medication. At this point, House thinks of something related to Ryan's case.He's figured out Ryan really did have a staph infection, caused by an abscess. Taub guesses the source was the scratches on his stomach, from by plastic shrapnel from the bombs.Julia sits with Cuddy after she returns home from the hospital. Before leaving, she makes reference to moving pills out of the reach of Rachel, saying \"I worry because Rachel always calls them candy\". Cuddy gets that look of epiphany usually reserved for House.Cuddy shows up at House's place and tells him he must have been on Vicodin when he visited her before surgery. He confesses. He asks her how she knew and she says that her subconscious had been trying to tell her (each dream had house eating something - a lollipop, the candycane, etc. - when her sister mentioned Rachel thinking drugs were candy - it clicked). This leads to her having a revelation House will never be able to put her first. She breaks up with him over his heart-breaking protestations.We see quick shots of Cuddy crying and Taub mailing a video to the police. We next cut to House sitting on the floor of his bathroom with pills in his hand. He takes two and pops them in his mouth.", "episode_23": "Open with Cuddy watching some kind of emergency scene. We see Wilson getting treatment. She describes for an officer some kind of incident that took place with House and says if he ever comes near her again she wants him put in jail.THREE DAYS EARLIERHouse is watching video of performance artist Afsoun Hamidi on his laptop in bed. Hamidi's surrounded by various items and her assistant (Luca) tells a group of people they can use them on her in any way. House references that Hamidi is a patient. The video resumes and a man covers Hamidi in paint thinner. The man lights a match but Luca (who has been instructed not to intervene) pushes him away. Hamidi then falls over. The team debates whether Hamidi's work is actually art. Since there was a space heater next to her in the gallery they elect to put her in a hyperbaric chamber in case carbon monoxide poisoning was the issue.Cuddy runs into a man named Jerry at a coffee shop. Her sister has been trying to set them up and he recognizes her from pictures. She basically blows him off.House and Cuddy talk about returning each other's belongings. House wants things to return to the way they were before they dated and he assures her he's making changes to his life. She wants him to explore the reasons why he performed surgery on himself. He eventually agrees to lunch the following day. House is still taking Vicodin.While Hamidi lies in the chamber we learn that she and Luca used to date but are no longer together. She discusses the philosophy behind her art with Foreman. Hamidi begins to vomit in the chamber. When Thirteen asks Luca to hand her an oxygen mask nearby he pauses, as if in shock.Taub gives Ruby an ultrasound. Rachel calls him but he ignores it, telling Ruby it was House.Cuddy's sister tells her she should think about dating Jerry. Cuddy's annoyed she was meddling in her personal life.House has Thirteen go into Hamidi's room and investigate a stuffed elephant Luca brought with him to the hospital. She looks inside and sees that it is a nanny camera. Luca hesitated earlier, House realizes, because they are now part of her next piece of art.(This re-capper's local TV station cuts into the broadcast for severe weather coverage.)Foreman tells House that Hamidi is a fraud, that she's been injecting herself with her own red blood cells which caused her heart issues. Looking at browser history on her laptop Foreman discovered that for months she'd been researching both blood-doping and House himself. \"She set you up,\" he tells House.We cut to the scene from the opening. An investigator tells Wilson they've seen officers to look for House. Wilson says they won't find him at his home, that he'll be at some dark, depressing bar.Hamidi tells House she's exploring her own illness in this new project. The blood-doping was done to \"intrigue\" House, but she was already sick. She isn't going to tell House what is wrong, because then he won't have a game and they won't have the art. House still is interested.The team doesn't like giving her a bed since there is no way to tell if she's even sick at all. Thirteen agrees to help run tests on her.(This re-capper's local TV station again cuts into the broadcast for severe weather coverage.)Thirteen tells Hamidi has cysts that cannot be faked. House thinks her actions indicate she has something fatal.During a scan House tells Luca that the reason she cut off her hair during an art project a few months back was that she knew it was going to fall out anyway and wanted to hide the reason. House then finds a tumor on her brain and she admits to both he and Luca that four months ago a hospital in New York told her it was inoperable. It was at that time she broke up with Luca. House tells her he doesn't think this latest project means anything. He thinks she may have just been hoping for a different diagnosis.Wilson goes to see House. He's cutting off House's ability to get Vicodin using his name and notices that House has taken almost a month's supply of the drug in three days. He's worried about House and wants House to deal with the anger instead of medicating the pain.House discharges himself from the hospital against doctor's orders. On his way out he stops into Hamidi's room. She is complaining of what she believes to be eczema on her chest. House says it's not eczema and \"it's not cancer.\"Hamidi has Wegener's granulomatosis. It can be treated with steroids, but the safest way to treat the mass in her brain is with another course of radiation. She doesn't want to have her thinking dulled again and refuses the treatment. Luca is furious that she would let herself die and leaves.House and Cuddy have lunch. After an awkward moment she tells him there is a special hairbrush she would like back. He asks if she is dating anybody. She tells him no. She thinks House has unresolved issues, one of which is her. He ends up storming out, but she follows him. Ultimately he grabs her and says \"I feel hurt.\" She takes his hand and apologizes. He responds \"It's not your fault\" and walks away.Hamidi wonders out loud to Thirteen if she's made the wrong choice. Thirteen wonders if maybe the reason she did this latest art piece was to have Luca with her this time around.Cuddy re-introduces herself to Jerry. They make small talk and laugh.Rachel arrives at the hospital and tells Taub she is pregnant.Thirteen tells House that Hamidi has changed her mind about radiation. House goes to her room. Luca is there and he tells him to leave. House then berates Hamidi for the change of course. He calls her a \"pathetic hypocrite\", and Hamidi asks him \"Why are you doing this?\". He leaves.House sits at home taking more Vicodin. Wilson shows up and offers to take him for a drink. They stop at Cuddy's so that House can drop off the hairbrush. House walks halfway to the door and sees that Cuddy is inside having dinner with her sister and Jerry. He stops, turns around and gets back into the car. He tells Wilson to get out of the car and drives down the block and turns the car around. House then floors it towards Wilson, turning up Cuddy's front lawn and driving the car into her dining room. Nobody inside seems injured. House gets out of the car and hands Cuddy the hairbrush.Cut to House drinking at a bar. He tells the bartender he's had enough to drink and he's leaving. We see that he's on a beach in some tropical location. House smiles at the ocean and starts walking down the beach.", "episode_7": "We open on a slave ship centuries ago. It seems a section of the slaves have an illness and the some of them are tossed overboard. Eventually the ship is sunk to contain the infection.Cut to a family on a boat scuba diving. The daughter surfaces with an ancient-looking jar. She drops it and cuts her hand on the glass.The daughter, a 16-year old, is at the hospital presenting with smallpox. House (Hugh Laurie) calls the CDC and they tell him it is possible the disease could remain active for that long in a sealed jar.Masters (Amber Tamblyn) and Taub (Peter Jacobson) draw blood from the daughter and vaccinate the rest of the family. The parents are beginning to panic.Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) is being nice to House and this worries him.One of Wilson's cancer patients (Eve) wants a special stuffed animal before treatment. The mother will go home and get it for her. House calls Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) away to tell him he thinks Cuddy knows he faked the blood test.Taub tells House it can't be smallpox based on the initial round of tests. House disagrees because she is a diver and the disease could be hiding. He wants them to search her joints and bones.Cuddy tells House she knows and wants him to apologize for lying to her face. House doesn't think he should because he did it to save a patient. She isn't happy.While taking samples from the daughter's bones, Taub spots marking behind her knee. \"I'm sorry,\" he tells her. \"I have to call the CDC. I think you do have smallpox.\"While examining the daughter, they find a rash under her armpit. House says this means it's not smallpox.Wilson talks to Sam (Cynthia Watros) about House's situation with Cuddy. She seems to agree with House and this surprises him. An announcement says the CDC has locked all hospital exits.Doctors from the CDC's Infection control show up. House explains he doesn't believe she has smallpox, but Dr. Broda (Dylan Baker) bullies the team away from the area. They will have no more access to the family.The team is forced to sit and wait. House has access to the captain's log from the ship with the sick slaves. It is in Dutch, so House calls an online video stripper and emails her the PDF to translate. The captain brought his cat. The records say only the slaves had the disease, meaning it wasn't airborne. Masters suggest drinking water differences could mean they had tuberculosis cervical lymphadenitisHouse takes Foreman (Omar Epps) outside and says he wants to lie to the CDC in order to test for TB. He didn't want to tell him in there because of Masters.Foreman talks to Broda, who gets suspicious. During the conversation, the father drops to the floor complaining of a headache before blood starts pouring out of his nose. Broda tells Foreman he's not getting access to the family.The team still thinks it is TB.House brings Chase (Jesse Spencer) into the hallway and wants him to go to the CDC with another lie. Masters comes out into the hallway and hears they don't trust her. She thinks they should go to the CDC with the truth.Sam helps Wilson spend time with Eve, whose mother can now not get into the hospital.Broda agrees to CT the father's brain.The CT stops when they find pustules. The doc tells House the father has smallpox.The consensus is now that both the daughter and father has smallpox.Masters wants to take a closer look at the rash but the CDC won't let her. She walks to the glass and asks the daughter to show her the rash. Masters notices there are no lesions on the bottoms of her feet.Wilson visits with Eve, who is getting upset about not having the right stuffed animal.Masters tells Broda the daughter can't have smallpox. She doesn't have pustules on her palms or soles of feet, but the father does.This gives House an idea and he runs to the team. He thinks the vaccine they gave the father caused him to get smallpox. The father had kidney cancer six years ago and House thinks it must be back. They still don't know what the daughter has.Broda still won't open the door, but when House notices red blood in the urine bag, he is convinced this means the cancer is back. House barges in without a suit to give the father interferon. Broda says he hopes House is right \"because I can't let you out now.\"While House is inside, he and Cuddy discuss their argument further. She wants him to put the suit on, but he feels it's unnecessary. The father calls House over and says \"I'm getting worse aren't I.\" House looks mildly concerned and asks Cuddy to get his team.Sam explains to Eve that \"sometimes adults mess up.\"With the interferon still not working, House now has a suit on. The father's symptoms are textbook smallbox and Foreman tells him he made a mistake going into the room.Cuddy asks House if he has any symptoms. He does not. The father takes a turn for the worse and asks House whether he is going to make it or not. House tells him he should say goodbye to his family and he says his final words to all of them. While talking to his son, the father flat lines. House works on him, but he dies. Broda refuses to let House to another isolation area.The team talks options. Masters goes back to the stripper for more translation. They learn the captain's cat died and before it died it lost its fur. Masters points out animals do carry rickettsial pox and the guys jump to their feet.Broda won't let them examine the dead father's body for evidence of the rickettsial pox. Instead he wants to bleach the body for safety's sake, but that would remove all evidence of the pox. Masters runs over to House and tells him he must look at the body himself. At first House doesn't want to go near it, but eventually looks at body over, even taking off his gloves. Just as the CDC guys come in, House finds evidence and they start the daughter on antibiotics.Eve is released to see her mother. Wilson says Sam was good with her and suggests they have a baby.The daughter is going to be okay but the family is shattered.Cuddy still isn't close to forgiving House.", "episode_20": "Open with a wealthy man (Cyrus) going door-to-door looking for a long-lost love of his named Jennifer. We learn his limo driver is a cousin (Phil) he's paying six figures. After yet another woman with the same name turns out not to be the woman he spent a weekend with years ago, he falls over, unable to move his leg.House's team discusses Cyrus' case (partial paralysis and all the usual scans are clear) and it turns out he is a refrigerator mechanic who recently won $40 million in a lottery. Thirteen (Olivia Wilde) and House (Hugh Laurie) both seem down on the idea of lotteries bringing you happiness. Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) shows up and tells House her mother Arlene (Candice Bergen) is threatening to sue the hospital because she feels her treatment slowed her recovery. The plan is to search Cyrus' old workshop.Arlene is having issue with her hip. Based on the treatment they gave her, House could be in trouble if she sues. Arlene and her attorney (David A. Kimball) want to meet. Cuddy asks him to come and be respectful. He declines.Cyrus (Donal Logue) tells Taub (Peter Jacobson) he doesn't want to be a clich\u00e9 and has been careful with his money since winning three years ago. He tells him he eats all of his food out of cans.Chase (Jesse Spencer) and Foreman (Omar Epps) look through Cyrus' workshop. Chase's thinks Foreman is repressed, and tells him he's given up sex to try and be prepared for a real relationship. He challenges him to not let House get under his skin. They find some cheap Chinese solvent.House wants them to put him on dialysis. Foreman and Thirteen disagree.Thirteen and Taub learn Cuddy has de-authorized all treatment of Cyrus until House meets with Arlene. House's plan is to discharge Cyrus in an attempt to force Cuddy's hand. During that process, a woman walks into the room. It's Jennifer (Megan Follows). Cyrus immediately vomits on her. Thirteen says he's having a focal seizure.Cuddy says she'll let House's team treat Cyrus if he meets her halfway. He asks for some major concessions. She gives up, saying she doesn't care anymore. House feels he's won.At the next meeting, Foreman is connected to a heart rate monitor. They discuss the several possibilities for Cyrus, including hypotension. Thirteen thinks the return of Jennifer won't make Cyrus happy. Foreman's stats don't budge. Thirteen suggests they look at herpes encephalitis. House tells Foreman he disconnected him from the machine a minute earlier, meaning Foreman rigged the machine. House is not curious why Thirteen is so convinced Cyrus will always be miserable, no matter what changes in their life.Jennifer tells Cyrus she doesn't want his money. She only came to see how he was doing. He convinces her to stay a few more days.House asks Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) why he hasn't been critical of his stance with Arlene. Wilson responds - House is in the right this time, perhaps accidentally. House realizes Cuddy must have been using reverse psychology to keep him away from the meeting.Arlene meets with Cuddy. Cuddy thinks this is about their relationship. Arlene wants $30,000. Cuddy says this will lead to an investigation which could cost her and House their licenses. House shows up and is a jerk, chasing Arlene away with a promise of a lawsuit.Along with the tumor they already knew Cyrus had on his pancreas, Taub and Foreman find two more cancers on two of his other organs.Wilson suggests to House that he doesn't like that Cuddy tricked him. He's going to hold a \"summit meeting\" so they can get together and try to avoid a lawsuit.Foreman is again monitored at the next meeting. House suggests giving Cyrus vascular growth factor (give him more cancer) to figure out what the cancers have in common. Foreman's BP goes through the roof and he tears the monitor off his arm. House orders giving him the factor. House brings an old high school boyfriend of Thirteeen's, thinking him dumping her is what caused her negativity. She tells him he dumped her because she hooked up with his sister.When Cyrus is presented with the consent for to receive the additional cancers, he asks Jennifer to marry him.

House tells Foreman to embrace who he is.Wilson and Cuddy find House hiding in a patient's room. Cuddy thinks House \"needs to get over it\" to save both of their jobs. Wilson steps in and orders Cuddy to cut Arlene a check and House to say \"I'm sorry.\" Wilson says if House doesn't do it, he'll cut off his Vicodin supply.Cyrus tells Thirteen that just playing the lottery all those years gave him hope of finding Jennifer and changing his life. He thinks she's just sad, \"can't stand to see somebody happy.\"Arlene is not helpful. She demands more money and implies Cuddy might come after her house. The discussion breaks down. Arlene then rips up her daughter's check.Foreman has paid an attractive new female employee $100 to slap Chase when he inevitably hits on her. He and Taub watch them together. She flirts with Chase for a few moments, then comes into their room. She slaps Foreman and gives him back the money.During a follow test, Cyrus talks to Jennifer about changing his will to leave her everything. She says he's being silly, and should think about what's mattered to him year in and year out over the years. Taub finds that not only are there no new cancers, but the existing ones have shrunk.Foreman is on another BP monitor for the next meeting. His BP rises as they talk about what is going on with Cyrus. Foreman disagrees with House's suggestion of chemo and his BP skyrockets. Foreman tells them he took a beta blocker so the machine can't be right. Chase admits he'd rigged the machine the last two times. Thirteen tells House \"we are who are and lotteries are stupid.\"House has been given tons of new clinic hours and is treating the patients terribly. Arlene wants another meeting but House and Cuddy are ignoring her. Wilson tells House he is clinging onto the argument because he wants to hang onto something related to Cuddy. He points out tnot only is House risking his job, but any future chance of having a relationship with Cuddy.Cyrus gives Phil (David Costabile) a check for $10 million, saying it's the least he could do for a family member who had been his friend for years. Phil accepts. Thirteen notices Jennifer is wearing both contact lenses and glasses. Cyrus gets suspicious and asks Jennifer where a nickname of theirs came from. She says she's forgotten.

Good thing too, since his stats crash.Cyrus had a heart attack and both his lungs and liver failed. The team is at a loss. A siren goes off.It turns out to be a false alarm called in by Arlene in an attempt to meet with Cuddy and House. She begins to discuss the lawsuit. House correctly guesses this entire ordeal is her way of trying to get them back together. This started when Cuddy asked her to move in, meaning she didn't think she'd reconcile with House. She thinks her daughter's standards are too high and was trying to create a common enemy.This helps House figure out Cyrus has a Teratoma in his abdomen. Usually harmless, the growth is filled with primitive cells which have leaked into his blood cells and destroyed systems. House thinks if they cut out what is left of his cancer, he'll be fine.We see Chase has slept with the woman from earlier.Foreman is testing his own BP.A woman shows up in Cyrus' room. It's the real Jennifer.Thirteen and House watch Cyrus and Jennifer from the hallway. She's concluded that since Cyrus is hopeful, he will always be happy.

She's doing it to keep sharp while working with House. Her roommate reminds her today is her last day as a medical student. She is one lumbar puncture (LP) away from being finished.At a hospital a scummy student named Cruz has taken the last LP from her. He tells Masters that for the first time ever House has listed an intern spot on his team, clearly meaning he want her to stay on.Olivia Wilde (\"Thirteen\") has re-joined the team, with House telling everyone she was in rehab. The first case is a 16-year old named Kendall Pearson who was trying to be the youngest person to sail around the world. During training she collapsed and her sponsors want to make sure she's healthy enough for the trip. To break the record she must leave in three days. From a video camera atop the mast of her ship, they see Kendall hit her back and start running appropriate tests. House makes reference to the internship and Masters.Masters takes a liking to Kendall who, like her, is a prodigy in her given field.Masters gets paged for the LP she needs and on the way asks Cuddy for advice about working with House. Cuddy doesn't say much to help her decide.Cruz has once again stolen her LP. But after spotting a chicken on House's desk, Masters finds that House has just finished an LP and forged her name on the record. She says she plans to accept the internship and he says she can have it if she submits her LP log without actually having completed the tenth one herself.Kendall's hands turn blue during a treadmill test. The next idea is that Kendall had a cerebral vasospasm and more tests are ordered. House is planting fake chicken prints heading from Wilson's office as part of some silly contest the two doctors are having.Masters tries to turn in the false test log but chickens out.Thirteen tells Masters that House and Wilson have a bet to see who can keep a chicken the longest without being caught by security. House has apparently gotten ahold of the calmest, least noisy breed of chicken.Thirteen allows Masters to perform an LP on her to complete her requirement. Thirteen doesn't think there's room on House's team for someone who does things differently -- like \"playing by the rules.\"The thinking is that Kendall's case has been figured out. Her pineal gland was calcified and hormone replacements are ordered. House figures out that Masters gave Thirteen the LP and rescinds his offer for her to join the team: \"Enjoy surgery, you'll do fine.\"Masters wakes up the next morning, this time rattling off info related to her new internship in surgery. She impresses the chief during the first surgery she observes (by breaking a rule that interns observe and not comment) and he asks her to scrub in on his next procedure. Masters is surprised to learn Kendall is being prepped for surgery and she runs over to learns from Mr. Pearson that Kendall is having a sympathectomy. The procedure shouldn't impact the record.During the surgery Masters has scrubbed in on she hears that Kendall's surgery is going poorly. To the horror of her chief Masters says she has to go to the bathroom and heads over to Kendall's surgery. House seems pleased to learn Masters lied to be there. The diagnosis for Kendall is Wegener's and steroids are ordered. Masters thinks it might be something else and House says if she wants to work on the case she should fill out a consult form. Masters claims she's only going to stay for this one case.Masters pulls an all-nighter working on Kendall's case. She ends up sleeping in the office and sees Wilson try to steal a fake chicken House has planted in his office to trap him. This gives Masters an idea.Masters thinks Kendall has a bone-based form of salmonella. During the exam Kendall talks about the fact that doing what you love often comes at a price. Masters seems to find what she's looking for in her left arm.Masters and Chase conduct the MRI. He tells her that she should stick with surgery, since House can change you for the worse. During the MRI they see what looks to be cancer in Kendall's arm.Masters tells the family that she has cancer. It is treatable with amputation of her arm. Kendall doesn't want to end her career, regardless of the fact sailing could increase the chance of it spreading. Masters is stunned when the parents seem to be considering letting her race.Mr. Pearson tells Masters that his wife has decided to let Kendall race. Even though he doesn't love the idea, he's worried going against his daughter will destroy their family. She petitioned to be an emancipated minor in the past and he thinks she'll do it again.Masters talks to House (who is training a dog to snatch Wilson's chicken) about her dilemma. When she says she's unwilling to lie to get Kendall life-saving surgery House he was wrong about her: \"You're not exceptional.\"Wilson tells her a story about a former girlfriend of House's signing a petition to get him life-saving surgery he didn't want. Afterwards a security guard spots House's chicken.Masters asks Kendall one more time to have the surgery before leaving. In saying no, she tells Masters that \"at the top of the game, you play by different rules.\" Masters ends up giving Kendall an IV that puts her into cardiac arrest. As she crashes Masters rushes to her parents, tells them this is what would have happened at sea and gives them the consent forms. Masters rushes to the OR and tells them how to quickly stabilize Kendall and hands over the forms.Kendall wakes up without an arm. Despite the fact they found cancer in her lymph nodes (it was spreading) she yells that she hates her parents. Masters listens to all of this.The next day Masters goes to House and tells him she not going to join his team. She not sure at this point what she's going to do, but as she exits the hospital, she is smiling and holds her head high.", "episode_4": "A young woman is home alone.

Not surprisingly House doesn't give her a warm reception. A few ideas are tossed around about our vomiting 30-year old, one of which is lead poisoning.House tells Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) he and Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) aren't spending the night together at her place and he isn't spending any time with Cuddy's daughter yet.While working on Margaret (Erin Cahill), the vomiting woman , Chase assures Kelly not to worry about the cool reception she got from House and Foreman (Omar Epps). They notice multiple broken ribs, something she never told the doctors about.At Margaret's house, Foreman denies having lasting feeling for the departed Thirteen (Olivia Wilde). They find a credit card receipt from a lunch Margaret never mentioned.Margaret tells the docs the lunch was an honest mistake and the fractures are a decade old.House is less than romantic the next time Cuddy leaves his place. As she leaves, an attractive blonde masseuse is arriving.Doing research into her past histories, Kelly finds Margaret is using the social security number of a woman born in the 1940s. Cut to Margaret seizing with a heart attack and being worked on by the whole team.Margaret wakes up to House asking who she is. She tells her current husband that five years she was married to an abusive man. She left him, but he found her, stalked her and poisoned her dog. She took a dead woman's identity to escape the man (named Carl). She tells them her real name is Jenny.House grills Kelly for answers about Jenny's dueling stomach/heart issues. She doesn't come up with anything. House suggests perhaps the ex used the poison he killed the dog with on Jenny.Foreman isn't convinced Kelly is talented enough to work with them. He thinks Chase wants to sleep with her.Jenny's husband is upset she never told him about the abusive ex. He leaves her room.Cuddy asks about the masseuse.

Cuddy says she won't see him any more unless he stops seeing the hooker/masseuse.Chase learns from Kelly she was not, in fact, the lead editor for the paper at her medical school. She asks if he's regretting hiring her but he says no. Chase gets a page. Jenny's current husband was just admitted to the ER.House tells Wilson the hooker/masseuse issue will set a principle for the entire relationship. Wilson thinks he needs to make this sacrifice to save the relationship.Jenny's husband (whose face has been beaten thoroughly) tells the docs he found a guy named Carl in Jenny's address book and went to see him. When Carl denied everything, the husband got upset and then got his butt whooped. Carl is not pressing charges, but Kelly thinks the husband should. Carl said he was just a guy Jenny used to work with.Jenny's temperature begins to spike.House shows a picture of Chase's mother on a projector and suggests the similarity in appearance to Kelly is why he hired her. Kelly mentions Legionnaires' Disease. House decides they should look into it. Foreman figures out Chase actually came up with the Legionnaires' Disease idea during prep.In the hallway, Chase wants to know why Foreman is so fired-up about Kelly being unqualified. He guesses Foreman is picking on her because he's scared to take on House.House hires an attractive man to give Cuddy a massage. She tries to get out of it but ends up getting the massage. During the massage, she figures out he is a male prostitute.Kelly is stressed-out and tells Chase she's considering quitting. Chase counters she should lean on her background in psychiatry.The husband tells Kelly he found out the abuse counseling center in Trenton Jenny had gone to is nonexistent. He's worried she could be lying about any number of things, but Kelly tells him to relax for the time being.House tells Cuddy he isn't bothered by a male hooker giving her a massage and she should treat him the same way. She points out the difference in the situation and wonders whether this is House's way of sabotaging the relationship. House responds - she should invite him over and introduce him to her daughter. She says she wants to protect her daughter and this makes House think she's holding back.When Jenny wakes up, he calmly asks her about the lies. During this conversation she begins to hallucinate, seeing flames and snakes all over the room.We see House waking up alone.The docs assume whatever is happening has hit Jenny's brain. Kelly is the only one to suggest these latest symptoms could be unrelated, simply the first sings of mental illness. House orders a biopsy.During surgery, Jenny's temperature breaks. House talks with Kelly, Taub (Peter Jacobson) and Chase and we realize her temperature could have been gone since the day before and she hasn't thrown up since being admitted. House goes to the OR and turns off Kelly's pacemaker. Nothing happens. All that's left are the delusions. Kelly wonders if maybe they were prompted by the physical symptoms. House thinks it was just the opposite and orders several treatments.House talks to the still-hallucinating Jenny. He walks through all of her lies (former husband, treatments, etc.) and has her admit to her husband that she has schizophrenia. On his way out of the room, House makes a crack about Kelly not being able to figure this out from the beginning.Jenny's husband goes to House and tells him he thinks it may be too hard to live with her now. \"It's always hard,\" House says.In the elevator, Chase tells House he should probably get rid of Kelly. House disagrees, since she was the only one to get him to the right answer.House agrees he will stop seeing his hooker/masseuse. She invites him over.Chase finds Kelly packing up her stuff to quit.

The wounded soldier on the ground is House - at which point he awakens from the odd dream. Cuddy gives him a file for a \"boring\" case of someone who is related to a hospital donor - but House is immediately gripped because the file picture is the soldier who gave him the weapon in his dream.The team is surprised that House has taken a case of vague Gulf War symptoms - joint pain, fatigue, etc., which they say can be found statistically in any large group of people. Wilson is intrigued by House's dream. House, meanwhile, is secretly striving to figure out where he's seen the guy before, so he orders the team to get a lengthy history, including television appearances.During the team's interview, the patient, John Kelley, realizes that they do not believe his symptoms. He states that he doesn't care what they call it, Gulf War Syndrome or whatever, he just wants them to find out what it is so they can cure it.Sleep apnea could cause fatigue, so a sleep observation test is ordered. Since it is proving uneventful, Cameron coaxes Chase into occupying another bedroom with her. When Foreman arrives in the observation room, Kelley is shouting for help. He smells something horrible, and Foreman sees that he has a nasty infection in his mouth. Disheveled, Cameron and Chase arrive on the scene. Later, Foreman asks where they were, and refutes a claim they went out for coffee by noting they didn't have any when they came in. Cameron coolly confesses that they were having sex, causing Foreman to laugh at the ludicrousness of the idea.Suspecting cancer, Wilson biopsies Kelley's salivary glands, but the results show nothing. House asks Wilson for a prescription because he hasn't urinated in 3 days. Wilson blames the Vicodin, which House has no intention of stopping.Chase tells Cameron that he doesn't want to lose his job over their sexual relationship, and will not do it at work anymore. Cameron says fine. Then flirtatiously asks him if he wants to go to lunch.During additional tests by Wilson, Kelley unexpectedly loses his hearing. The results show cancerous growths in Kelley's brain. Cameron and Chase, returning from their \"lunch\", advise House that they have taken a history back to Kelley's great grandfather, including his uncle's nosebleeds. Wilson freaks that House has them researching his dream, and drags the team away.Later, ready to drill into Kelley's skull for major work on his brain, Foreman notices that the O.R. brain scans are clear - the growths are no longer present. Cuddy produces scans from the VA, showing that the growths were not present before. Still immobilized for the procedure, Kelley begins shouting that he has lost feeling in his legs. Appearing concerned, House bends over him, and shouts, \"Have you ever been in a porno?!\"House orders the team to observe the patient for changes, and astonishes them by going home to sleep. Anxious for some bladder relief, he painfully catheterises himself and crawls into bed.Back and the hospital the team is still concerned about exposure to depleted uranium in the war zone. Despite House's orders against it, they decide to treat him for that. The numbness starts creeping up Kelley's body, and when it reaches his diaphragm he will need to be put on a respirator.House spends sleepless hours in bed, then returns to work. He is furious that the team introduced a new treatment, since now they will not know if that is affecting Kelley's symptoms.Kelley is now pale and losing blood, probably internally since there is none externally. At the patient's bedside, as House goes for equipment to start a transfusion, yellow fluid appears on the floor. Chase bends down and discovers it is urine. He looks at House and sees a bag attached to his leg, gushing fluid, and everyone is astonished. House defiantly asks if they've never seen a urine catch bag before.Suddenly House's nose starts to bleed. He puts his hand up to it, thoughtfully looks at it - and wakes up in his own bed, covered by a wet sheet. The catheter is on the floor, and he has slept quite a few hours.He returns to the hospital and looks in Kelley's nose. It is dry and hairless. He points out to the team that Kelley's nose must have been cauterized when he was a kid, probably to prevent the nosebleeds that his uncle also suffered. This is a manifestation of an inherited illness, Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome (hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia), which also explains each of Kelley's other problems. House explains how each area can be treated and cleared up to relieve Kelley's symptoms.Confronting Cuddy, House has finally realized where he saw Kelley before. A hospital benefit years ago, with his tongue down Cuddy's throat! Cuddy admits she didn't want to tell him because of the things he would say. But she also says it bothered House because he was jealous, and smugly tells House to get over her.Cameron and Chase are in the janitor's closet, celebrating.

She is also unable to sweat and regulate her body temperature. As the episode begins, Hannah's mother is rushing her to the hospital emergency room on a snowy night. Hannah had been playing on the ice with some friends and slipped and fell. Her mother is concerned that Hannah may have injured herself, so she wants her to get checked out at the hospital. Unfortunately, they are involved in a serious car accident. Hannah takes a nasty laceration to the leg while her mother is knocked unconscious.The ER is overcrowded, so Foreman is filling in and treating Hannah, who has purposefully neglected to tell Foreman about her CIPA. A nurse who has been dating Foreman asks if he'll be off work for Valentine's Day. House strolls into the ER and immediately diagnoses Hannah when she mimics flinching to a painful stimulus, but does it wrong. He decides to admit her and run x-rays, blood tests, and an EEG. He also wants to perform a spinal nerve biopsy, but Cuddy tells him there is no need for a nerve biopsy unless the EEG is abnormal. House observes from various clues that Cuddy has a blind date.Hannah is a very reluctant patient. She is worried about her mother and won't sit still for the test. House asks Foreman to sedate her, and Foreman tells him that they tried but she fought back and they were afraid of pushing any harder for fear of breaking one of her bones. House decides to take matters into his own hands. He and Hannah have a whine-off over whose life is more pitiful (which shows what Hannah's daily life is like, since she has to check her body frequently for problems). When Hannah turns around to show House scars on her buttocks, he injects her with the sedative. He tells them to give her nitrous oxide if she wakes up. They run the EEG, but in the end, all the tests are normal.When Cameron goes to tell Hannah the results, she finds her unresponsive with a temperature of 105\u00b0F (40.6\u00b0C). Her temperature is brought back to normal, but there is no clear cause of her fever. A lumbar puncture (spinal tap) was negative, suggesting no meningitis. While there is an elevated bilirubin, the rest of her liver tests are normal. Her urine drug screen is negative. House interrupts Cuddy's blind date at a nearby cafe to talk her into letting him perform the spinal nerve biopsy.Meanwhile, the Young Guns decide that a spinal nerve biopsy is too risky, and they want to find a better way to diagnose Hannah. Chase suggests that if the pain levels are high enough, Hannah may be able to feel some pain after all and pinpoint where the problem is. He recommends that they purposefully overload her pain sensors and monitor what happens. Chase has Hannah alternate her hand between warm water and boiling water while he runs a brain scan. Unfortunately, she is so worried about her mother that she leaves her hand too long in the boiling water and gives herself second degree burns.Foreman tries the next test. He has some bizarre set-up where he is drilling into the skull and injecting some medication into her brain to stimulate pain receptors. It seems to be working as Hannah starts screaming in pain. However, as soon as they unhook her from the machine, she bolts for the door. She was just faking the pain in order to escape because she has developed a full blown paranoia and thinks everyone is out to get her. Hannah runs to the lobby balcony and threatens to jump off. The team tries to talk her down, but her legs suddenly become numb and lose control and she falls to the lobby below. She now has several broken bones and a concussion in addition to whatever is causing her fever and leg numbness.House suspects some form of nerve disease. HIV and syphilis are suggested, but he points out that all STD tests were negative. He also states that the cause can't be vascular because her ANA (Anti-Nuclear Antibody) is normal. Cameron suggests thyroid storm (a rare life-threatening condition where the thyroid gland goes into massive overdrive) as the cause.He goes to Cuddy's house in person, again interrupting her date, to consult with her as an endocrinologist, even though there is one on call. She shoots down that idea, and shoots House down for jealously showing up at her house, too. Sadly, her date still ends up leaving.House wants to proceed with the spinal nerve biopsy. Wilson talks to him in private, accusing House of wanting what's best for himself, and not what's best for the patient. House relents and grudgingly allows the Young Guns to perform a much less risky peripheral nerve biopsy. While in the lab, Cameron and Foreman discuss relationships. Foreman points out that although Cameron was married, she knew the guy was dying, so it wasn't going to be a lifelong committment.The test results show a demyelinating disease that is affecting outside fibers first. (If you think of a nerve as a wire, then myelin is the insulation surrounding the wire. Demyelinating diseases strip this insulation.) House now suspects some sort of metabolic disease. Cameron takes Hannah to see her mother, who is between surgeries.Hearing that Hannah had a headache after visiting her mother in the ICU, he decides that it was an emotional a guilty headache and this guilt means that she has a vitamin B12 deficiency. Foreman points out that she received B12 in the ER. House is now concerned about leukemia and the team is ready to start a bone marrow biopsy. Talking to Wilson (and eating his food), House has a sudden realization and runs to stop the biopsy. He grabs the nitrous oxide mask, saying it is what revealed the problem in the first place.He rushes her to the OR and personally opens up her abdomen and stomach and pulls out a tapeworm yards long. This tapeworm led Hannah to become B12 deficient which led to her loss of sensation in her legs. With some B12 replacement, Hannah should be good to go (of course, she'll still have CIPA).In the locker room, Foreman gives his nurse girlfriend news: he's gotten her accepted into a program to train as a nurse practitioner. She is aghast that he'd go that far to break up with her.As Chase and Cameron leave the hospital, she proposes that they start seeing each other purely for convenient sex, with no emotional ties.", "episode_17": "A noted photographer arrives late to a session, claiming morning sickness. She promises that this shoot will get her subject 40 years of fans. While taking pictures, she suddenly complains that the backdrop letters are jumbled. Since they are obviously not, everyone looks at her concerned. She starts trying to think of a mnemonic - F, Face - she smiles crookedly and asks if her face is straight. Clearly, it isn't. A, Arms - she holds out her arms and cannot keep them stable. She repeats the mnemonic, FAST. S, Speech - she knows she is slurring her words. T, Time - time is critical. The FAST mnemonic identifies the symptoms of a stroke. As she collapses she tells them to call an ambulance.In the hospital, House comes to see her, explaining that Cuddy says she is important. He asks how she knew about the stroke mnemonic, and she explains the baby's sperm donor is a neurologist, a gay friend. He banters with her about photography, then has her extend her arms with her eyes closed. He observes pronator drift, which means a stroke does NOT completely explain her symptoms. After naming her doctor an idiot, he decides to keep her in the hospital and run more tests.Throughout the episode, she takes world-class photos, revealing the subject's inner self. Cameron wonderingly examines the first one, of House, where he looks like he's \"caring\".The tests show that Emma's kidney's are failing. House observes that Emma has had five cases of strep throat, which means she probably never finished her antibiotics. This leads to rheumatic fever, which may have damaged her heart, causing the clot which caused the stroke.During all this, House makes various inquiries into random vacation destinations, such as the Galapagos Islands and Cambodia.While watching Emma's heart MRI, Chase and Cameron discuss being caught making out in the janitor's closet last week by House. The MRI shows a minor problem with Emma's heart. They do a procedure on it, observed by Cuddy, but Emma's kidney's continue to fail.House concludes that there is something wrong with the fetus which is harming Emma's body. This is called Mirror Syndrome. House decides to paralyze the fetus's heart, and Cuddy reassures Emma that this won't harm the baby. House pointedly refers to it as a \"fetus\", not a \"baby\".The tests show that the fetal bladder is so distended that it's crowding its' other organs. This can be fixed with a shunt. Cuddy also lectures Cameron on relationships in the workplace.The shunt is inserted, but Emma develops liver problems. House decides the fetus is \"lying\" and there is something else wrong. He tells Emma they are going to have to deliver the fetus, but it will not live because it needs two more weeks in utero to be viable. She wants to wait the two weeks. The problem is, there is dialysis for kidneys, but no such thing for her liver. She has two days, not two weeks. She refuses to consider terminating the baby. House explains that it's not a matter of her dying so the fetus can live, they will BOTH die. She doesn't care.Cuddy supports Emma's decision at the next team meeting, looking for alternatives. They decide on a liver biopsy, and Cuddy sends House home to go on his vacation. During the biopsy, Foreman discusses Chase's relationship with Cameron, which House has revealed. Emma suddenly goes into labor, which they successfully stop. The team believes it's time to terminate the fetus, but Cuddy will not listen to reason. She goes to give the baby steroids, which will help its lungs to develop and give it a chance to survive when delivered.Unfortunately, this gives Emma a pulmonary edema. Cuddy manages to save her life, but Emma ends up on a respirator. Cuddy admits to Wilson that she was wrong ... but then realizes that with Emma already on a respirator, she can now do what she likes with the lungs, and rushes off to give more steroids. Cuddy takes views of the lungs to House's place and explains that now she realizes how hard it must be for him, when he knows he's right and nobody will listen. He returns to the hospital with her.They decide to do exploratory surgery on the baby, keeping the umbilical connected to the mother to keep it alive, with the hope of solving the problem and putting the baby back inside the mother.As House opens the uterus, the baby's hand sticks out and grasps House's finger. He is paralyzed with wonder for a moment, but Cuddy snaps him back to reality and he makes a joke about Tivo'ing Alien. They find lesions on the baby's lungs and prepare to fix them, but Emma's heart starts to go. Cuddy shocks her twice, but it does not resolve. House grabs the scissors and is prepared to cut the umbilical cord to save Emma's life, but Cuddy tells him to back off or she'll electrocute him. He does, and a third shock brings Emma's heart back to normal. The surgery continues successfully.House visits Emma later in her hospital room, and she notes that he refers to her fetus as a \"baby\" for the first time.Cameron finds a picture Emma took of Chase, with a radiant glow. She asks why, and he does not admit he was admiring a photo of Cameron at the time.House chews out Cuddy for the chance she took, saying the success was small odds and she should have just saved the mother. Cuddy is too happy to care, and gives him tickets to Vancouver Island for his vacation. House goes home, tears up the tickets, drags his leg onto the sofa and watches television instead.Months later, Emma hangs framed pictures of the team on her wall, including Cuddy accompanying her into the delivery room, then walks to a bassinet and picks up her baby.", "episode_3": "The ketamine has worn off and House is back to using his cane and doesn't want to talk about it.

Becoming increasingly debilitated, Ezra ultimately demands that the team stop the litany of medical tests and help him end his life. The team members have divergent opinions on the morality of helping Ezra die, especially since the possibility of a cure is still in question.

House is worried people will think he's a patient because of his limp. When Wilson suggests he wear a lab coat, House tells him he's afraid people will think he is a doctor. House thinks that the patient has a brain tumor, but Wilson asks him to take the case because she's his cousin. Wilson doesn't think its cancer because she isn't improving with radiation therapy. Wilson reminds him that House has three overqualified doctors working for him that would love to work on the case.\nHouse meets with his team and reminds them that \"everybody lies\". New hire Foreman is wondering why House isn't with the patient, but Cameron tells him that House doesn't like meeting patients. At this point, House has stopped thinking it's a tumor.

Wilson bluffs, but then gets the patient's name wrong. House calls Foreman an idiot - House has realized that has a tapeworm from eating pork, something that would never have occured to him if he still believed the patient was Jewish. That would explain why she reacted well to the steroids initially, but then got worse. Tapeworms usually stay in the digestive system, but the eggs can pass into the bloodstream and into the brain. However, the steroids started to kill the worm and now it's death is stirring up the patient's immune system. There is no way to test for it except by trying to treat it. However, the patient is tired of being treated and wants to go home and die.\nHouse goes to see the patient and calls her an idiot for refusing treatment. She reminds him that his previous diagnosis was wrong. She asks why he's crippled and he explains that he had an infarction in his thigh and they didn't figure out what was wrong until it was too late to treat it. She thinks he avoids patients because he doesn't want people to see him crippled. He tells her there is no way to die with dignity - everyone dies and it's always ugly.

But then he turns around and she's there.", "episode_5": "We opened on Thirteen (Olivia Wilde) having a hot make out session with another girl. Spencer (Angela Gots) in her apartment -- and it isn't even sweeps week!Soon enough, the nameless girl had a seizure after they'd had sex, which was undoubtedly going to leave Thirteen with some explaining to do once House (Hugh Laurie) got hold of this story. Thirteen, it turned out, didn't know the girl's name and the patient had mixed ecstasy with alcohol. House and Foreman (Omar Epps) asked Thirteen if she'd also been doing drug and she said, \"Not diagnostically relevant.\" Thirteen, Kutner (Kal Penn) and Taub (Peter Jacobson) all thought the problem was easily explained by blood clots, but House wanted more tests.House sat in as Thirteen injected her friend with a massive needle to get some bone marrow. He asked several probing questions about the patient's evening with Thirteen that made Thirteen uncomfortable.House had his private investigator -- remember that guy? (Michael Weston) -- look into where Wilson was earlier that morning because he was afraid Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) was lying to him about where he'd been. Wilson's back at the hospital, by the way.Thirteen, also known as Dr. Hadley, discovered her patient/lover had used her to get House to figure out her undiscovered illness. Thirteen wondered if the woman had faked the seizure, but she said she wouldn't have faked a symptom because that would have only made it harder for House to do his job. Thirteen still didn't believe there was anything seriously wrong with the woman and wanted to discharge. Thirteen said House was using the patient to get information on her personal life. Then the patient crashed.House rubbed Thirteen's nose in the fact she was wrong about the patient, then he suggested she was just jealous of him because the whole time the patient was with her, she was really thinking about his \"huge, throbbing ... diagnostic skills.\"House figured out the patient was a serious drug user, which upset Thirteen. She was mad because she knew that meant the woman's seizure was set off by something she'd done at Thirteen's house, which meant House was going to go through her house. Thirteen refused to give him her keys, though, so he had Foreman come along to pick the lock. But he couldn't, which prompted House to tell him, \"You're a disgrace to your stereotype.\" House opened the door with a key he'd had his private investigator make.House found a brown recluse spider in Thirteen's apartment, which could have caused the seizure and heart problems if the patient had been bitten. He had Thirteen examine her for a spider bite. Thirteen told the woman she didn't intend to see her again, but the woman suggested they had potential for a relationship. Then Thirteen realized the woman's hip was numb, which meant it wasn't a spider bite.House staked out Wilson's place with the private investigator and saw that Wilson appeared to have hired a prostitute.Foreman, who knew Thirteen was afraid of what House might have found at her place, told Thirteen he'd found it. It was the result of a recent test showing her Huntington's Disease was more advanced than she'd thought, which meant she had less time. Foreman told her to do things to make her better, but Thirteen decided doing drugs and having sex with strangers was her way of having fun, \"cramming as much life into my life as I can.\"After the patient stopped breathing during surgery, House and the crew went over more possibilities, but Thirteen was missing. We saw her in an exam room, having hooked herself up to an IV. She answered a knock on the door by saying there was an exam going on, but the door opened anyway. It was Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein), and she didn't look happy.Cuddy told House about Thirteen hooking herself up to an IV for fluids and Cuddy wanted Thirteen to take a drug test. House defended Thirteen and said she didn't have to take the drug test. Then he fired her. She was shocked, but he told her he just wanted to save her from taking a drug test, which probably saved her career. He said he was \"already taking responsibility for one doctor with a drug habit,\" as he popped a couple of Vicodin.Wilson admitted to House he started dating a woman who \"used to be\" a prostitute. She wanted to become a lawyer and he told her he'd help her pay for law school.Thirteen was going through the patient's X-rays in hopes of coming up with something that could save her job. She realized the woman had a cyst that threatened to explode her lung if the doctors continued with a treadmill test they were doing. She raced to where Kutner and Taub were doing the test, where she found them trying to figure out why the patient couldn't breathe. She explained the patient's lung had collapsed and she jammed a syringe into the woman's chest, allowing her to breathe again.House told Thirteen \"my employees can take it from here.\" Foreman and Taub tried to talk him into giving her job back, but he'd have none of it. He asked Thirteen how much clearer he had to make himself. She walked out.House and the PI talked about the Wilson issue, and House said Wilson had a Messiah complex and wants to save women.House told Thirteen her recent exploits were about control rather than just having flings. Then he told her that the patient has Lam, a disease that gives her cysts and will continue to come back even after removal and will eventually make her lungs stop working. She had 10 years to live, and House wanted Thirteen to give her the news, even though it didn't mean she'd get her job back. She said she'd do it because she knew what it was like to get that news, and, she told him, \"no one should have to get it from you.\" She broke the news to the patient, and said, \"I'm so sorry.\"Thirteen told the patient about all the stages of grief she'd go through after getting her terminal diagnosis. They decided they'd race to the finish. Thirteen said she'd come back later, but noticed blood out of the bandages around the patient's chest, which was a new symptom that took Lam off the table. Thirteen told the doctors this, leading House to wonder if \"fired\" has a whole other definition that he's not aware of. Thirteen said he didn't have to pay her, but she wanted to finish the case. She went to help do more tests, but House told her, \"you're just a visitor.\"Foreman asked Chase (Jesse Spencer) if he thought Foreman was boring, because House had his private investigator look into Foreman and found he hadn't done anything interesting since he was 17. Chase confirmed that, indeed, Foreman is boring.House told Thirteen the patient needed a bone marrow transplant and asked Thirteen to get the woman's consent.The private investigator handed House a bag of Wilson's trash, which included some used syringes. \"He's using,\" the PI said. House smiled, walked into Wilson's office and praised him for his craftiness. The syringes, the prostitute, all of it was made up because Wilson knew House was having him followed. House still wanted to know where Wilson was that morning, and Wilson, knowing House would just keep having him followed, told House to be outside his house at 8 o'clock that night.Thirteen told House the patient said yes to the transplant. House told Thirteen she was in a downward spiral and that she was going to push people away until she died. But until then, he could use her because she did good work. She realized he was trying to save her, making her spend time with the woman to forge a connection.House noticed Thirteen's lips were cracked and deduced the patient was suffering from Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, an auto-immune disease which caused her tears and saliva production to dry up and made her mouth vulnerable to a yeast infection, which she had passed to Thirteen. Sj\u00f6gren's explained the patient's other symptoms, including the lung cysts, and Thirteen's dry lips. It also meant the patient was no longer going to die, and House prescribed treatment for the disease. Thirteen later admitted to Foreman that now she suddenly felt alone.House followed Wilson that night -- to a baby store where Cuddy was shopping for a crib. She told him she was adopting a baby and had used Wilson as a character reference, and that's where Wilson was that morning. House looked stunned by the news and when Cuddy asked if he was going to congratulate her, he said, \"If you're happy, I'm...\" Then he walked out.Back at her house, Thirteen was hooking up with another strange girl (Helena Barrett).", "episode_21": "An environmental group protests. Some are chained to a bulldozer. They shout back and forth with the miners whose work they're stopping.\nA woman chained to the bulldozer slumps over. A police officer says she has no pulse and the protest is over. But she wakes up, just dehydrated. The man chained next to her frees himself but then finds his vision is blurry and he can't stand. He falls.Cameron (Jennifer Morrison) tells Chase (Jesse Spencer) she wants to push back their planned weeklong getaway. She wants to get House (Hugh Laurie) to take a case and keep it, a favor for another doctor.She presents the case of environmentalist Doug to the team. They think it's something from exposure to toxic chemicals. House tells her to do the test.She explains to the patient she'll be injecting ice water into his ear canal (just try to read that and not get the shivers) to see if the balance problem is his inner ear. As she does it, he gripes about the free flowers in his room and their pesticides. He pukes on her.House stalks Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) in the cafeteria. Wilson's eating an egg white omelette, which House finds odd. Wilson thinks House is just avoiding talking about Kutner. House is wearing the watch Kutner gave him for secret Santa.The team thinks it's odd House is making Cameron do the test. She reports on the puking. They still think he's faking, but House buys it because the patient puked on her, not away from her.He orders her to do another test. He's been hiccuping a few hours a day for a week. The other doctors didn't think it was anything.Chase asks Cameron if she's avoiding him by putting off their trip. She says there's a reason she needs to stay with the case, but she can't tell him what it is. He says OK.House thinks it's weird she's doing the tests he's ordering her to do, because usually she'd point out he's not her boss. He tries to suss out her motives.She presents the hiccups and no balance to the team. Taub (Peter Jacobson) tosses out MS and House tells Cameron to do a lumbar puncture - which is tough given the hiccups.Foreman (Omar Epps) helps by holding the patient down. He takes the opportunity to ask Cameron about her motives.Chase asks Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) if Cameron has asked for her spot back on the team. She says no. Then he asks if she thinks Cameron is in love with House. When Cuddy says that's a ridiculous question, he asks if she is.\nThat's an even more ridiculous question. He decides to extrapolate from her lack of answers.House roots through the lounge fridge. A woman comes in saying she's Doug's wife. He told her he was in jail so she wouldn't worry, but she went through his email and found the referral to House. She had to get someone to take care of their four year old son. House is disgusted by the bite of Wilson's kale he just ate.House drops in on Cameron and Foreman mid-lumbar, saying he's figured it out. He thinks Wilson put her up to it, but she points out that makes no sense since he's a better liar than she is and wouldn't have to cancel a vacation.\nThey notice lumps on Doug's neck. House pokes one. It's crunchy.That rules out MS.The team spitballs, mostly involving exposure to chemicals at the various plants he protested. House sends the team to run the next test. He wants to see where Cameron will go if she can't be there.Cuddy tells Cameron that Chase is concerned. Then Cuddy asks if Cameron is in love with House. She thinks Cuddy is marking her territory. Cuddy says neither of them should love House.Doug's wife begs him to quit protesting. He says he's doing it for their son.There's a knock at Wilson's door at 10:30 pm. Of course it's House.\nHe thinks Wilson is eating healthy because of Kutner, a wake-up call to eat healthier.\nWilson pulls out some ice cream and bacon from his fridge.House answers his phone to screams of extreme pain from the patient. House thinks it's an infection made worse by the steroids they just gave him.\nThey run a test to check his bones. They're normal.Thirteen (Olivia Wilde) asks Taub if he and his wife talk about stuff. Taub guesses Foreman's not chatty. On the x-ray he notices Doug's femur - the strongest bone in the body - is broken. He broke it lying in bed.House thinks the carcinogens Doug was exposed to mean he has cancer. He wants to start him on chemo.\nForeman interrupts Chase fixing the guy's leg in surgery. He wants bone for a biopsy to make sure the cancer diagnosis is right. Chase asks what Cameron thinks and Foreman tells him she isn't on the case anymore. News to him.House visits Cameron in the ER, asking why she's still around on her week off. Then he decides she and Chase are over. She says he's wrong. She pauses, then tells House that she is going to ask her to marry him. She found the ring looking for socks. She doesn't want him to ask. She thinks it's a reaction to Kutner. She doesn't want him to propose just because he's scared.House sees a couple in the clinic. Cuddy interrupts, asking what's going on with Cameron. He says she doesn't want back on his team and she doesn't want to jump him.\nWhen Cuddy is ready to take that as an answer, he realizes she only cared about the answer to one of those questions.Foreman visits Doug, telling him he doesn't have cancer. But - his leg wound starts oozing blood and Foreman realizes he's bleeding out.House is back to thinking it's cancer, but they can't find it. House wants to do total body irradiation. Taub thinks that's insane. He suggests giving him something to make his tumor bigger so they can find it. House goes for it.House walks in on Wilson eating carrots. He thinks he's lost his mojo. He was clueless about Kutner, he was wrong about Cameron and he thinks he should have come up with Taub's suggestion. And he can't figure out why Wilson is eating healthy.\nHe thinks he's losing his mind.\nWilson, unconcerned, thinks this makes perfect sense because he can't find reason in the irrational thing Kutner did.Doug's wife isn't thrilled with the tumor-enhancement plan. And then his heart stops beating.Chase finds Cameron. He wants to know what's going on. She says she needs a little more time. He says no. She says it has nothing to do with House.\n\"Well it has nothing to do with me anymore, either,\" he says. \"Let me know when I can come pick up my things.\"House is frustrated because they haven't grown a tumor and he can't figure out what's wrong. He asks the team to start diagnosing all over again. They've got nothing.\nHouse says they should put in a defibrilator so he won't die while they're still diagnosing.House runs things by Wilson at the vending machine.\nThere's nothing healthy in it. Wilson gets gummy bears, which he hates. More importantly, so does House.\nHe realizes Wilson has been eating healthy because he doesn't. Not because Wilson has finally grown tired after a decade of House mooching food, but because he's screwing with him.\nWilson cops to it. A little game to try to let things feel back to normal after Amber died. And half the fun was letting House figure out he was doing it.\nMisson accomplished.\nThen House has another epiphany.House visits the patient as Taub runs down the defibrilator plan.\nHe has a few questions. But no, they don't have a garden, or window box.\nThen he decides their marriage is in trouble and Doug tried to fix it by compromising his flower principles.Yep, he missed their anniversary dinner for a rally and he bought her roses, but she was gone and he threw them out. House says it's an infection from the rose's thorns. He got lesions on his nerves which caused the various early symptoms and the steriods made it worse.\nHe'll be fine, but it's bad news for his wife: he'll never doubt himself again.House drops in on Cameron in the clinic, telling her her favor is repaid. He thinks Kutner's death made her freak out about things with Chase, given she lost her first husband. He tells her not to dump Chase by dumping cases on him. When she says she wasn't trying to dump him, House says she was trying to get him to dump her. Much less guilt.Cameron tells Chase she shouldn't have postponed their vacation. He says he should never have planned it. She tells him she found the ring.\nHe says she doesn't have to worry about that anymore.\nShe says she doesn't care how it happens, she just wants it to happen. He asks if she's proposing. She's proposing he propose - after he dumped her.\nShe stands there, crying, as he takes a moment to look at her. Then he gets down on one knee and takes her hand. He doesn't say anything. She says yes. They kiss.(Scenes set to a swell bluesy piano/harmonica Hugh Laurie rendition of \"Georgia on my Mind.\")\nDoug's wife kisses him good-bye.\nWilson and House share burgers, fries and a shake - mojo restored.\nCameron and Chase break the news to Cuddy, who hugs them both.Then House, at the piano, looks up and sees Amber standing there. She says she guesses he's not crazy after all, visit from a dead girl to the contrary.", "episode_19": "We hear the beep of machines and see, from a patient's POV, blurry images of doctors and nurses.\nA voice asks what's wrong with his legs, begging for someone to talk to him.\nA doctor stands over him, saying he has a great heart for transplant.\nHe disagrees.\nNearby, House (Hugh Laurie) tells the doctor that live people don't make good donors.\nBut the doc doesn't listen; he's Mr. House today in the hospital in Middletown, N.Y. because he crashed his motorcycle. Just a scrape, nothing a boatload of Vicodin wouldn't fix.\nHouse explains why the guy isn't brain dead as the narrator, the not brain-dead guy, agrees, begging the doctor to listen to House.\nHouse peers into the camera's eye, saying he knows about locked in syndrome. He tells the man to blink if he can hear him.\nFrom our POV, a blink.\n\"Aw, this is going to be fun,\" House says.The first doctor examines him, telling him he was in an accident.\nHe flashes back to biking and not being able to stop when he sees a car door open in front of him.\nHouse thinks maybe the brain damage called the crash, not vice versa. He doesn't have any scrapes, indicating he didn't try to protect himself.His wife stands over him, Molly (Faune Chambers Watkins). She's choked up.\nIn the background, House looks at his X-rays.\nHe doesn't want to see his kids.Kutner (Kal Penn), Thirteen (Olivia Wilde) and Foreman (Omar Epps) arrive.\nHouse eats fries in front of the patient, as Thirteen comes up with the suggestion of a brain tumor.\nHouse forges a form for an MRI.\nThirteen puts video goggles on the patient as he gets the MRI. He sees House on a beach. House and the patient, Lee (Yasiin Bey), chat in beach chairs. He thinks House was sent there to make him better. His kids build sand castles nearby.He wakes up in the middle of the night, House walks in in a hospital gown and stands over him, telling him the MRI shows a lesion somewhere, which means no way head trauma did this. It's cancer.\nBut his current doctor thinks infection and has him on antibiotics that might almost kill him. But that'll work swell because then the doc will know he's wrong and listen to House.\nHouse tells Lee he's fascinating and easy to talk to.The camera starts shaking. The patient is seizing.\nNicely played, House says to Lee as he explains things to his doctor.He's transferred to Princeton-Plainsboro. Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) examines House's boo boo. \"If she turns around, she's into him,\" he thinks, watching Cuddy as he's wheeled away.\nShe glances at House.Taub (Peter Jacobson) shows up and House informs him he decided to accept his resignation after all. He thinks Taub doesn't care about impressing him, which means he won't try.Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) shows up, wanting to know why House was in Middletown. Wilson thinks House was going to get more pain pills, which sort of freaks out the patient.Kutner comes in and tells Taub he should entertain the patient. Kutner sees something on the patient and leaves. House comes in. They think he's an alcoholic or a drug user. House wants to biopsy the lesion on his brain stem.\nThe patient, in his head and on our speakers, shouts at them to stop treating him like a piece of furniture.Thirteen changes his catheter and his wife brings his kids. After a while, Thirteen suggests to his wife that they leave.\nHe was crying, she tells him.Chase (Jesse Spencer) leans in, telling him they're knocking him out for surgery, but they'll need him to answer some questions later as they cut.Back on the dreamy beach with his kids and House, asking why it's taking so long to make him better.Then back in the OR with Chase, who's holding up a shaded circle. But Lee can't blink to answer the yes or no question.He fades back out again.We return, outside Lee. He's lying frozen on the bed. They're trying to determine if he's in there or not.The team spitballs other possible causes. House is irritated they didn't ask more questions before he lost the ability to answer.\nTaub suggests there might be a better way.They strap Lee up to a computer. Taub explains the computer will learn when he thinks \"up\" and eventually the cursor on the screen will move. He tells him to start thinking \"up.\"Hours later, Taub wonders if he's still in there, or even trying.Wilson visits House, wanting to know, again, why he was in New York. Going to a prison, where Foreman's brother is being held, House says.Taub talks to Lee, saying he's sick of being scared out of his mind to go to work every day.\nTaub stands up to leave, but the computer beeps. He sits back down and the cursor on the screen moves up.His wife comes in, asking if he's really in there. The cursor moves up for yes.The team gathers around him, asking diagnostic questions with yes or no answers. His wife says he was in St. Louis and when House says it's Missouri Malaria, Lee beeps no. They're both lying. He wasn't in St. Louis.Back from Lee's POV: House narrows down where he really was. Within two miles of his house.\nWe jump outside, House and Lee standing, facing each other as he asks more questions.\nHe was staying with a friend.\nHouse calls his wife back in to name friends.\nDave's house.Kutner and Taub check out the basement of his friend's house.

Taub notes the computer was his idea.\nTaub says he realized what they do there terrifies him, but overcoming that is the only way he can matter.\nHouse says Kutner found the battery factory, maybe Taub doesn't matter.Thriteen leans in to Lee, who's been complaining about his eyes. She thinks something looks torn. She puts a drop in his eye. Whatever they see means it's not heavy metal poisoning.Cameron (Jennifer Morrison) comes to change House's dressing from the motorcycle accident as he tries to figure out what's going on with Lee.\nShe suggests he do a lumbar puncture to rule more stuff out.Wilson plops down.

Lee complains something itches.\nThen the computer cursor starts bouncing.\nThey guess the pain has moved down. They narrow it to his right foot.\nHouses guesses it itches, which means liver failure. A failure, just like Taub, House says.Dying liver would release toxins affecting the nerves which led to locked in syndrome. Now they just need to know what's causing the failure.When Foreman suggests a cause, House says it's too bad Taub didn't come up with that.Standing over Lee, Kutner asks about Thirteen's new bracelet. He noticed she was wearing it, but Foreman didn't. She likes it, which is why she left it at home -- so it wouldn't get peed on. Lee leaked on her when she was putting in the catheter. Kutner notices she now has a rash on her wrist.If there were rats in the basement, it could be an infection, which would spread to her via pee. But it'd need an entry point on him.\nThey find a wound on his finger.\nKutner tells Lee he was dying of a paper cut.Kutner tells Lee they found the infection in the rats in the basement. This means they're right. He tries to get Lee to move his finger.\nHe can't at first, but Kutner tells him not to give up.\nLee wiggles a digit.In the locker room, House asks Kutner and Taub who came up with the rat pee idea. Taub says he did as Kutner, who actually did, gives him a small approving nod.Taub leaves. House asks if Kutner is OK with Taub taking credit. House appreciates Taub cared enough to lie. That's all he needed.Wilson joins House, saying if House had actually gone to visit his girlfriend, he wouldn't have lied, he would have thrown it in his face.\nWilson borrowed House's phone and dialed the number House has been getting calls from and ignoring.\nHe's seeing a shrink.They go into Lee's room, where House has hidden a tape recorder to spy on the team.\nLee is able to move weakly and speak some. He tells House that God sent him.\n\"Suddenly, you're not so fascinating,\" House tells him.Wilson thinks it's great House is talking to someone. But House says he's not going back. It doesn't work.Switch to House's POV, Lee-style, as Wilson says: \"You'll end up alone.\"", "episode_1": "A new season of \"House\" is upon us and, for whatever reason, I'm just now noticing the \"TV-14\" rating for \"suggestive dialogue.\" That Dr. House sure does have a way with words, doesn't he?Eeeeewww! Was that a giant close-up of an ant? Cute little guy -- oh, wait. Some lady just smashed him with a newspaper. Wonder if that's going to come back? The woman, an assistance to a women's organization leader, went to a meeting and while standing in the background saw ants were crawling over her. She started screaming and tearing off her clothes, unable to get them off of her, screaming, \"HELP ME, PLEASE!!!\"Cue: awesomely cool theme song.House (Hugh Laurie) is playing video games in a coma patient's room. Wilson's back and Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) wants House to talk to him. He hasn't talked to Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) since Amber died. Foreman (Omar Epps) told House about the woman who tore off her clothes and House thought it was a psych case. Foreman listed off a bunch of fancy doctor words and said they \"aren't psychiatric symptoms. I believe him.House and the team talked through the first batch of possibilities, including international travel, long work hours, a bad diet. Thirteen (Olivia Wilde) was frustrated everyone assumed \"a strong career woman was being made sick by her strong career,\" which House jumped on. He said Thirteen was irrationally defending the patient's strong career and lack of a life outside of work because she, Thirteen, also didn't have a life and her life span had been cut in half by her positive test for Huntington's Disease. She told Kutner (Kal Penn), Taub (Peter Jacobson) and Foreman she doesn't have Huntington's, saying it's none of their business.Thirteen was running a test on the patient when the patient thought she had a bowel movement in bed (thanks, TV-14 rating!). Turns out it was blood.House went to visit Wilson and, as usual, made it all about himself first by bemoaning his feminist patient. \"I'm leaving,\" Wilson said. House mocked him and asked if he was going to take another two months. Wilson said he was resigning and was possibly moving out of New Jersey. Thirteen interrupted to tell House about their patient and House angrily told her to get out of the room. House told Wilson it was his grief talking. Wilson made it clear he wasn't changing his mind and said, \"Bye.\"Thirteen asked Taub if it bothered him House wouldn't take \"just two seconds\" to talk about their patient. She wonder if, \"that's the way it works around here? We get cut slack while we work on personal issues?\" A colonoscopy showed the patient was bleeding from ... nowhere. Kutner was giddy at discovering the patient's pregnancy test was positive and explains her symptoms. But an ultrasound showed no baby.House was only half paying attention as the team wondered about the false pregnancy test and other contradictions. He was focused on Wilson and went to confront him again, calling him an idiot. \"You're blowing up your career,\" he told him. Wilson told House it wasn't his business. Wilson wanted House to respect his decision and House said, \"I respect things that deserve respect.\" Thirteen still wanted to talk about the patient and House insisted she's pregnant.House barged into the patient's room and did the quickest ultrasound in history, finding the baby lodged in the woman's fallopian tube. It was using her intestine as a blood supply, causing the rectal bleeding, and the baby was pressing on a nerve that was slowing the woman's heartbeat. \"Yank the fetus,\" House said. \"If she survives the surgery, she'll be fine.\" He left. Thirteen chased him, asking what if the patient wants to keep the baby. She said whole fetuses have been successfully transplanted. House insisted the surgery to remove it is dangerous enough. He thought Thirteen was letting her own health scare color her every medical opinion. \"You didn't think a death sentence would...\" she said before he cut her off, saying, \"People die. You, Amber, everyone. Don't act like you just figured that out.\" He told her he gave her the diagnosis, \"you don't like it, there are exits on every floor.\"Thirteen told the patient the doctors had no choice, and she agreed easily to removing the fetus. House went to Cameron (Jennifer Morrison) to see if she'd talked to Wilson and convinced him not to leave. She said Wilson needed to handle his grief his own way, and House reminded her about what she did when her husband died: She got a new job and she moved. \"See how crappy that turned out?\" he asked.In surgery, there were complications when Chase (Jesse Spencer) was removing the fetus from her intestine. Thirteen was visibly shaken as Chase removed the fetus.House went to Cuddy to try to get her to stop Wilson from committing \"career malpractice.\" She wanted House to talk to Wilson, deal with his grief. She wanted him to tell Wilson he was sorry because she was out because of him. House listed off the reasons why he wasn't to blame. She asked if he really didn't feel any sense of guilt. He didn't respond. She told him to at least tell Wilson he feels like crap. \"It'd be meaningless,\" House said. \"Well, find some meaning and do something,\" she said. House left.Thirteen and Taub discovered the patient had a neurological problem because she wouldn't stop blinking. Foreman realized the pregnancy was just a coincidence. When the patient lost consciousness, Thirteen called for help and they all discussed how they'd paged House with no response.House's pager buzzed on Wilson's desk. House asked Wilson if it would change anything if he told him he was sorry. Wilson said he wouldn't believe him. House said he was going home until Wilson agreed to stay at the hospital. House read the text message, which said the patient was going into cardiac arrest, but he wouldn't leave until Wilson agreed to stay, telling him, \"Your friendship means more to me than this patient.\" Wilson said he's got to do what's right for him, just as House does. House left, leaving his buzzing pager on Wilson's desk. As the doctor's asked, \"Where is he?\" House was seen walking out of the hospital with his backpack on his shoulder.Cuddy went to the team and told them to do the same thing they'd do if House was there. They tried to figure it out themselves. Thirteen thought it was MS and Foreman told her to start treating her for it.Cuddy went to House's apartment and yelled at him for risking his life rather than truthfully apologizing to Wilson. She said he was afraid to make himself vulnerable in the event Wilson were to leave anyway. He closed the door in her face as she shouted, \"You're doing the same thing he is. Running away. Except he's not killing anyone in the process.\" Ouch.Cuddy coaxed both House and Wilson into her office and forced them to sit down for her version of couples counseling. As they watched video from one of the tests on the patient, Taub ripped into Thirteen for letting her Huntington's her compromise her judgment. He said she was desperate to solve the case without House because she has something to prove. Kutner noticed a possible tumor Chase might have missed during surgery. They needed to open up the patient and get a piece of it for testing.In couples counseling, House and Wilson wouldn't talk about anything real and Cuddy chimed in, laying into Wilson for walking away. She asked if Amber would have wanted him to do that. \"Nobody at this hospital even liked Amber,\" he said, before leaving.Chase refused to do a second surgery because it would require a third surgery if they found what was being looked for. Kutner suggested they \"think like House\" and get creative with a solution. They were going to push a light into her intestine and push it toward the skin so they could cut it themselves.Cameron told Wilson she thought he was making a mistake. She told him that six months after leaving he'd look back and realize he didn't know what he was doing. She said the pain \"never really goes away.\" Wilson insisted he had to do something. \"Then do it,\" Cameron said. \"But don't think it's the right choice, because there isn't one.\" Meanwhile, the team realized they couldn't figure out what was wrong with their patient without House. Thirteen suggested lymphoma.Foreman went to Wilson to see if he could come up with something, and he said it could be lymphoma. Foreman told him he should leave because no one was talking about what Wilson needed. \"If there's any chance that being away from here would make your life even a little bit easier, it's what everyone else here would do,\" Foreman told him.They started the patient on chemo for lymphoma, which she said made her feel better. Thirteen apologized for having gotten upset with the patient for letting her boss walk all over her. She then revealed to the patient she has Huntington's and explained it'll wear her down over time. She said she wanted to make sure her life mattered. Thirteen said she wanted something to be different because of her.Cuddy asked House why he thought Wilson was leaving. He again said he thought Wilson was an idiot. She decided House didn't want to know why Wilson was leaving because he was afraid to. He left.House came into the patient's room and told the doctors to stop chemo because it's not lymphoma. He said what appeared to be bruises were actually microbacterial lesions. She had a form of leprosy which could be cured with antibiotics. Thirteen confirmed for the patient House's diagnosis was right, and the patient told Thirteen she was going back to work for her boss, rather than taking a chance of doing something on her own.Thirteen told House she was frustrated the patient didn't have the guts to quit her job and do something for herself. \"She almost died\" doing that job, Thirteen said. \"Almost dying doesn't change anything,\" House said. \"Dying changes everything.\" The writers gave us a moment to bask in their cleverness before cutting to House walking into Wilson's office and sincerely apologizing.\"I know I didn't try to kill her. I know I didn't want her hurt. I know it was a freak accident. But I feel like crap and she's dead because of me,\" he told Wilson. Wilson said he didn't blame House. \"We're not OK,\" Wilson said. He said he was leaving anyway, and not because of Amber. Because of House. \"You spread misery because you can't feel anything else,\" he told House. \"We're not friends anymore, House. I'm not sure we ever were.\" After Wilson left the room, House could be seen standing there in stunned silence.", "episode_9": "We opened on some slow-motion shots of folks standing around the hospital until the action moved to regular speed. Foreman (Omar Epps) told Thirteen (Olivia Wilde) he was working on some clinical trials testing drugs -- one was for Huntington's. Thirteen said she wasn't interested and wasn't getting treatment or following any kind of program. \"Nor am I looking for a consult,\" she said.An older man looked a bit distressed as he sat outside Cuddy's office, where he saw House (Hugh Laurie) sitting behind the desk, messing around with the drawers -- remember that later. He went in and asked House about when Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) would be back and House told him to \"get out and leave me alone.\" The man apologized, then stepped out of Cuddy's office, pulled out a gun and brought hostages, including Thirteen and a bunch of patients who were in the waiting room, into Cuddy's office, where House was still sitting. The man said he was sick and wanted to know why. He wanted the best doctor there immediately, or he would start killing people. \"What seems to be the problem?\" House asked.Cue totally awesome music and credits!The man said he'd been to 16 doctors in three years and undergone all kinds of tests. He said he couldn't breathe. He was tired all the time, got rashes, heart palpitations and insomnia. House was being his usual, contradictory self, telling the man his symptoms could be coming from something simpler than the years in prison he could serve for taking hostages. \"Shut up and do your job,\" the man told House, shoving his medical records into House's chest.House did a quick test to see if the man could blow out a lighter at arm's length. He couldn't, which gave House the conclusion the man had pulmonary scleroderma. Cuddy called the office phone, which House answered. He asked for some propophal to prove his diagnosis was right. The man didn't want a cop to bring in the drugs, so he demanded Cuddy do it. \"She might be armed,\" House said. \"I'd have asked her to bring it in shirtless.\"The man held a woman at gunpoint while House met Cuddy and got the drugs. The man demanded House give the drug to someone else before giving it to him. He pointed out a man in a baseball cap who should take it. House gave the man in the ball cap the shot, then quickly turned and asked the hostage taker to roll up his sleeve. In a few seconds, the man in the ball cap collapse and House's jig was up. \"You think I'm an idiot?\" the sick man asked, pointing the gun at House. \"I thought I had a little more time with a guy that size,\" House said. He pointed the gun at House angrily, but House knew he wouldn't shoot him. \"You still need me,\" House said. The man pointed the gun at someone else. \"You're right, I need you,\" the sick man said. \"I also need you to know you can't screw with me.\" Then he shot the other man in the leg.The phone rang. \"It's for you,\" House said.The phone kept ringing and the sick man kept hanging it up. The SWAT team arrived and told Cuddy they'd take care of communicating with anyone in her office. \"You got a husband in there or a loved one?\" he asked her. Cuddy said no. \"Don't worry, we'll decide when to start shooting.\"House's fellows all huddled around a phone to help with the diagnosis. He gave the symptoms, but Chase (Jesse Spencer) refused to help the figure out the hostage taker's illness. \"You think he's the only guy in New Jersey with an unsolved illness and a pistol?\" Chase asked. He left, but Cameron (Jennifer Morrison) said he was still there. House went through the fellows, asking them each for their opinion and taking his notes in permanent marker on Cuddy's office wall.House was talking to the hostage negotiator, Bowman (Wood Harris), when the sick man hung the phone up and told everyone to be quiet. He heard SWAT team officers outside, which gave House another symptom. No one else heard them, which meant the guy had hyperacusis. It was nerve related. House told the man he could test for neuralgia. The test would only be painful if he didn't have the disorder.The hostage negotiator, calling the man Jason, demanded he release two hostages before any more meds would be brought in. Jason (Zeljko Ivanek) said Cuddy had to bring everything in, not cops. She agreed. The negotiator told Cuddy she had to reveal whether she had a conflict or stakes in the situation he didn't know about. She didn't. Cuddy took in the meds and brought back two hostages.No one wanted to take the first dose until Thirteen stepped up and said, \"I'll do it.\" House told her she was \"waving a white flag at the world.\" She took the dose and crumbled to the floor, whimpering in pain. Jason took the medicine and also fell to the floor in pain. House crossed the nerve hypothesis off the list. Foreman found it wasn't a lung infection. Thirteen said his problem was his heart because of a distended jugular.They had to do something to slow Jason's heart and Thirteen went outside to get a drug to do it. Jason gave her 30 seconds and if she wasn't back he'd shoot someone. Thirteen was outside getting the meds when some SWAT offices knocked on a door. She looked at them, froze momentarily and eventually went back into Cuddy's office. Jason made her take the drug, which was dangerous because it would slow her heartbeat, which was fine as it it. She did, then collapsed.House gave Jason the shot, which brought his heartbeat back to normal. House noticed Jason was sweating on one side of his face but not the other. House said Jason had lung cancer.A nurse, Regina (Tracy Vilar), said Thirteen's pulse was down below 50. \"So's her IQ,\" House said. House called Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) to help his diagnose the lung cancer. Jason needed an X-ray and asked House how many hostages it would cost him for a trip to radiology. There were just five hostages left, and they tied themselves to each other, with Jason in the middle, for their walk to radiology. House pressed Jason for a reason why he would go to such extremes and Jason, in the X-ray machine, said he'd rather rot in jail knowing what was wrong with him than not know. Jason insisted on holding his gun during the test. The metal from the gun was creating a starburst artifact, meaning they couldn't see what was wrong.House told Jason, \"You either give me the gun, or shoot me.\" Jason said he wasn't going to give up the gun. Some commotion happened outside the X-ray room and two hostages ran out. Cuddy asked how they got Jason to release them and one, the nurse, said, \"House got him to give up his gun. We just ran.\"One kid stayed and House asked why he was still there. \"Curious,\" the kid said. \"It's safe now, right?\"House said there was no tumor. \"I don't know what you have,\" he said. \"So, it's over,\" Jason said. \"Thanks for trying.\" House handed Jason his gun.The phone rang and House answered, saying, \"He overpowered me, got his gun back,\" before hanging up. Thirteen called House a coward and said he was so terrified of not knowing something, of just being an ordinary doctor, he'd risk other people's lives to solve the case. House told Thirteen she was the coward for thinking she was in control by trying to bring on death sooner than her disease could do it for her.The negotiator wondered whether House was now rooting for the hostage taker. \"I hope your boyfriend knows what he's doing,\" he told Cuddy.The team discussed more options and House noticed the man turning his head, meaning he was losing his hearing in one ear. They sent in drugs on the condition Jason gave up one more hostage and didn't test any more drugs on Thirteen. The drugs came in but Jason insisted Thirteen take them anyway. House worried the new drug would cause Thirteen's liver to fail. She developed a dangerously fast heartbeat and a fever, and House was forced to lie her down. It turned out that all the medicine Jason had forced Thirteen to take was making her kidneys fail.House rang his team on his mobile.\n\"The Prednisolone is making Thirteen's kidneys fail but not the pacients. Why?\"Cameron suggested Melioidosis, which spreads in tropical climates. \"I've never been anywhere south of Florida,\" Jason said. Jason didn't realize Florida counted as tropical.House then slapped Jason across the face for diagnostic purposes, revealing a twitch below his eye. Something was protecting Jason's kidneys. House asked for the drugs to cure Melioidosis, but the negotiators wouldn't send in any more drugs. Jason offered House in exchange for the drugs. House knew Jason planned on giving Thirteen the drugs, which could kill her since her kidneys were already failing. House offered to let him stay and take the drugs, but Jason said no, she had taken everything that he had taken. Thirteen told House to leave, calling him the martyr for staying. She said either the drugs would kill her or Jason would kill her, so it didn't make much difference.House walked out and they tossed in the syringe. Thirteen asked Jason, \"You really don't feel bad about killing me?\" He replied, \"Not if you don't feel bad about killing yourself.\" She said she didn't want to die, but Jason said she just didn't have the nerve to do it. \"You just want it out of your control,\" he said. \"It is. Because I've got a gun.\"She put the syringe near her arm, but stopped and said, \"Don't do this.\" Jason pointed the gun at her while the SWAT team outside the room prepared to make a big move.Thirteen couldn't go through with injecting and, effectively killing herself. She told Jason she didn't want to die while the first tears rolled down her face. He slammed the gun down, took the syringe and jammed it into his arm just as the wall to the door exploded, the force from the explosion forcing both Jason and Thirteen to the ground.In slow motion, SWAT team members went into the room and arrested Jason while House limped as quickly as he could to Thirteen. He helped her over onto her back, and surpirised, asked her why she was still alive. \"He didn't make me take it,\" was all she said.House walked out into the hospital lobby, popped a couple of Vicodin. Outside of the room, Cuddy looks up and sees House with a worried face. House looks around and finds Jason, who looked better than he had all day, as he was taken away by the cops. House puts his hand to his chest, motioning for him to take a breath. Jason takes a healthy, smooth breath, and smiles. House nods, and Jason nods, and he gave a slight smile. House breathed a sigh of relief in response as Jason moves away in handcuffs.In the next scene, Thirteen was just waking up in a hospital bed. Foreman was at her side, and a bouquet of flowers was nearby. Foreman told Thirteen a week's worth of dialysis and she'd be OK. He also apologized to her for leaving the differential diagnosis earlier. \"About that Huntington's drug trial,\" she said with a smile, without finishing. Foreman returned her smile.Cuddy walked in to find the scary and bloody scene inside her office. She was upset House enabled the hostage taker. He thanked her for enabling every medical move he made. She asked if he thought she handled things differently because he was involved. He said sarcastically, \"I don't know. Let's try it again without me.\" She said that was why the two of them couldn't be \"a thing.\"\"If you're suggesting that you screwed up because of a non-relationship with me, I don't know how I can help you,\" House said. \"Because the only change you can make from a non-relationship is...\"\"Do you want a relationship?\" Cuddy asked.\"God, no,\" House said. \"I'm just trying to follow your logic.\"Cuddy opened her desk drawer and everything fell out. House smiled and walked out.", "episode_18": "House (Hugh Laurie) has some fun with medical supplies, making a toy car track including a shark pool made out of a bed pan.\nCuddy (Lisa Edelstein) ruins his fun by bringing him a patient.A woman feels run down and starts to request tests. Then she collapses and starts convulsing. House, not exactly rushing to help, calls for Cuddy. The woman pees on herself mid-seizure. This is not odd, but the fact it's neon green is.It goes on the board along with neurological symptoms. Taub (Peter Jacobson) walks in late and questions why House is interested in the non-life threatening case.Taub and Kutner (Kal Penn) check out her office at a nursing home. Taub finds pills that would make her pee green. He thinks she's faking.Houses guesses a throat spray is the cause and sends Taub out. He cops to Kutner he's only trying to disprove the fake seizure story.Some guy in the waiting room recognizes Taub as a high school classmate. Taub agrees to look at the man's hurt leg.House tells the woman a test was negative and runs some flashing lights in her face to provoke a seizure. It works. But too conveniently. She's faking.\nHe's going to need a good reason to keep her. A cat predicted her death.\n\"Cat's make terrible doctors,\" House says. \"Oh no wait, that's women. You're screwed.\"Taub's friend Neil (Christopher Moynihan) has been feeling dizzy. He has him lay down and manipulates his head. The guy sits up, cured. He had a tiny calcium deposit in his head and Taub just moved it. Taub turns down his offer of dinner.Morgan (Judy Greer) brings the cat to the hospital and tells him it has predicted 10 deaths at the nursing home, sleeping next to them before they died. The other day, it slept next to her as she napped. She's convinced it's real.From inside his office, House ignores her until she collapses. Foreman (Omar Epps) checks her out. She's having bronchial spasms. You can't fake that. Good, kitty.House and Cuddy watch the news reel Morgan brought in about the cat. Cuddy thinks the woman is a whack job. House doesn't disagree, but still thinks she's sick.\nCuddy gives him 24 hours to prove he's right.House holds the cat and chews on a giant cigar. He notes rich people sometimes send them as gifts and asks if Taub picked up on the awkward segue. Taub goes to look for his cigars as the team spitballs.\nForeman guesses the cat caused the deaths and House tells him he shouldn't listen to Ted Nugent.\nOk, so they didn't die of Cat Scratch Fever.Taub finds the empty cigar box. House guesses Taub is getting gifts from rich guys because he lost all his money on the market. Taub accidentally left his portfolio open on the computer.Kutner tries to talk to Taub as the team tests for worms in Morgan's lungs. There are none.Houses pushes a crash cart into the coma patients room. He opens it up and takes out the cat, trying to disprove the cat death theory.Taub thinks House and Foreman misinterpreted the breath sounds and Morgan is fine.They notice new welts on a coma patient's arms. Thirteen (Olivia Wilde) reads his file: he has a severe cat allergy. They notice the cat has settled in on another patient's bed.Cuddy tells House to get rid of Morgan. The latest test they ran showed nothing. Taub tattled.House pushes Morgan in a wheelchair outside where he fires up Taub's cigar. He went through her file and saw she got a chicken pox shot two years ago, which you only get if you have a kid. It was her stepson. He choked in school.\nShe wants to make it make sense, House says. But it's meaningless. He blows smoke in her face until she starts wheezing again. Hooray, she's officially sick.House tells Taub to clean the litter box, but Taub leaves instead. They start Morgan on steroids.Taub has a drink with Neil in his fancy CEO's office. Taub thinks about his past rich life and talks about the affair he had with one of his partner's daughters.He looks over a medical implement Neil is developing and gives him useful advice on how to make it better.Back at the hospital, Morgan tells Thirteen she peed brown. Not a good sign.House comes in the next day to talk pee.\nForeman wonders what plus green makes brown. Something purple, which could be related to colon cancer.\nHouse tries to provoke Kutner's superstitions, opening an umbrella, spilling salt and putting a ladder over the doorway - which Kutner avoids going under.House asks Taub to stay and ribs him about poverty, still angry Taub ratted him out to Cuddy.House takes Morgan to see the cat with the coma dude - who is not dead yet. Morgan thinks the cat might just be confused by the new environment. She knows she sounds crazy, but she also knows House is wrong.Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) confronts House in the hallway, wondering why House is attacking the beliefs of a woman who lost her kid.They're going experimenting up in pediatrics. Wilson puts a stop to it.The colonoscopy shows Morgan has no tumor in her colon. Kutner suggests a flat lesion - skin cancer. He wants to leave but the cat blocks his path. Kutner goes out the side door.In the middle of the night, House's phone rings.\nMorgan now has spider veins on her back which means Cushings. But that's not why Kutner called. Mr. Coma Patient just died. The cat was right.But it's also missing. They go looking for it while trying to guess how a cat could tell when people are sick. Suddenly, House collapses, then he spits up all over Kutner. It looks like blood. But no, it's cranberry juice. That'll teach Kutner to leave House's office door open.Taub meets with Neil, telling him he wants a job. But there isn't one available. He asks to invest instead. Neil protests slightly, then agrees.House checks out Mr. Coma Man in the morgue. Chase (Jesse Spencer) reports the test they did nearly killed her. He's still thinking Cushings.Wilson is confounded by House's latest obsession.Chase tells Morgan about drugs that will suppress Cushings. The other option is really risky surgery to remove her pituitary gland. She wants the surgery.House comes in to work. Taub is at work early. He's quitting. He doesn't have a new job, so House won't accept his resignation.\nTaub says bye and walks out. House tells him to bring bear claws when he comes back.In his office, House notices the kitty in the doorway. It comes in and lays on his laptop. Looking back at the news footage of the cat on a woman's bed, House smiles.Taub waits for Neil at his office. Finally a woman comes out and tells him Neil's not there. He doesn't work there any more. He wasn't the CEO, he was a temp. He's in custody.\nTaub sputters he went to high school with the guy.\nThat's what everyone else thought, too, she tells him. Luckily, Taub hasn't given him the money yet.House goes to Wilson to gloat. The cat was attracted to the warmth of feverish patients and the heating blankets put on patients that were wasting away.\n\"Congrats,\" Wilson says, \"because of your obsession with this cat you solved a completely trivial mystery.\"Somehow, Morgan's symptoms actually mean she had cancer in a place the camera couldn't reach - her appendix.She packs up as House drops by to gloat. She believes it wasn't just coincidence the cat chose that moment to sit on House's computer.He tells her to feel better.Back in his office, House sits in his chair and starts to play with his toy cars. He realizes his chair is wet with cat pee.\nHe calls for Kutner. Payback for fake blood.Thirteen is surprised Kutner is still alive after that and figures it must be because House was impressed Kutner stood up to him, or he got a cat to pee on his chair. \"Yea,\" Kutner says mischievously, \"a cat.\"As he's walking to the elevator House passes Taub returning - with a box of bear claws.", "episode_8": "We opened on a factory where metal sheets were being cut into squares by a massive blade on a conveyor belt. A young woman who seemed to be running things suddenly clutched her chest and fell onto the conveyor belt. Her co-worker stopped the machine just before she went under the blade. She continued holding her chest and pink foam came out of her mouth.Cue super cool opening credits music!House told Wilson he didn't ask Cuddy out. Wilson had nothing to say about it. House was suspicious.The patient was a 16-year-old girl named Sophia who claimed to have been emancipated after her parents died a year earlier. Foreman suggested she might be pregnant, but Kutner didn't want to believe it because her history said she wasn't sexually active. House asked for a pregnancy test. Kutner also believed Sophia wasn't on drugs. House asked for a test for toxins and drugs.Foreman asked House if he could take some time to help run a clinical trial. Foreman promised his patients with House would be his priority, but House said no. \"Clinical trials take time,\" House said. \"Your time is my time.\"Kutner talked to Sophia about his parents dying when he was 6, in an effort to show sympathy. Her heart was healthy, which meant they still didn't know what was wrong with her. While checking out Sophia's apartment, Thirteen told Taub she was annoyed with Kutner's blind trust and need to have everything be \"nice.\" She said trust should be earned, just as she held up a bong she found.The doctors talked about their options with the new possibility that Sophia was on drugs and House had Foreman start her on beta-blockers, telling everyone else to do anything that wasn't starting her on beta-blockers. After House left the room, Foreman told the other doctors to start the treatment and page him if they needed him.Kutner told Sophia they'd found the bong, but she said it was her ex's. That's why he became her ex. She said they didn't have any reason to believe her. Kutner told Sophia the other possibility was vasculitis and the treatment was steroids. If they gave her steroids and drugs had damaged her heart, the steroids could kill her. Sophia reiterated she hadn't done drugs. \"I'll get the steroids,\" Kutner said.Foreman showed up at the clinic and Cuddy knew House had said no. She wouldn't override House's decision. Instead, she gave Foreman a chance to prove he could do House's job and handed him a folder. She gave Foreman the case of little boy who was vomiting blood and no one knew why.Sophia was raging in her hospital room and while Taub and Kutner restrained her, Taub said, \"Beta blockers don't cause psychotic breaks.\" \"She's not on beta blockers,\" Kutner admitted.House blamed Foreman for \"sticking it to the man\" and inspiring Kutner to go rogue. House said Kutner treated her based on \"empathetic orphan syndrome.\" Kutner insisted she wasn't on the steroids long enough for them to have caused her break. He thought it was a new symptom. Foreman suggested Prinzmetal's angina could be causing an artery in the brain to spasm. House ordered Foreman to do an MRI -- and he meant Foreman. He wanted Foreman's signature on the paperwork, videotape, and photographs of Foreman with the patient in the newspaper. Foreman told the rest of the team to set up the procedure and page him when it was ready. He went to work on his other patient.Foreman gave the young boy a pill that had a camera in it. The kid's older brother convinced him to swallow it by telling him it was a special vitamin, just like the ones they had to take at home. The young patient suddenly began laughing for no apparent reason, and Foreman didn't know why.Chase and Cameron alert! Foreman went to the cafeteria to work on a differential diagnosis with Chase and Cameron. He's getting the band back together! Foreman told them he wasn't work with House on this case and Chase warned Foreman that whatever he was trying to prove, it wouldn't be enough. Foreman got paged and went to do the MRI on Sophia. There were no spasms, but Kutner noticed certain parts of Sophia's brain -- the parts that light up when people use their imaginations -- were lighting up as Sophia talked about her parents' deaths. She was lying. She confessed and said she lied because her father raped her and her mother pretended it never happened.As the doctors discussed the case further, Kutner began wondering whether Sophia was also lying about being raped. Thirteen suddenly jumped to Sophia's defense, saying it was understandable that she lied about her parents' death if she were covering up the rape story. House posited stress was causing the problems and had Thirteen put Sophia on anti-anxiety meds. He had Foreman make sure she did it, and had Thirteen make sure Foreman made sure.House told Wilson he went to Cuddy's house but didn't go in. Wilson offered no opinion.Foreman went back to Chase and Cameron for more differentials on the run. Foreman decided \"we\" should run a couple of tests, with \"we\" meaning Chase and Cameron. He said \"thanks\" as he walked away to treat Sophia. Her urine was brown, meaning her problem wasn't stress.While the team talked about Sophia's new symptoms, Foreman got a page. He got up and walked out while telling the doctors how to test Sophia for arsenic poisoning. Chase told Foreman the tests on the little boy were negative for stomach cancer and porphyria. Chase said they were done and suggested Foreman talk to House. \"There's a point when Cameron and I aren't enough,\" Chase said. \"We're not there,\" Foreman replied. \"We need to run some more tests.\" The boy went into cardiac arrest. \"Foreman,\" Chase said, \" we're there.Thirteen told Sophia she was arsenic free and could leave the hospital the next day. Sophia wanted advice from Thirteen, who told her she's strong and makes good choices. \"You'll be fine,\" she said. Sophia then had a seizure.Sophia's brain suddenly had lesions, which weren't there three days earlier. House thought they should give her arsenic because it wasn't killing her and may have been saving her. Thirteen thought Sophia might have a certain form leukemia. She might need a bone marrow transplant from an immediate relative.Foreman wanted to talk to House, but House already knew about the case Foreman didn't want him to know about. \"He needs you,\" Foreman told House. \"But he has you,\" House replied. Foreman tried to talk House into helping the patient because it's their job as doctors. \"You wanted to do something on your own, now you've got it,\" House told Foreman.House again tried to get Wilson to give his opinion on the Cuddy situation.Sophia refused to get bone marrow from her parents, saying if she did it she would owe them her life. She would rather die. Taub interjected by telling Sophia that he had Huntington's Disease -- using Thirteen's story -- and wanted to live what was left of his life as well as he possibly could. Sophia asked if he'd ever been raped. When he said no, she told him not to try to walk in her shoes and she wouldn't try to walk in his.Thirteen was upset that Taub lied to Sophia. House told the doctors to run the donor banks for a bone marrow transplant, knowing the patient wouldn't agree to get in touch with her parents. Thirteen insisted on tracking down Sophia's parents despite House's objection.Foreman, Chase and Cameron sat around trying to figure out what they'd missed with the young boy's case. Foreman talked about how over-protective the older brother was with his little brother. Foreman left. \"We gave him an idea,\" Chase said. \"Either that,\" Cameron responded, \"or he's off to kill House.\"Thirteen went to what she thought was Sophia's parents' house and discovered Sophia lied about who she was. Sophia told Thirteen she'd stolen another girl's identity to protect herself against her family finding her. Thirteen told Sophia her parents would have to sign off on any operation she might have, but Sophia still refused to reveal her real identity and decided to wait until her situation became an emergency, in which case the doctors would have to operate with or without consent.Foreman's young patient was suffering from an iron overdose after his older brother had given him too many vitamins. The older brother was afraid his little brother would hate him, but Foreman told him, \"That's the great thing about brothers. You make mistakes, they'll still love you.\"Kutner found a partial donor match, but Thirteen was worried a partial match would be rejected. House and the team talked about Sophia's emotional reactions versus rational reactions. House was intrigued by the fact that Sophia's position (she didn't want to give her parents the satisfaction of saving her life) was rational, not emotional. But he said it didn't make sense that she skipped any emotional reaction, meaning she had no emotional reaction to process. House wondered what was worse than rape, because he thought she was lying about it.House got in her head and tried to figure out what she'd done that she was really hiding. Finally, she confessed that she'd killed her brother, She was supposed to watch him. He was in the bath. She could hear him laughing. \"Every time they look at me it's like I kill him again,\" Sophia said. \"If you don't take your parents' bone marrow, you'll be killing their other child,\" House said.He said there was nothing she could do to change how bad her situation was, but there was one thing she could do to not make it worse. Her parents came to the hospital. They cried when they reunited.Foreman went back to House and said he wanted to do clinical trials, because he'd proven he could do two cases at once. \"And I'm doing it,\" Foreman said. \"OK,\" House said. The explanation: Foreman didn't ask this time, he told House what he was going to do. House couldn't say no if it wasn't a question.Wilson and House left the hospital together and saw Cuddy from afar. \"You want to talk about her?\" Wilson asked House.\"Nope,\" House said.", "episode_17": "A number of books are on display at a luncheon, and the author, whose face stares out from the dustjacket as the scene opens, is sitting at a table with his publisher. He talks\nabout his fear of public speaking, and his publisher informs him he's going to have to get over it before the book tour. She clinks her knife on her\nglass and announces the author has a few words to say. When it looks like the novelist is going to drone on for a bit the publisher cuts him off and toasts the book as a bestseller. Everyone raises their\nglasses and there are cheers all around -- except for the man to the author's left, Nick Greenwald (Jay Karnes). \"Well, that's not going to happen,\" Nick says, adding, \"Short stories weren't doing well in 1908. You'd have to be\nmathematically illiterate to think they'd do as well as a novel.\"The publisher gently tells him to step away from the champagne. Nick looks puzzled at what he just said.The author turns to Nick and asks why Northrup would publish the book if he thought it was going to fail. \"Have you noticed you're our star author? Elaine didn't want to offend you,\" Nick replies. Then he apologizes, saying he has no idea why he's saying these things. Elaine, the publisher, suggests Nick must be joking. Nick turns on Elaine, saying \"Do you really think that someone who goes through 10 assistants a year and doesn't return her own children's phone calls could give a damn about the state of the American short story?\"Nick wipes his nose -- it's bleeding. \"I think something's wrong,\" he says. Then he turns back to the author and tells him the title was wrong too. \"People are going to compare you to Salinger. Boy, are you going to come up short with that one.\" Then Nick falls out of his chair, passing out.Cue TV's most incredible theme music! \"Teardrop,\" by Massive Attack.House (Hugh Laurie) walks in to the news that Cameron brought up a case from the ER -- one Nick Greenwald, who was diagnosed with frontal lobe disinhibition. Kutner (Kal Penn) likens him to Phineas Gage. House asks if he has a railroad spike through this head. Thirteen (Olivia Wilde) explains Gage became a different person after the spike - argumentative, explosive.\"Whereas our guy became a different person after chardonnay,\" House finishes. MRI shows nothing. Good -- what fun would that be? So, House, tells the team, the tumor's not in a cool neighborhood. \"It's in a cool neighborhood, adjacent,\" he quips. Perhaps a tumor near the nasal cavity would do the same damage. And they're off.Kutner and Taub (Peter Jacobson) greet Nick, who's in a hospital bed playing cards with his daughter Marika and revealing what he's holding. Kutner greets the patient with a smile and tells him he's sorry he's not feeling well, and Nick replies he doesn't look sorry. In fact, he looks cheerful. He tells Kutner it's creepy, how cheerful he looks. This guy's gonna be fun! Taub informs Nick he's going to put a probe up his nose to see what's going on and assures him they're completely unexcited about that. He says \"excuse me, sweetie\" to Nick's daughter. Nick's wife explains the little girl has an auditory processing disability. Nick\ngently leans in and tells her to get off the bed. Nick's wife says she's going to step out to make arrangements for a breast cancer walk she's coordinating, and Nick tells her he'll pretend not to freak out while they stuff the tube up his nose. Then he looks at Taub's nose and says it's too bad he's not getting a tube up there - lots more room to maneuver. The wife decides the breast cancer details can wait. Nick then asks why tying up traffic for six hours helps cure breast cancer and asks why they can't build houses for Habitat for Humanity, or if it's wrong to help two charities at once. The wife points out he was supportive last year, and he replies he had to be because she wouldn't have sex with him if he wasn't. She decides it's a good time to make her call after all, and\nleaves. TMI anyone?\"Make this go away,\" Nick quietly pleads, adding to Taub, \"God, that honker really is huge, isn't it?\"In the hallway, House is trying to convince Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) to accompany him to a monster truck rally, and Wilson admits not only does he not want to go, but he has never liked monster trucks. \"I'm saying it loud and proud. Death to monster trucks!\" Kutner comes out with the report: no nasal cancer, but the patient will have\na divorce on his hands if they don't stop him from saying everything which pops into his head.Wilson turns to House. \"You always led me to believe that you were one of a kind,\" he says. Kutner points out jerkiness is a temporary condition for Nick, but House contends it isn't. They may be able to fix his impulses to say things out loud, but he's always going to think them. Wilson contends he'll also be the guy who doesn't say them, and surely that counts as his true persona. House tells Wilson of course he'd say that -- he's nothing but persona. Kutner interjects, saying he agrees with Wilson, likening Nick to Harry Potter. He explains the Sorting Hat wanted to put Harry in Slytherin based on his nature. He refused, so he ended up in Gryfindor. By choice. House snaps at Kutner, telling him to look for the damage in Nick's brain.Foreman (Omar Epps) and Thirteen are readying Nick for another test, and Nick takes the opportunity to tell Thirteen she's a pleasure to imagine naked. Then he apologizes.\nThat's when Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) walks into the room and Nick goes to town, telling her what he'd like to do to her with the assistance of fudge and a cherry on top. He talks about what he's imagining in a king sized bed with a mirror on the ceiling, but tells Cuddy if he couldn't have her and Thirteen together, Cuddy would be his first choice. Cuddy correctly surmises House wouldn't have called her up there if there wasn't a way for him to watch this exchange for his own entertainment and --\nta dah! He's watching in a nearby observation room. As she stalks out Nick offers, \"Your tush is like the pistons in a Ferrari.\"House follows her and she asks why he did that. He points out she's 40 years old (\"38,\" Cuddy quickly corrects him) and a man with no inhibitions informed her he prefers her body to that of a smoking hot twentysomething. Surely she must have gotten a kick out of that? \"Don't be ridiculous, House,\" she says, getting into the elevator. As he walks away, Cuddy cracks a satisfied smirk as the elevator doors close.Meanwhile, Foreman asks Thirteen if she was hurt Nick found Cuddy more attractive, and she insists that's not the case, telling Foreman she prefers men with brains, who admire the whole package. He points out even men with brains say one thing but think something completely different. On to the test. They ask Nick something personal but inoffensive, if he votes the same way as his wife. He snarkily admits he doesn't vote at all. Thirteen asks how he can be 46 and never have voted, and he tells her the disapproval in her voice makes her less attractive, \"although I'm sure that will pass.\" Foreman notices on the monitor a section of his brain isn't lighting up and thinks it could be neural sarcoidosis, treatable with a round of steroids. Thirteen gets up to leave, and Foreman watches her, or a part of her specifically, go. She stops and asks what he's looking at.\"I find your strong attachment to a working democracy to be extremely sexy,\" Foreman says.In the cafeteria, Taub asks Kutner if his nose is too big. Kutner tells him to relax, reminding him the guy said his bedside manner was a little off, and asks Taub if he agrees with that. Taub pauses before saying, \"No.\" Kutner asks if anyone's ever said anything about Taub's nose before, since he is a plastic surgeon, and Taub replies they say it suits his face. Kutner assures him it does, and Taub replies, \"Maybe. Or, maybe it's the social contract.\"\nIn other words, he tells Kutner his bedside manner is fine, and Kutner tells him his nose suits his face. Kutner offers he could ask for the truth. Taub leans in to the lunchlady and asks her what she thinks of his nose, asking her to be honest. \"It's fine,\" she deadpans. \"It's a nose.\" Taub thanks her and adds, \"Just proving a point.\"House asks Wilson if anyone is sitting with him and he offers, \"Just my persona.\" House wonders why people cling to insults, or what they think are insults. He wonders if more people aren't like our patient, hiding a dark compulsive core under a candy coating of niceness. Wilson says he's not nice all the time, and House corrects him:\nWilson isn't nice to him, because nice bores House. House then suggests Wilson has no core, that whomever he's with determines what he needs to be. House admits that could be an insult, but then asks, why? \"Because when my parents put me in a rocket and sent me here, they said, 'James, you will grow to manhood under\na yellow sun,'\" Wilson jokes. House asks why Wilson lied about monster trucks, saying he checked his appointment book and saw Wilson had plans already. Wilson tells House he's playing racquetball that night with Taub. House asks why Wilson would lie about that, and Wilson reminds House he thinks the world revolves around him, and if he found out anyone else had Wilson's attention, he'd end up stalking and harassing that person. \"You say that as if it wouldn't be fun,\" House tells him.Wilson then admits he didn't want to rub House's face in the fact he was doing something with someone else House could no longer participate in...because he's a nice guy. He gets up and walks away, leaving House to ponder this cruel coup de grace over his lunch.Foreman runs to check on Nick, who is sweating and breathing heavily. He realizes the steroids aren't working, but something's wrong with his kidneys. They put Nick on dialysis.Later, Taub's checking out his nose in a spoon's reflection. House, calling him Cyrano de Berkowitz, tells him to let it go. The team bounces around theoretical diagnoses, shooting them down one by one. House stares down Taub and asks him innocently (but not really) how long he's been playing racquetball with Wilson. \"First of all, Wilson played tennis on his college team,\" House says. \"And you...are a Jew.\" He tells Taub he's not athletic. Taub points out Sandy Koufax was Jewish, and House pooh-poohs him, saying that Jews always go on about Sandy Koufax, and the Holocaust. \"It gets old.\"More diagnostic banter, which House interrupts with\na trick sports question for Taub. Taub answers correctly and, returning to the subject at hand, suggests diabetes. House agrees, saying diabetes\nmakes more sense, and says they should test for peripheral nerve damage. Thirteen says if he has brain damage, he's likely to have peripheral nerve damage, and House agrees, and suggests Kutner test the daughter for it. He tells Taub to run the glucose test -- oh, and let the nurses take the night off, he can do the blood draws. Taub accuses House of punishing him for spending time with his best friend. \"That would be petty,\" House says. \"I'm punishing you because now you've joined my best friend in lying to me. Let me know when you're ready to confess everything.\" Class dismissed.Kutner sets up the daughter for testing, strapping nodes to the daughter's hands and feet and telling the little girl with a smile the better she does, the better her daddy does. He sits in the monitoring room with Nick's wife, who admits what he's been saying is disconcerting and she can't believe he's thinking all of those horrible things. Kutner remarks Marika\nshould be feeling something by now, and the little girl screams. He runs in and asks why she didn't tell him that she was being burned and she repeats what Kutner said to her -- the better she does, the better her daddy does. Kutner apologizes to the wife.Nick is chatting with Taub and admits he has ignoble thoughts, but that's not who he wants to be to people, especially to his wife. \"My real choices are my actions,\" he says, saying he's never done anything to hurt her and he's never cheated. Taub looks down. Nick is surprised, saying, \"You're kidding me -- you've cheated?\" Taub adamantly says no, and asks why Nick would say that. \"Because you look guilty as hell,\" Nick answers, adding everyone probably knows. Taub walks away, and Nick yells after him everyone might not know, they might be idiots.House is in the morgue, tossing a racquet ball in his hand, and Taub enters, asking House why he was paged. House tells him he wants an update on the patient while Taub hits the racquetball against the wall. He says he expects the people who work for him to rise to a challenge, unless they don't expect to work for him. Taub picks up a nearby racquet and hits the ball off of the wall, updating him on Nick's bloodwork until the ball crashes into a cabinet, knocking down supplies. Taub confesses everything -- he never played racquetball with Wilson, he just thought it would be a good idea if a department head owed him a favor. House commends him on putting on a good show, but points out a real racquetball player would have noticed he was hitting with a squash racquet. House, you cagey so-and-so! He has Kutner do a thyroid re-uptake scan, and goes to grab a nap.Kutner goes to explain the test to the patient, but Nick interrupts and asks why Marika, who is sitting in the room, has a bandage on one of her hands. Kutner explains since the kid has a neurological\ncondition the team thought testing her could help diagnose his condition. Nick explains she has no disability, her issue with auditory processing is code for, \"I don't want to admit that my daughter is not perfect.\" The tests\nthey ran on her were inconclusive. She gets below average marks in school and she daydreams. They don't know what's wrong with her. He prattles on about parents refusing to admit their children are below average, then tells Marika he doesn't think she's stupid -- her mother isn't the sharpest knife in the drawer, and she does just fine. Marika runs out of the room, and Nick's upset and starts coughing. He's burning up and his lungs are full of fluid.More diagnostic banter around the meeting table -- they've decided it's an infection. House sends Kutner off to quiz the patient again and again until they figure out what caused the infection. Then he tells Taub he has a different task for him.Cut to Taub in the doorway of Wilson's office, asking him if they can have lunch. Wilson notes this is unusual, and Taub tells Wilson he's been made, House is sending him back to Wilson to act as a double agent. Wilson groans and holds his head in his hands.Kutner is bedside with Nick and advises his wife to get some rest. Nick agrees. The wife is upset, wondering if there's something even worse he hasn't said to her yet, and Nick says no, but he has no idea how he's going to hurt her next and he'd rather they were around each other as little as possible. \"This is pathetic,\"\nthe wife says, and gets up to leave. Nick says, \"Tell Marika I love her very much.\" The wife says Marika understands, but Nick doubts she does.Kutner walks past House as he's staking out Wilson's office. Kutner tells House the guy leads a boring life. His wife, however, rescues dogs. Among others, a big Rottweiler that's taken over their place. The patient hates this. \"Was his wife there to hear that?\" House asks. Kutner says no. \"Too bad,\" House says, \"go on.\"\nThe dog marks all over the living room, where the guy eats and drinks. One night he put a glass of juice on the floor while he was fixing the television. The patient's eyes are red. It's a bacterial infection. House orders a round of antibiotics.As Kutner walks away, Taub emerges from Wilson's office and reveals he told Wilson that House sent him to spy. He's also printed out his e-mails -- the ones he wanted House to see, and the deleted ones as well. The top one is an ongoing message to a J Gonzales at New York Mercy. House looks up the hospital directory and finds a Joan Gonzales, an oncologist. He thinks it's a date and Taub tells him no, it's a consult. There was a file attached, but it's password protected. House knows the only person Wilson would password protect anything from was House, which makes no sense, because there's only one patient House is interested in. Taub wonders if Wilson has cancer. It doesn't make sense to House why Wilson would ask an outside doctor for a consult\nif he were indeed sick, since he can pull strings where he is to get the best treatment. House takes a closer look at the doctor's work and sees she's written several papers on managing suicidal ideation accompanying diagnosis. Taub asks if Wilson has ever exhibited signs of being depressed. House turns around and says no, then brusquely says, \"Get out of here.\"Nick's fever is down and his lungs are clearing. Foreman tells him he has to live with the damage the infection did. Dude is not happy. He wants some better doctors at a better hospital to go into his brain stem and do some hacking. They promise him he won't get any worse.\nHe kicks them out.House catches Wilson coming back from a walk, and, Spidey sense tingling, he knows something is up. Taub has ratted Wilson out, calling him another graduate of the House school of being a dick.\"Private dick,\" House corrects him.House tries to figure why Wilson would go for a walk even though it's 45 degrees out. Clearly, this must mean Wilson hates himself, House reasons.Nick confronts House, not excited about the prospect of a life where he might continually drive away anyone who might care about him. House tells Nick he might die if they operate. \"So I'm either better or dead?\" Nick says, \"I'm OK with that.\" He just wants to get back to the life he had, the one where he made his wife and daughter happy. Anything else, he says, is no life at all.House presents the case to Chase. He wants him to convince his neurosurgeon boss to operate.Chase wants to know why House would care. House says the patient has a quality of life issue. Chase points out it's not unique to the patient. House explains if they don't take care of this, he'll lose his family, alienate anybody he'll run into and if he finds a friend who can put up with him, he'll be lucky. Clearly House sees parallels to himself in this patient. Chase agrees to look into it.Chase is in surgery. House watches.\nWilson joins him, suggesting he might have over-reacted. House has sussed it out, admitting he found the e-mail but dug deeper and found another J. Gonzales at the hospital, a nurse in the psych ward. Wilson found his brother sleeping in the lobby of a building and now he's in treatment. Wilson says he should be in shape to talk to him tonight. Wilson's going to New York. House wants to know why he wouldn't tell him, clearly not being terribly self-aware.Wilson says he's worried about how his brother Danny will react when he sees him, and House, as expected, says Wilson is worried it might go horribly wrong. In which case, House says, Wilson might want company.After surgery, Nick wakes up. He knows he's a \"former SOB.\"\nHe addresses his wife. \"Maybe she'll stop whining and cut me some slack now that I've risked my life,\" he says.\nSo, maybe the surgery didn't work.Foreman and Taub try to figure out what went wrong as Nick tells his wife what he really thinks about his wife's job (\"I think people who publicize important things are people who can't do important things themselves. Honey, stop.\") Does he regret marrying her? (\"Sometimes,\" he says) She asks if he really loves her. (Yes on that last one, right as Nick goes into ventricular tachycardia which, even if you don't know what it means, is clearly bad.)The team, sans House, tries to figure out why Nick's temp is dropping. Lungs, heart and kidneys are mentioned.They argue what House would think, but he's not there.They run Nick through a scan.Wilson and House wait in an austere lobby. Wilson hasn't seen his brother in 13 years, on the street outside a deli near Princeton. House ignores the team's call. He thinks Wilson walked without his coat in the cold to punish himself. The schizophrenia started when he was in college, Wilson says of his brother. His brother called every day and talked for hours. Wilson didn't have hours. He was tired of being the guy everyone counted on. One night Danny called and Wilson had to study. So he hung up and went to the library.His mom called the next day. Danny had run away and left his meds behind.House suddenly understands where Wilson's people-pleasing talents came from. Danny over-reacted, too, House says, and then pauses in that House-ian way. It has to do with glucose. He calls the team.Nick has a complicated-sounding syndrome no mere mortal can spell. But it involves a fibroma that can be removed. All will be well.Nick, better now, packs up his things. He apologizes to Taub for, you know, the things he said. Taub asks him if he really thinks his nose is too big, and Nick kindly replies, \"It suits your face.\"Nick's wife arrives. She has good news. She's been offered a better job as a coordinator. Nick congratulates her with a sincerity that might not be doubted if he hadn't just spent the last few days speaking his mind. She doesn't seem to buy it.Wilson follows House out. Wilson will be seeing his brother next week. He wants House to meet him. House agrees.\nWilson says he thought seeing his brother would be either terrible or wonderful, but in reality, the two are simply strangers. He called the visit \"anti-climatic.\"\n\"Which is better than terrible,\" House says.House asks Wilson if he minds they have no social contract. Not really, Wilson says using a lot of words to say he appreciates House's forthrightness.\"It is kind of fun, watching you torture yourself,\" House says.", "episode_13": "We opened in a classroom where a kid named Johnny (Andy Scott Harris) was having trouble concentrating, but it's never the first kid. The teacher talked Johnny through his issues when another girl wet herself after Johnny spilled green glitter all over her snow drawing. Apparently, it's no longer the second kid, either. The teacher started coughing blood all over the girl and then passed out.Cue: Most awesome theme music.House (Hugh Laurie) arrived at the hospital to find Cameron (Jennifer Morrison) had taken over some of Cuddy's duties -- like babysitting House -- so the big boss could spend more time with her kid. Cameron gave House the file on the 29-year-old teacher.\u00a0\"Good. Fun. You get to exercise your new-found power, I squirm under your thumb, resent the student became the teacher. Then push comes to shove and we all get to realize what our real roles should be -- and then you put out,\" House said, taking a bite of his bagel.\u00a0\"That's why I took the job,\" Cameron replied, handing him the file as neither of them said anything more. Cameron saunters away, House looks amused.Foreman (Omar Epps) smirked at House taking orders from Cameron. He predicted Cameron would destroy House.\u00a0House poked fun at Thirteen (Olivia Wilde)\nand Foreman for disagreeing on the diagnosis for the patient, saying it was a smokescreen to cover up for the fact Foreman had \"boldly gone where no man has gone before.\" Foreman admitted they were seeing each other and it shouldn't matter.Thirteen and Kutner (Kal Penn) began treating the teacher, who talked a lot about finding her happy place. Her answers were a little too detailed and cheery for her own good. Kutner told her, \"If you ever meet our boss, just 'yes' or 'no' answers, OK?\"Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) visited Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein), who was taking care of her new baby. She started crying for no reason and said she didn't \"feel anything at all.\" Wilson expressed concern, but Cuddy said she wasn't neglecting the baby.House went to Cameron and told her he wanted to hit his patient with radiation, which the other doctors thought would be \"premature, reckless and potentially lethal.\" She said, \"Fine.\" House was surprised she gave in so easily. She said if he made a request that medically necessary, she'd approve. He then asked for oral sex, saying it was medically necessary. Cameron just wanted to return a phone call, poor House.House went back to the doctors to ask what he could do to avoid doing the radiation treatment, because he didn't intend to do it in the first place (because it's\u00a0\"premature, reckless and potentially lethal\"). He just wanted to get Cameron's power trip out of the way and she didn't fall for it. Thirteen suggested they go through all the steps to make it seem like they ran the test, but not actually run it.\u00a0Foreman told Chase (Jesse Spencer) that Thirteen was getting the placebo in the Huntington's clinical trial -- which was a 50 percent probability -- and he wanted to give her the real drug. Chase told him it was completely unethical and Foreman was trying to justify it to himself.\u00a0While giving the teacher, Sarah (Erika Flores), her fake radiation, she got up from the bed and collapsed. \"She clearly doesn't need fake radiation,\" Taub (Peter Jacobson) said.House wanted to give Sarah a cold bath to test the theory her condition was caused by cold temperatures, and knew there was someone in charge who would let him do it. Cut to Cuddy walking into her office to ask Cameron why she allowed House's radiation treatment idea. Cameron said she had to say yes because she knew House wanted her to say no. She knew he was testing her. Cuddy told her not to get cute.House walked in and wanted to wait for Cuddy to leave before talking to Cameron about the patient. House suggested Cuddy was at the hospital dumping her baby because she secretly hated her baby. \"Can't trust that Wilson guy with anything,\" House told Cuddy. She was upset, but tried not to show it too much. House told Cuddy it's not a big deal, suggesting she give back the kid because the adoption wasn't formal. \"Thanks,\" Cuddy said. \"I'm just going to go drop her off at the pound.\" House has the grace to look a tad guilty and uncomfortable.Cameron made House do the cold test on some of Sarah's blood instead of letting him do the bath. Foreman told House that Cameron was playing him. Thirteen and Foreman did the test and Sarah's blood clumped, apparently confirming the theory. The bath was on.Foreman stepped into Cameron's office and asked, \"Got a sec?\" She only said, \"Don't be an idiot,\" and he walked out.\u00a0Sarah sat in the cold bath, and she and Kutner discussed their career choices Sarah tells them she wanted to be in physiology, but instead of going to room 214, she went to 241 and found special education. House does the thoughful-stare-into-the-distance thing. The cold bath doesn't work. \"I'm not surprised,\" House said. \"She obviously has brain damage. Seriously.\"House wanted to biopsy the patient's brain to test for muscular scolerosis, but Kutner wanted to test her pancreas instead, thinking it was a tumor. They have an argument in which House predicts Sarah's lungs will fail next. House and Kutner went to Cameron to settle the dispute and she told him to do an MRI to check the brain for plaques before doing the biopsy. House tried to pressure her into approving either the biopsy or the pancreas test. \"Do the MRI,\" she told him. He walked out.Cuddy went to Wilson's office, with her baby, and told him she didn't want to go home. She said she was wondering whether House was right about suggesting she give the baby back. She confided in Wilson she didn't know if she wanted to make sacrifices for the baby. \"I feel terrible,\" she said. \"I feel like a failure.\" Wilson didn't know what to say.The doctors found no plaques on Sarah's brain. House told Kutner to go ahead with the pancreas test. Foreman pulled House aside and wanted to ask him about \"Remy\" -- Thirteen. House knew he was the last person Foreman would ask for ethical advice so he must have gotten the answers he didnt want to hear from everyone else. Foreman claims he just respects House's opinions. (ha!)House asked him if the drug would cure her. Foreman said it would reduce symptoms. \"No cure, then\" House said. He asked Foreman whether another few years of Thirteen having reduced symptoms were worth him risking the rest of his life in medicine. Foreman said, \"No.\" House seemed to agree, but then said, \"unless you love her.\" Foreman turned around. \"If you love her, then you do stupid things,\" House said. Foreman left.Kutner, Thirteen and Taub were doing the pancreas test and Sarah's lungs started to fail. Kutner doesn't want to be the one to tell House he was correct. House wanted to cut off Sarah's skull to check her brain for infection. Cameron didn't let him do it.Foreman and Thirteen went to check Sarah's classroom and Thirteen told Foreman she wanted kids. She said she was starting to feel like it was an option.Wilson brought Cuddy a picture frame and told her the girl in the photo was one of those estimations of what her daughter would look like in 18 years. He gave her a whole spiel about how she'd teach that kid to ride a bike and give her lifelong advice. She said thanks, that it was \"sweet\", then Wilson admitted it was just the photo that came with the frame.House pressured Cameron into allowing him to cut open Sarah's skull and put electrodes on her brain. Cameron even goes to OR to assist. Kutner scuttled to a phone and called Cuddy, telling her about the operation. House was conducting the test when Kutner put Cuddy on the speaker phone in the operating room. Cuddy's baby was crying in the background as she was telling him to stop the test. That freaked out the patient a little and while Cuddy's baby cried into the phone, it was bothering the patient. Sarah calls it \"annoying\". House was trying to figure out why. Cuddy was panicking at the same time, shouting at the baby to tell her what she wanted. The baby stopped crying. The patient was stable, and Cuddy was, too.Nothing was wrong with Sarah's brain and Kutner wanted to remove her spleen next. House was still mulling over why Sarah was annoyed by the baby's crying.\u00a0Cuddy came to the hospital later, with the baby, telling House they made a connection. House held the baby and it puked on him. Cuddy laughed. House went on a mini-rant about how we've evolved to find baby puke cute, \"because otherwise we'd kill them all before they become functional.\" Then he had his epiphany. \"Bonding is over,\" he said. \"I've got to go see another baby.\"House went to Sarah's room and told Kutner her spleen was fine. House said her heart didn't form correctly, ultimately causing blood to flow away from the left side of her brain when she got stressed. The left side of the brain registers annoyance. When her blood pressure was low, during the brain test, she became annoyed with Cuddy's baby's crying.\u00a0House said he could fix her heart, but it was bad news for the special education kids she helps, because she wouldn't be quite as patient anymore.\u00a0Cuddy told Cameron she did great work and should have trusted her instincts. Cameron quit. She was down on herself for approving an insane procedure with no proof or evidence. Cuddy tried to assure her she made the right decision. Cameron admitted she'd always say yes to House, and anyone else would always say no to him. \"Which leaves me\", says Lisa (hey, they called her by her name more times than ever in the series in this one episode.) Cuddy knew she had to get back to work.During a montage, Sarah was visited by her student, Johnny, who accidentally knocked a cup over and onto her her lap. She didn't get annoyed, though. She just hugged him as House looked on. Foreman switched the patient label onThirteen's IV bag, and Cuddy left her baby with a sitter as she rushed off to the hospital. The baby began crying as Cuddy left, she paused and looked like she wanted to cry, too. Then she left.", "episode_2": "We opened on more than one possible patient for this week's \"House\" medical mystery as four different people -- a tennis player, a crane operator, an ultimate fighter and a tuba player -- collapsed. Thirteen (Olivia Wilde) then barged into a lecture hall and announced, \"Class is over.\" She went to the teacher and confirmed she'd had a corneal transplant five years earlier. Thirteen told her all transplant patients from that particular donor had either died or were dying.\"I feel fine,\" the woman told Thirteen.\"I don't mean to scare you,\" Thirteen said, \"but so did the others.\"Cue: totally awesome theme music.Foreman (Omar Epps) led the team discussion about the patients, who died from something other than the organ they'd received from the donor. House's first question, \"What did Wilson do for me?\" No one responded.\"Sure, he made me laugh on a rainy day,\" House continued. \"Made me see the colors I never knew.\" He continued talking about Wilson as the team ignored him and kept discussing the patient. Foreman said it's not cancer.\"It's cancer,\" House replied.At lunchtime, House had another doctor, Dr. O'Shea (Tim Conlon), pay for his lunch and started chatting him up about monster trucks. He was looking for a new friend. Foreman came over to tell House the patient's right eye was failing and it needed to be removed. House told him not to remove the eye, the problem was in her head.\"Do you have some ethical problem with what I'm doing that you could express in a unique way that would actually make me think that I'm wrong even though I'll never admit it?\" House asked Dr. O'Shea, pretty much summing up Wilson's role in House's life.House ran the patient through an eye test, which she failed without squinting. He knew that meant the problem wasn't in her eye because her brain was thinking the eye was seeing correctly. She then hallucinated that House said he'd have to cut off her whole head, and her vision of him raised a cleaver and swung at her neck. House, giddy at having proven Foreman wrong, said, \"Hallucinations. That's a head thing, right?\"The group watched video of the ultimate fighter guy who died to look for clues tying all the patients together. When Taub (Peter Jacobson) made a suggestion, the coffee repairman piped in and called him an idiot. He kept going before he admitted he wasn't very good at disguises. House hired him with not much further explanation. The guy kept chiming in with bits of laughter he pretended were sneezes. The guy was a private investigator, Lucas (Michael Weston), who had all kinds of information on all the patients and charged House $2,300 for it.House wanted to biopsy the woman's brain, but Foreman and Taub objected. House went along with the objection and asked them to get an older patient's wife to agree to let them biopsy his brain. She said no. She and the corneal transplant patient then go into an argument about whose life was worth saving before her husband went into cardiac arrest. He died. \"Save the brain,\" House told Taub. \"Don't need consent for an autopsy.\"The brain was clean. House was back to his cancer theory. \"You need it to be cancer so you can have an excuse to talk to Wilson,\" Foreman told him. Kutner (Kal Penn) had a theory involving bacteria which got into the blood stream of the donor and something about a tear in the bowel wall, which might have gotten through to the transplant patients. House ordered a colonoscopy on the donor's 4-year-old daughter to see if she had similar symptoms.House was holed up with Lucas and discovered he thought House wanted him to be checking out Wilson. He told House he wanted to know if there was something that could make Wilson come back. \"Is there?\" House asked. \"No, there isn't,\" Lucas said, then asked for $900.Back at the hospital, the colonoscopy on the kid turned up nothing, but Kutner's theory maintained the opening in the bowel wall would happen shortly before death. But House said there's no way of knowing when that would be. Kutner suggested they perform a colonoscopy on the dead guy to see if he had the bowel wall tear. House gave the green light despite Foreman's objection.As Kutner and Foreman pushed pressure through the dead guy's cavities to get the scope where it needed to go, Foreman told Kutner to be careful. Would ya believe Kutner increased the pressure too much and the guy basically exploded, splattering what Foreman called \"bodily sewage\" all over him. Believe it.House told everyone to stop repeating ideas they'd already dismissed, then he left to start treatment for cancer. He had the patient sign a release to start chemo, but told her it might be a placebo effect. She started telling him about her life, saying she was an architect before she got her vision fixed, then she became a math teacher. She said the world didn't get any better, despite all the promises, then told House he was basically the same as she was. She told him his world wouldn't get any different if his leg was better.House met with Lucas again to find out what he knew about Wilson. He found out Wilson had been attending grief counseling, getting visits from Cameron (Jennifer Morrison) and Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein). He said Wilson had never mentioned House.Back at the hospital, the patient was responding to the chemo, but House decided it wasn't cancer. He said whatever she had was acting like cancer, but wasn't. He finally decided to knock on Wilson's door and tell him he needed his help. Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) asked House to leave, but he wouldn't. Wilson started to close the door on House, who blocked it. \"Please don't do this,\" Wilson said. House admitted he'd hired an investigator to follow Wilson and asked why he'd been talking to Cameron, Cuddy and Foreman.\"The next time you knock, I'm not answering,\" Wilson told him. Then he shut the door in House's face.House had an epiphany and realized cancer stem cells from the original donor had partially differentiated inside the transplant patients. Inside the patients, they mutated to look as if they belonged, attaching to the heart, lung and brain of the patients. House said this would cause everything to show up normal in X-rays, but he'd have to cut open her head to see her brain. She refused and insisted on continuing chemo. He said the chemo wasn't killing anything, just hiding the real problem.\"She's going to crash,\" he said. \"If we wait until she does, then it would be too late.\"Cuddy asked if the next step was her saying no and House doing something to make the patient crash so he could prove his theory right.\"I would never do that,\" he told her.\"No,\" she said. \"You won't.\"The next time House went to the patient's room, he found two security guards standing watch and didn't even try to get by them.House sat in a hallway, sulking just a little before dialing up Lucas, who posed as a nurse and went into the patient's room, adjusted her IV and caused her to crash.In the next scene, Chase (Jesse Spencer) and another surgeon were slicing her head open. House then admitted he was somehow able to switch her meds. Lucas wanted to stop the surgery, but House told him the dangerous part was already over. The surgeons saw something in her brain and they got it.House went to the patient's room after her surgery and told her the world is not as ugly as she thought it was. He took the gauze off her eyes and she turned to look at him.\"How do I look?\" he asked her.\"You look sad,\" she said.Later, House sat alone and made a phone call, asking, \"Is there any way I could put you on retainer?\"MEDICAL REVIEW :Apple (Felicia Day), a young high school math teacher, is one of six patients who received transplanted organs from the same donor. In the past eight months, four of these patients have died suddenly and one is hovering near death though all from different causes. Apple is the only one still alive. She is admitted to the hospital so the common cause of these deaths can be found, and in Apples case, prevented.A donor infection that slipped by screening is suggested, but discarded. Autoimmune disease, vasculitis (specifically Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein Purpura) and cancer are also suggested as possible diagnoses. House focuses on the cancer diagnosis. However, when he goes to talk with Apple, she starts to hallucinate.This neurological symptom makes him wonder if the common cause of the deaths might be a neurological disease instead of cancer. One of the dead patients was a mixed martial artist, and House suspects that he was showing neurological symptoms (a temporal lobe seizure) right before he died. This would lend credence to his neurological-cause theory. A brain biopsy would give the best information, but brain biopsies are risky, so therefore House decides it would be best to biopsy Frank the nearly dead patient. In the midst of trying to obtain consent from his wife, Frank suffers a respiratory arrest, then a cardiac arrest, and dies. A brain biopsy performed at autopsy is negative, so House goes back to his cancer diagnosis.Kutner counters with some nonsensical suggestion that it might be an intestinal perforation. He postulates that normal intestinal bacteria got into the bloodstream though an abnormal blood vessel in the intestine. Then, once into the bloodstream, these bacteria would affect other organs, and this is what caused the problems in all the patients. It sounds at first as if he is suggesting a blood borne infection that slipped by screening, but if thats the case, it wouldnt explain the Apple since (as Thirteen pointed out earlier in the show), the corneal transplant was bloodless (and corneas have no blood vessels). Then theres a suggestion this intestinal flaw is hereditary, and the team goes as far as giving the organ donors illegitimate four-year old daughter a colonoscopy (which is negative). Even if it is hereditary, how does it affect the transplant patients? Did their transplants somehow affect their intestines? This entire train of thought and how it was handled was well ludicrous is far too kind a word.Apple now develops a rapid heart rate, difficulty breathing, but her colonoscopy(!) remains normal. Multiple sclerosis is suggested but then quickly discarded. House is back to thinking its cancer, so he starts her on chemotherapy. Apple starts to improve; her heart and lungs return to normal (as do her previously unmentioned amylase and lipase, two pancreatic enzymes). But now House is back to thinking it isnt cancer because he has discovered that Frank was on methrotrexate, a drug that is used to treat some cancers. Since Frank died anyway, House decides it must not be cancer.House tries to talk with Wilson so he can have one of his usual last minute epiphanies, but Wilson slams the door in his face. Commiserating afterward with the private eye he hired to spy on Wilson, he finally has his flash of insight. He decides the organ donor had cancer stem cells. These spread out from the transplanted organs through the transplant patients bloodstreams and then differentiated into abnormal cells in various organs. Not cancer cells, per se, but non-functioning cells so the affected organs became weakened and suddenly failed. He believes Apple has these cells in her brain and wants to perform brain surgery on her. (House believes the cells are in her brain because even though she had a corneal transplant, she still thinks the world look ugly. House suspects her eyes are seeing correctly, but the brain is interpreting the results wrong.) Cuddy says no, but House is able with the help of his new private eye assistant to make it look as though Apple is sicker than she is and brain surgery is her only hope. The surgery is carried out, and sure enough, House is right. The abnormal brain tissue is removed and Apple is once again healthy and able to see well.", "episode_16": "We opened on a doctor (Fred Kronenberg) telling a couple their baby could \"have a completely normal and healthy life\" despite having both male and female genitalia. He told the couple they had a choice as to whether the kid would be a boy or a girl. Some years in the future, we see their boy, Jackson (Dominic Scott Kay), playing a school basketball game. After making the winning shot, he clutched his stomach and collapsed on the gym floor.Foreman (Omar Epps) and Thirteen (Olivia Wilde) were getting ready for the day together and still thinking about how they were going to avoid having House (Hugh Laurie) figure out they were still together. House, meanwhile, asked Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) if he was going to finish his bagel before taking it.\"Did you just ask my permission before you took my food?\" Wilson said.\"Yes we can,\" House said.Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) gave House the case of the boy who could have been a girl. \"Fun,\" House said.Then she told him the parents wanted assurance he wouldn't divulge that truth to the kid. \"Less fun, but still...\" he said, before taking the file. Cuddy was surprised at how easy that was.The doctors went over the case and discovered Jackson's parents had been telling the boy his testosterone meds were vitamins. Foreman then mocked an idea Thirteen had about the kid possibly having a \"blind uterus.\" She wanted to do an MRI. House ordered some other tests, including one putting a camera up the boy's penis. Then the parents walked in and posed the blind uterus idea and suggested an MRI. They said they have done a lot of research on their son's condition. House agreed and told Kutner (Kal Penn) it was easier than arguing with them.While testing the kid, Taub (Peter Jacobson) asked Thirteen how long the post-break-up awkwardness with Foreman would last. She said they were both professionals. Taub said he never understood what she saw in Foreman. Taub made fun of Foreman's lack of emotion, then he told Thirteen that House did her a favor by splitting them up. Also, the kid didn't have a blind uterus.Kutner told Wilson he thought there was something wrong with House because of his new-found lack of confrontation. Wilson wondered if House had a great cup of coffee or \"a tremendous bowel movement.\" He told Kutner to stop analyzing and enjoy House's good mood.While Taub did the penis-camera test on Jackson, his chest became tight and he said he couldn't breathe. His heart was filling with fluid and Thirteen stuck a syringe into his chest to drain it.Wilson went to Cuddy and said, \"You slept with House.\" He thought that explained House's good mood. She said she didn't. If she did, she would be curled up in a corner ashamed. Wilson was still suspicious.Thirteen discussed stopping the testosterone treatments for the boy with the parents and they didn't like the idea. She said they could take the opportunity to tell their child the truth, but they told her to tell the kid the testosterone blocker \"is something else.\"House had a clinic patient who said his arms and legs hurt when he put pressure on them. He poked himself and said, \"Oww,\" every time. House bent the guy's finger back and that also hurt. We next saw the guy walking out of the room with his finger in a splint, telling House, \"Thanks, bro.\"Thirteen was treating the boy when he revealed that he didn't really like basketball and his mom \"flipped out\" when he wanted to take dance. He said his dad seemed OK with it, but his mom didn't want him taking dance.Kutner told Foreman it was probably better he and Thirteen broke up because of \"the whole bisexual thing.\" Foreman said it was never an issue.Cuddy and Wilson went into House's office to confront him about his good mood, but he was sleeping. Then they realized he wasn't breathing. They revived him, then Cuddy asked, \"What the hell is going on?\"Cuddy was testing House and he said, \"I think my penis stopped breathing. Do you know CPR?\"\"Looks like the brain is working fine,\" she said.He wanted information about the patient and insisted his situation was caused by taking too much Vicodin. Then Kutner and Wilson both said they didn't remember seeing House take any Vicodin that day or the previous day.House left the office and Wilson suggested he was on heroin. \"Whatever he's taking,\" Wilson said, \"it's stronger than Vicodin.\"Foreman and Thirteen searched the boy's house and Foreman asked if she missed sleeping with women. She said, \"Yes.\" She said she also missed sleeping with other men and he probably missed sleeping with other women. She asked why it was coming up now. He told her about what Kutner said. Thirteen remembered Taub making fun of Foreman. They wondered if it was a coincidence or if the other doctors were just messing with them. They decided if Kutner and Taub knew, then House probably knew. Foreman said that was good, because it meant House chose to jerk them around rather than fire them.Thirteen found a poem written by the kid, about being alone beneath a mask. As she read it to House, he pretended to be asleep. She decided the poem meant the kid could be suicidal. During the discussion, Foreman touched Thirteen's shoulder and said it was \"sweet\" she was worried about House. House and Kutner both noticed that move.Thirteen showed Jackson's parents the poem, which made his dad think telling him the truth might help him. The mother resisted, saying \"every teenager feels different.\" She didn't think it was the right time to spring the news on him. She also asked Thirteen to restart the testosterone.Foreman confronted Kutner and Taub about messing with him and Thirteen, which led to Kutner and Taub settling their bet. Kutner figured it out because Foreman smelled like Thirteen's soap every morning. Then Foreman wondered why, if Kutner had figured it out, House hadn't figured it out.Foreman then called Wilson and said he thought House was on heroin. Wilson had answered the phone while having dinner with House. Wilson wanted to toast with bourbon shots and House didn't drink it. House knew Wilson was suspicious House was on something stronger -- he figured it out because of the drink.House said he knew if he was on heroin he couldn't drink the bourbon \"without risking another bout of not breathing.\"\"Well?\" Wilson asked. House took the drink, then left.Back at the hospital, Thirteen told Jackson \"these aren't vitamins\" when he said the injection looked like the vitamins his parents give him. He asked what it was, but she said she couldn't tell him. \"You should ask your parents,\" Thirteen said.Back outside the the restaurant, Wilson caught House forcing himself to throw up. House said he wasn't on heroin, he was on methadone -- \"Stupid product,\" he said. \"Heroin without the high.\" Wilson said it had twice the risk of death. \"But no risk of arrest,\" House said.House told Wilson he wasn't detoxing. House said \"it doesn't help with my pain, it eliminates it.\" He threw his cane in a dumpster and walked away, saying, \"My leg doesn't hurt anymore.\"Jackson's parents wanted Thirteen taken off the case for violating their instructions. The dad wanted to \"deal with Jackson\" because the questions weren't going to go away. She said he wasn't ready, and the dad said, \"Let's hope you're wrong.\" Cuddy told Thirteen to be available for the kid because she was the only person he was going to trust.Jackson's dad told him he was \"just a little different.\" He wondered why they never told him, why they lied. He told them to leave him alone.Cuddy confronted House about the methadone. He said it was legal and he had a prescription. She worried that if he kept taking it he could die. She told him, as long as he was in her hospital, he couldn't do methadone. \"I'll send someone for my stuff,\" he said.He said he would choose \"lack of pain over this job.\"Jackson worried that he was supposed to be a girl, telling Thirteen he really likes hanging out with a boy on his basketball team. He wondered if he was supposed to be a girl because he liked dance more than basketball. She handed him the poem about hiding behind a mask, telling him \"no matter how bad things get, killing yourself is never the answer.\" He said it was just an English assignment and he hadn't had those kinds of thoughts. \"I'm sad sometimes, but I don't want to die,\" he said. \"At least, I didn't.\" Thirteen panicked. Then the kid threw up blood.Back at home, House shaved.Foreman told the doctors they were on their own. He said Cuddy didn't say why House wasn't there, he was just gone. Thirteen pushed for a diagnosis that wasn't fatal and Foreman asked her why. He knew she thought she'd ruined the boy's family. She was afraid she \"started a fire and threw gas on it.\"Wilson went to House's place and discovered he'd hired a hooker to watch him sleep. House was all cleaned up and putting on a suit. He was going to a meeting at another hospital to try to convince them to start a diagnostics department. Wilson was amazed House owned a tie, actually two.Jackson's parents got the news from Taub the doctors thought their child has scleroderma, which was fatal. The mother confronted Thirteen about ruining things. Cuddy came and told the mother to go be with her child. Thirteen thanked Cuddy for intervening, but Cuddy said, \"I didn't do it for you.\"Wilson told Cuddy they made a mistake with House, saying the methadone was good for House. He said House was their friend and \"this is his one chance to not be miserable.\"Jackson's mom went to his bed side. They waited in silence.Back at Thirteen's place, she and Foreman were discussing Jackson's response to the treatment. They realized his kidney function meant he didn't have scleroderma.A spiffy looking and cleaned up House went to Cuddy for a recommendation letter and she handed him a list of requirements for his methadone treatment. She gave him his job back and he agreed to the methadone treatment conditions. He thanked her.House went back to his office to catch up on the case. Thirteen and Foreman came in talking about their new theory. House asked when they came up with that, and Thirteen said they met in the lobby. House asked what they'd ruled out. As soon as Taub said they'd ruled out dehydration, House became concerned. He asked if the kid liked energy drinks, then left to the patient's room.House called the parents idiots and said their son simply had dehydration. He said the energy drinks put a strain on his kidneys, which made them need more time to rebound. He wasn't better because House let the parents talk him into that MRI for the blind uterus before they could give the kid more water.\"My team injects him with contrast material,\" House said. He said the contrast material would have been processed by healthy kidneys in a couple of hours. Instead, it traveled through his system, \"getting in trouble everywhere it went.\" House said with a few weeks of dialysis he should be fine.\"You gave birth to a freak of nature,\" House told them. \"That doesn't mean it's a good idea to treat him like one.\"Thirteen talked to Jackson alone later, and he said his mom asked him if he wanted to take dance lessons. He was worried he might miss basketball. \"No reason you can't do both,\" Thirteen said.House sat in his office when Cuddy came in with his methadone treatment, but he said he was done. He was upset with himself for missing things during the case. \"I played nice because I was in a good mood because my leg didn't hurt,\" he told her.She said he didn't need pain to be a good doctor, but he said he wasn't interested in \"good.\"House asked her why it mattered to her whether he was happy. She said he was afraid of change, that he thinks the one thing he has is his intellect and if that's compromised he'd have nothing.He refused to take the methadone and threw it in the trash.\"This is the only me you get,\" he said, before walking out and turning off the lights.", "episode_10": "We opened on a fitness instructor filming a commercial in a stadium advocating a natural lifestyle. An obese guy, Irv (Brad Grunberg), collapses while climbing some stairs, but he wasn't going to be the patient. The first one who collapses is never the patient. The fitness instructor, after urging the big guy to run to the top of the stadium steps, collapsed and fell down several rows of bleachers.Cue: Awesome theme music.Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) told House (Hugh Laurie) there were fewer requests for him than usual, but at least there was this one interesting case. She told House she was going to be sharing offices with him after hers was destroyed during the hostage crisis last week.Taub (Peter Jacobson) and Kutner (Kal Penn) were the only docs around for House to confer with on the patient because Foreman (Omar Epps) and Thirteen (Olivia Wilde) were working on the Huntington's clinical trial -- Foreman as the doctor, Thirteen as a patient. Cuddy, in the adjacent office, kept interfering with the differential.Thirteen sat in a lobby area and watched a Huntington's patient suffering through the physical burdens of Huntington's. This prompted a flashback of her mom (Danielle Petty) suffering the same symptoms and her dad (Christopher Stapleton) telling her it would be OK, while shutting the door to block her mother from her view.Taub and Kutner put the fitness instructor through an exercise to try to re-create the circumstances prompting her initial collapse. She said she felt find, and then collapsed.Thirteen did a test for Foreman after which he concluded her nerves have started degenerating.Back in the office, House proposed to Cuddy they split the desk in half. Kutner divulged to Taub he'd set up a \"second-opinion clinic\" online where people e-mail their symptoms to him and he tells them what he thinks of their conditions. He said he was running the site under House's name and Taub blackmailed him into giving him a 30 percent cut or he'd tell House. Then they discovered, while looking at images of the fitness instructor's stomach, she'd had her stomach stapled.Cuddy and House's playful office tension reached a new level when House tried to annoy Cuddy to get her to leave his office.Taub mocked the patient for \"cheating\" and getting gastric bypass surgery to get her figure while telling other people they can work hard enough to get where she has.Kutner was having a problem with one of his online patients. The patient, a woman whose breast implant burst, wanted Kutner to figure out what was causing her chronic fatigue or she'd complain to the licensing board. Taub and Kutner had to stay overnight to run a sleep apnea test on the patient and when she flat lined they discovered she wasn't in her bed. They found her on a treadmill, running on her broken ankle. Her leg was bleeding and she didn't feel Taub poking her in the leg with a needle.Cuddy spilled hydrogen sulfide in the office she and House were sharing, then left for the night. Thirteen rejoined the team while Foreman went back to work on his Huntington's trial. She told Foreman she'd come by later for treatment.The fitness instructor, Emmy (Samantha Shelton), told Taub she knew she was a hypocrite, but asked if he'd ever done anything hypocritical and whether he thought he had a good reason. He didn't respond.Taub and Kutner rode in the elevator with a tattooed woman who said she'd been e-mailing with House about her breast implants. She wanted to talk to House. They stopped her and put her on antibiotics, hoping she'd be better in the morning. Thirteen came home to find Foreman waiting there. He asked why she'd followed his instructions but didn't show up for treatment. She said she didn't want a visual reminder of what was going to happen to her every time she went to his trial. He told her to show up the next day, on time, or not show up at all. She had a quick flash of her dad knocking on her door saying, \"Your mom's leaving. You're going to regret this for the rest of your life.\"While discussing the patient, Kutner and Taub received pages one right after the other. They decided to treat the fitness instructor for Guillain-Barre syndrome, which leads to paralysis and starts with weakness in muscles and limbs. Kutner's online patient, DeeDee (Becky Baeling), was down in the ER singing \"Put the Lime in the Coconut\" into her nurse call button. Cameron (Jennifer Morrison) noticed she was bleeding from her ear and told them to get House.Kutner, Chase (Jesse Spencer) and Cameron talked about the singing patient over lunch. They tried to convince Kutner to tell House, but he refused. Kutner came up with an idea and Chase said he'd do the test, in exchange for 25 percent of Kutner's income.The fitness instructor had a hallucination in which her clients converged on her in her hospital room and said they knew she'd lied about her gastric bypass. She woke up shouting, \"Get off of me!\" The doctors decided her hallucinations ruled out Guillain-Barre.House and Cuddy exchanged some flirtatious banter and asked each other, \"Are you screwing with me?\" Cuddy said everyone knew they were headed somewhere and said they'd reached the part where they were supposed to kiss. Instead, House touched her breast, saying they'd already kissed, so that would be the logical next step. \"I'm an idiot for being surprised,\" Cuddy said before leaving.Thirteen showed up for treatment and saw the woman from earlier in the episode sitting in the waiting room who was making random, sudden movements, unable to control herself because of the Huntington's. She asked Foreman if he could change her appointment time, but he said he couldn't. Thirteen had a flash of watching from her bedroom window as her mom sat in a car, ready to leave, making the same involuntary movements. Thirteen walked over to Janice (Lori Petty), the patient in the waiting room, and helped her put a sweater on.Emmy told Taub she wanted chocolate cake, but he told her not to give up. She asked what else her disease could be other than a brain tumor. He told her Prion disease, and wheeled her away.Taub asked House about the patient, but House wanted to know how Taub felt when he was \"philandering with impunity.\" Taub said he \"loved it,\" superficially, but thought he was miserable deep down. Taub set off to get Cuddy's approval to do the brain biopsy, but House said he'd do the biopsy himself. They went into Emmy's room and found her stretching. \"I thought you said she was sick,\" House told Taub.House wondered how Emmy suddenly was no longer sick. Taub said he took Emmy to the cafeteria to get some chocolate cake and took her to her room. \"You gave her cake?\" House asked. \"She asked for it,\" Taub said.House went to Emmy's room with a chocolate cake. He explained her illness was hereditary coproporphyria which makes her unable to produce an enzyme important for her \"liver and everything else.\" The treatment is a high-carb diet, rich in sugar, House explained. \"When you were a porker, you were self-medicating,\" he said. Taub said they'd have to reverse her gastric bypass and get her back on a high-carb, sugar-rich diet. Rejecting House's offer of cake, Emmy instead wanted to try a drug managing the symptoms but wasn't a cure. Taub realized being pretty was more important to Emmy than being healthy.Kutner went to the ER to check on his singing patient, but a nurse told him she coded and they tried to save her, but they couldn't.Cuddy went into her newly redone office to find her desk from med school inside. She smiled when she realized House got it for her.Thirteen told Foreman she wasn't freaked about her future when she saw the Huntington's patients in the waiting room; she was freaked out about her past. She said she wanted her mother to die, because at the time her mother screamed so much and even though her father said she didn't mean it. Thirteen lamented she didn't have a chance to say goodbye to her mother, \"and she died with me hating her.\" Thirteen then bursts into tears. Foreman and Thirteen embrace.Kutner and Taub saw their online patient in the morgue and worried that House was going to kill them. \"Slowly ... and painfully,\" House said, sneaking in behind them. He yelled at Kutner for being so stupid to start the site in the first place, and at Taub for not ratting him out while the patient was still alive. House said what she had was easily treatable. He said it might still be possible to save her. He climbed on top of her and pressed on her chest a couple of times before she took a huge breath, sending Kutner and Taub into a screaming fit as they jumped backward.He explained the woman was untrained, \"at least, not in acting.\" House said the CT scan was hard to find, but was from a patient three years ago. \"The hair, makeup, and getting Chase and Cameron to play along was much easier,\" he added. Kutner said he'd take down the Web site, but House told him to keep it going, as long as he gets 50 percent for letting Kutner use his name.Cuddy walked happily toward House's office, where she saw him standing and chatting with the woman he used to trick Kutner and Taub. She looked dejected and walked away.", "episode_11": "It was all about the Christmas spirit on \"House\" as we opened on a school choir singing, \"Joy to the World.\" A couple of unruly teenage girls were looking to shake things up with their performance and tried to convince an awkward girl to join in by singing lyrics calling their teacher \"stupid.\" She did it, but no one else did. Then she got dizzy and threw up.As the team discussed the case, Taub (Peter Jacobson) had a Christmas gift with a card reading, \"Greg, made me think of you.\" House threw it away. House threw it in the trash, but Taub took it out and unwrapped it. It was \"Manual of the Operations of Surgery,\" by Joseph Bell. House threw it away -- again.Chase (Jesse Spencer) got the girl's friends from school to admit they'd given her mushrooms. Thirteen (Olivia Wilde) was undergoing an experimental Huntington's treatment with Foreman (Omar Epps), who told her the woman she'd seen in previous weeks had dropped out of the program. When she left, she'd slipped Foreman a gift certificate to a day spa as a Christmas gift. Taub and Kutner (Kal Penn) found a big bottle of painkillers in the girl's school locker. The girl told Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) she wasn't trying to kill herself but wondered what the point was of getting better because all the kids in school hated her and were mean to her.Taub and Kutner were wondering what was happening with the book House received. They went to Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) to see if he knew anything about it. Wilson guessed the wrapping paper was green. He messed with them a bit before admitting he'd given House the book in green wrapping paper last Christmas. The girl, Natalie (B.K. Cannon), had a quick emergency. \"I guess this means she didn't try to kill herself,\" Kutner said.Cuddy continued to linger as House and his crew tried to figure out what was happening with Natalie. Taub pressed House on Cuddy, saying he thought she gave him the book as a present and said House should just tell Cuddy he loves her. Thirteen and Kutner giggled and House realized they'd talked to Wilson and knew the truth. House got mad at Wilson, who wondered why House would try to mess with his team by giving himself a fake present. House seemed to see the light and decided he should \"stop being such a jerk.\" Then he took Wilson's ice cream sandwich and said, \"Guess I undercut myself there.\"Suddenly, House showed up to work clinic duty on a day he wasn't assigned, and was being extra nice to his patients. He came upon a woman who he thought was pregnant but she insisted she was a virgin, as was her fianc\u00e9. Natalie then went into some kind of seizure in another room, with Cuddy watching her.Liver, lungs and now Natalie's brain made House's white board. He also noticed Cuddy had reappeared. House wondered if the patient was reminding Cuddy of the girl whose baby she tried to adopt. Thirteen, whose first name we now know is Remy, told Foreman she talked to Janice (Lori Petty), the woman she'd met before, and told him he should apologize for telling Janice to \"deal with it\" when the medication was making her nauseous. Thirteen told Foreman he was being House.The pregnant woman came back to the hospital and asked House to tell her fianc\u00e9 she could've gotten pregnant without having sex. House told the man she'd probably cheated on him.Natalie seemed in a cheerful mood and she told Kutner her friend Simon (Lucas Till), who'd supplied the girls with the mushrooms, brought her homework for her. Kutner called security and demanded Simon tell him why he came to visit Natalie. He must have felt guilty about something. Kutner threatened to call the cops. Taub pulled him aside to say just how unreasonable Kutner was being. They tried again, more calm this time. Simon admitted he used to be friends with Natalie and said he used to supply her with a few bottles of vodka each week.Natalie told Cuddy she hadn't drunk in six months. She claimed she didn't drink most of the vodka Simon bought her. Meanwhile, in the clinic, House was finding it tough to be extra nice to patients after a woman said her asthma was still bothering her despite the fact she was spraying her inhaler onto her neck rather than inhaling.The pregnant couple returned. House brought in some test results and looked surprised when he read them. He told them not to leave, and walked out. Foreman's partner in the Huntington's clinical trial, Dr. Schmidt (Phyllis Lyons), said the patients should be seen as numbers because introducing emotion could throw off the scientific study. House came back to the pregnant couple six hours later with the shocking result of their paternity test: the woman's pregnancy was the result of parthenogenesis -- an asexual form of reproduction never been proven possible in humans. He congratulated the couple and said in seven months they would witness a virgin birth.Natalie's latest symptoms suggested she might have leukemia, but House preferred more testing rather than treatment, which would have been painful. Cuddy had a particular attachment to this patient and seemed ready to fight for her. House told her \"some patients die.\" Then he noticed a gift on his desk from the pregnant couple and he explained to Cuddy he faked the parthenogenesis explanation as a way to save their relationship. In fact, the woman had cheated on the man. But it got him a gift from a patient, which meant House won his bet with Wilson. He took the gift over to Wilson's office, tossed it to him and said, \"I win!\"As he talked about the pregnant woman, Cuddy had a clarity moment usually reserved for Dr. House: The girl didn't have leukemia, she had eclampsia -- a complication of pregnancy.Cuddy explained to Natalie and her parents about the disease and said the girl could have contracted it up to a month after giving birth. Her parents didn't believe it, but Cuddy said Natalie could have covered it up with baggy clothes and the baby was probably born premature. Cuddy then realized the baby was the reason, why Natalie quit drinking and had asked her so often about whether she (Cuddy) had children. \"The baby is ... why you feel guilty,\" Cuddy told Natalie. She cried and explained Simon was the father and they were \"like boyfriend-girlfriend for a while,\" they just didn't tell anyone.Natalie explained she gave birth unexpectedly and she felt bad about being unable to save the baby herself, but she left it near a soup kitchen where she volunteered. Cuddy then explained the damage to Natalie's heart and liver were permanent, which meant she would die. Natalie cried as she said she didn't even bury the baby. She just put her coat over her.Cuddy went into a dark, seemingly abandoned building and ran into a couple squatting there. They'd found the baby and took care of her. Cuddy said they needed to give her up because they couldn't give her the care she needed. Cuddy returned to the hospital with the baby and handed her to Natalie. Simon arrived to visit and was stunned to see her holding a child. Kutner and Simon exchanged looks and one could get the feeling Kutner would tell Simon he was a father.Next scene: Kutner, grim faced, walking toward the front doors. The other doctors asked him if Natalie would get a transplant, and he told them the committee turned her down. She only has a couple of days to live. The doctors all lamented the fact the baby would likely end up with her father, who'd \"just been named captain of the high school bullying team,\" Taub said.Kutner left and went to an old high-school acquaintance's house and apologized for all the bad stuff he'd done to him in high school.House walked in on Cuddy standing over the baby. Cuddy said she'd spoken to both sets of grandparents and they said it was too painful to keep her and they were putting her up for adoption. \"I already spoke to a lawyer,\" she told House. \"I become a foster parent, and then I adopt.\"\"Merry Christmas, Cuddy,\" House said before walking out of the room, but first he gave a longing look back at the new mother and child.Foreman and Thirteen met up and Thirteen said she noticed Janice was back in the trial. \"That was my Christmas gift to you,\" Foreman said.Thirteen said she was wrong and told Foreman he's not like House. \"That was my Christmas gift to myself,\" he said.They agreed they should go down to the Christmas party, but instead they made out. That's right. Foreman and Thirteen kissed. And they kissed long and hard. That'll keep 'em warm for the Winter! (New \"House\" episodes are slated to return Jan. 19 in a new, 8 p.m. ET/PT Monday timeslot).", "episode_7": "We opened on a guy unconscious in his house, where paramedics broke down the door to get to him. Sounds were muffled and bright lights disturbed him. Once they wheeled him out of his house, he punched a paramedic and ran back inside, closing the door behind him and telling them to stay out of his house.Cue: awesome theme music.Cameron sighting! Cameron was in House's meeting room explaining the case. The 35-year-old man had had a crushing headache and three seizures in the past three days. He's also a severe agoraphobe. They could only treat him with what they could take to his house because he wouldn't leave. House assured Taub that Cameron wasn't trying to work her way back on the team after she explained that she runs a community outreach program and that was why she was the first to treat the patient at his home.Cuddy pulled House aside and handed him a bunch of take-out menus, hoping he could come up with a better explanation of what they were talking about when his team asked. She explained she was emotional and he was showing his human side the night before, and that was why they kissed. She thanked him for not taking advantage. When House came back into the room, Thirteen asked him what Cuddy wanted. \"I kinda hit that last night, so now she's all up on my jock,\" House said.The team tried to figure out what was causing the patient's seizures, and Cameron and the team eventually went to his house. He at first didn't want to let anyone in, but Cameron convinced him to let her treat him in one room while the other doctors searched the rest of his house for toxins. He tried to convince Cameron that he was happy living his life in his house. He worked from home, could see whatever he wanted online.House told Wilson he \"hit that\" with Cuddy. Wilson was blown away, but House explained it was just a kiss. House started messing with a mosquito bite on his hand.House called Cameron and the team to find out the guy's seizures all seemed to happen when he was in the hallway of his house, near the door. House figured he got spooked being close to the outside world. During their conversation, House sprinkled in questions to Cameron about her love life with Chase, and found out that they mostly stay at Chase's place, which House said sounded like \"control issues.\"Since they couldn't take the patient, Stewart, outside, House decided to bring the outside to him, inviting perfect strangers into the man's house that night. When House and the three strangers went into the man's room, he appeared to have another seizure, but his brain levels were normal and he said his stomach was killing him. \"It's something,\" House said.The doctors found a bowel obstruction, which caused the pain. They still couldn't explain the seizures. House tried to convince Stewart, to come to the hospital for potentially life-saving surgery, but he refused. He said he's rather die at home than live outside. House said he knew a surgeon who would operate in his house. House later explained to Cameron that even though they couldn't possible operate in his house, they could set it all up as if they were going to, put the guy under, take him to the hospital and bring him back home before he came to. \"We've got to make it look good,\" Cameron said. They set the plan in place, but before they put Stewart under, he held Cameron's hand and told her she was a \"good person.\" When Chase put him under, they rolled him out of the house.At the hospital, Wilson talked to Cuddy about her kiss with House. He asked Cuddy why she's never thought of House \"that way.\" She talked about how it would all be exciting at first, then would end badly. Chase and Cameron talked about their plans for the night and Cameron suggested they stay at her place, which Chase didn't really agree to right away. Cuddy stopped them as they rolled the patient to surgery. She demanded that the patient stay in the hospital for his post-op treatment.Before surgery and when no one was around, Cameron woke Stewart up to tell him they'd brought him to the hospital because she felt bad about what they'd done. He freaked out, pushed her away, and ripped something out of his chest, which started to squirt blood. Chase ran into the room and asked Cameron, \"What did you do?\"Stewart left the hospital and his lawyer threatened to sue. Cuddy kicked all the doctors off the case. Cameron told Chase she was still going to work on it, but Chase said there was no case, and continued to say they'd left House's team to get away from all the craziness. \"That's why I left House,\" she said. \"You got fired.\"Cameron went to Stewart's house and apologized through the door, saying she let everyone close to her down to help him. \"I won't let you down again,\" she promised. He opened the door. Wilson told House he was acting different toward Cuddy because he was scared to get involved. He was trying to get House to get involved with Cuddy. House put another band-aid on his hand. House told Wilson to stop trying to live vicariously through him.Cameron suggested they do the surgery in Stewart's house, which Taub and Kutner did while Stewart's lawyer looked on. The discovered signs of Whipple's Disease. A mishap with the cauterizer and the build up of gas in Stewart's intestine caused flames to shoot out of his belly, but House told the lawyer it happens all the time. Chase didn't want Cameron to stay the night at Stewart's house, but she was going to. Just then, Stewart shouted for her and said his legs were numb.The new symptom ruled out Whipple's so the doctors were left to keep brainstorming. House wanted to force-feed Stewart, which he hoped would cause him to come back to the hospital. Cameron preferred a blood test, which would be painless. Foreman made the call to do both tests.Wilson, meanwhile, told Cuddy that he'd always had feelings for her. She asked him on a date the next night, then she suggested they just have sex in front of House's office. She knew the point was to make House jealous so he'd realize he should be with Cuddy.Stewart explained to Cameron that he'd always been hesitant to go outside and his girlfriend was the reason he ever wanted to go out. \"Then she died,\" he said. House told Taub to give Stewart less morphine in order to make staying at home more painful for Stewart than going to the hospital would be. House told Taub he'd do it because his marriage was falling apart. Taub agreed to do it admitted his wife had him sleeping on the couch, but that it was only temporary.House had a bizarre dream that involved luring the mosquito in his apartment with a propane tank, swatting it, breaking off a hose, and then swatting at the stove in his kitchen, igniting a burner. His apartment then blew up, waking him from his dream. House went to Wilson's apartment. Wilson told House he was imagining his mosquito bite, which only seemed to bother him when he thought of Cuddy. Wilson kicked him out at 3 a.m., so House went to Stewart's.Stewart's heart stopped and House called his lawyer for permission to take him to the hospital. He got the OK just as Cameron shocked Stewart despite House's order to wait. She got a pulse, which meant they didn't have to take him in. House offered Cameron her old job back so he could fire her.House figured out that Stewart's OCD caused him to clean his tub often with bleach and ammonia, which created chlorine and was causing his stomach pain. Still, they weren't sure if his heart was OK and it was unlikely Stewart would let them take him to the hospital for surgery.Cameron asked Chase if he'd do it and he said no, as she knew he would. He knew she was thinking there was something wrong with their relationship, and he explained the reason they stay at his house was because he always felt like a visitor at hers. She always kicked him out in the morning and never cleared a drawer for him. He told her he understood being in a relationship was difficult because she'd lost her husband, \"but I can't keep chasing you forever.\"Cameron told House that Stewart was getting worse, including the stomach pain. She told House that she knew he'd take Stewart off morphine, so she switched his meds back from the saline that Taub had switched them to earlier. House said \"I love you, call me when you get done with puberty.....\" That's when House realized he was right -- Stewart was being poisoned. House went to his House, sliced open the area around Stewart's hip and pulled out shards of the hollow-point bullet the mugger used when he shot Stewart. The lead was dissolving and causing the pain.House then went on a rant about how Stewart was pathetic and lying about being happy living in his house. There were roses by his door when the paramedics came to get him and House knew that Stewart was going to put flowers on his dead girlfriend's grave for her birthday but couldn't leave the house. \"If you want to change your life, so something,\" House told Stewart. \"Don't believe your own rationalizations. Don't just lock yourself up and pretend you're happy.\"Cameron heard this and went to Chase, told him he was right about her husband's lasting effect on her. But she cleaned out a drawer for Chase, a nice big one.House was at home when a mosquito landed on his other hand. Instead of swatting it, he blew it away and got up and left. Meanwhile, a montage showed Chase at Cameron's, Stewart gearing up to leave his house, House on Cuddy's doorstep, and Taub's wife coming to hug him.Stewart made it out of his house, stepping outside and heading toward the street. But House, standing at Cuddy's doorstep and seeing her though her window, turned around and walked away.", "episode_20": "A family gathers around a dying man at his home, saying their good-byes.\nHe asks to be alone with his wife.

He thinks her heart is too big and his is too small, but Eddie cuts him off, asking if he's kidding.\nYes, he is. He thinks she's faking, thinking the sicker she was, the longer he'd hang on.

He removes his wedding ring and takes out shirts from the closet. His wife and son arrive at the house to find the shirts piled in a line across the front of the garage. Jeff is passed out in the car with the motor running. His wife frantically pulls him from the car.Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) gets to work late, stressed over an impending visit from the foster caseworker. She remarks to House (Hugh Laurie) that Cameron (Jennifer Morrison) did his department budgets for him.Cameron briefs the team on the case, asking House to take it on in repayment for her favor. Jeff's chronic pain is undiagnosed. Thirteen (Olivia Wilde) suggests fribromyalga. House orders Taub (Peter Jacobson) to take a pain profile.Thirteen and Foreman (Omar Epps) search through the patient's home, and they discuss their relationship. Thirteen does not want to pursue anything further with him. She pulls a clear plastic bag of frozen poultry out of the freezer, and thinks it is quail, which could have caused rhabdoymolysis.House considers this diagnosis and orders muscle biopsies on the patient. Taub protests Jeff does not have a toxic reaction, it's psychosomatic. House figures he can leave work early since Cuddy came in late.Thirteen and Kutner (Kal Penn) take deep-tissue samples with a large-bore biopsy needle. Jeff's wife does her best to comfort him as the son watches, hopeful. Suddenly, Jeff has an excruciating pain in his arm and he loses consciousness. Foreman calls House, who is in bed, ignoring the phone.Thirteen tells the team the VQ scan showed a pulmonary embolism. The desk phone rings, and Foreman takes the call from House. He is sitting on the edge of his bed, massaging his thigh with one hand while holding the phone with the other. Thirteen explains the hypercoagulable state could cause pain and a PE. Kutner suggests a cancer syndrome like Trousseaus would explain the blood clots, multi-focal pain, and lack of obvious physical signs. House tells them to check Jeff's chest, abdomen, and pelvis for tumors.House feels a drop of water fall on the back of his neck. He grabs a t-shirt from the bed, drapes it over the end of his cane, and reaches up to wipe the water off the ceiling. As he gently pushes on the ceiling with his cane it crashes down on him. House watches as a plumber checks the hole in his ceiling. He says the insurance deductible doesn't cover negligence. The pipe didn't burst. It was pulled apart from the shower.Taub views images on a monitor and Kutner mans the controls as Jeff undergoes a full-body CT scan. They discuss the act of suicide.Foreman tends to Thirteen during her drug trial. She insists they should not date. Kutner and Taub enter with the news there is no trace of cancer in the patient but they did find edema in his intestine. Air in the intestinal blood vessels would explain the pain. Kutner hands the file to Foreman and Thirteen. Foreman tells them to do an angioplasty on the superior mesenteric and find the other blockages before the patient suffers another cardiac arrest.House enters his office, still unkempt and aggravated. Foreman lets him know the CT showed intestinal edema and air in the blood vessels. House is skeptical. If it was vascular, we should've seen uneven pulses and he'd have hemorrhages in his fingers, he says.Jeff continues to struggle with the pain, as Thirteen is about to start the angioplasty. Everyone turns to see House and Foreman come in. House disconnects an IV tube from the three-way stopcock connecting Jeff's forearm to three different IV bags. There are teeth marks from when Jeff blew in his IV tube. Jeff insists he wants to die.House, Thirteen, Foreman, Taub and Kutner are gathered as Cuddy stands to change Joy's diaper in her nursery. Cuddy is annoyed they let this happen. Thirteen suggests the diagnosis of non-motor seizures. The pain started in his abdomen, near his intestine. Foreman offers up a glycogen storage disease, like McArdles, would explain the pain. Plus, theres plenty of muscle cells in the wall of his intestine. House says to run an ischemic forearm test.As Thirteen enters her drug trial, she sees Janice (Lori Petty), who's shaking a bit but looks much better and happier. Thirteen did not know their appointments were back-to-back again. Janice says that hers got switched that morning. Thirteen confronts Foreman about switching Janice's appointment time, which he denies.Kutner and Taub stick an IV tube into Jeff's arm, place a blood-pressure cuff extra-tightly on the same arm and hand him a tennis ball. He asks his family to leave him. Suddenly the arm pain jumps to his leg.House, still unkempt and in pain, types on a laptop as Taub and Kutner brief him. He needs the name of a good lawyer and asks Kutner who represented the hospital when he set that patient on fire. House types the name into the email he's composing.House asks Cuddy for permission on a procedure to see if the patient's pain is coming from his brain or his body. Cuddy's pager goes off. She glances at it, annoyed. She tells House to do whatever he thinks is right.Jeff is lying on one side, hooked up to monitors and IVs. Chase (Jesse Spencer) readies the lidocaine injection. A still-unshowered House enters to talk with Jeff about tolerating the pain. \"Take a look at your future\", Jeff says.Cuddy is in her messy house when the doorbell rings. The early caseworker quickly looks around, glances into the other rooms, making notations on a clipboard. \"Dr. Cuddy, you've got sufficient income, a high degree of personal and professional stability, and you care enough to be embarrassed by what a mess this place is\", the man notes. \"Believe me, that puts you head and shoulders above most of the foster moms I visit.\"Jeff tells House and Chase some of the pain is gone, but not all. House, Taub, Kutner, Thirteen and Foreman discuss. Thirteen says maybe Taub was right about it being psychosomatic. House's lawyer, Chris Carrick (James Ingersoll), enters and drops a bill in House's lap. The man sneers the next time House uses his name in a threatening email, it won't be just a bill, it will be a lawsuit.The doctors' pagers go off. Jeff's son convulses in pain on the hallway floor. Several nurses attend to him as House approaches, followed by the team. House says the son is faking. He turns and heads into Jeff's room. House yanks off Jeff's bed sheets and sees he has an empty bottle of rubbing alcohol. The son distracted the orderlies so Jeff could down a bottle of isopropyl. The son yells out to please just let his father die.As Jeff is hooked up to a dialysis machine, as the team discusses the case. The DDX includes Fabry disease, Amyloidosis and lightning pain from syphilis. They are out of ideas. House suggests they can't find anything because whatever injury caused the pain healed long ago. The only thing left is the drugs. Jeff has opioid-induced pain. Both pain and the drugs that treat pain work by changing brain chemistry. Sometimes the pain receptors start reading painkillers as pain.Cuddy tells Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) she passed the home inspection but is disappointed she failed by her own standards. Wilson asks why women always create ridiculous standards no human could meet. He tells her to be like a man and get some help. \"You're not Superwoman, don't be a martyr\", he says.Taub and Kutner prepare to remove the painkillers from Jeff's system with nalaxone. Kutner gives Taub a look. Taub explains to him a colleague once attempted suicide and it was selfish. Kutner can see that Taub is still not over this.House calls Foreman out about messing with the drug trial appointment schedule to move the most promising patient right before Thirteen.House is with a handyman who inspects a large burned and charred wall of his kitchen. House has a copy of his home warranty policy in his hand. He thinks he will have to replace the entire water line to fix the melted pipe. The handyman tells him he is lucky the fire skipped the pipes entirely. House realizes he screwed up.At the hospital, Taub and Kutner attend to Jeff who is strapped into the bed. Jeff groans, sweats and cries through the pain. House has just entered his office to find Jeff's wife waiting for him. She asks House to just stabilize him so he can die at home.House tells Taub he is going home. Foreman, Taub, Thirteen, and Kutner are at a loss. House lies in bed, eyeing the gaping hole in his ceiling. He pays the handyman to bribe him to lie on the claim. House does not care, as long as the people who pocketed his premiums for nine years also pay. He insists he didn't break the pipe. House sees the handyman scratch his privates. He grabs his jacket and cane and heads out.House meets the team in the hospital. Testicles made him think of Epilepsy, which can cause chronic pain if it enlarges to the non-motor part of the brain. House explains the seizures may be in a place you can't see on an EEG, such as deep in the brain like the area controlling the muscles supporting testicles.Jeff and his son walk down the hallway, hand in hand. Jeff pulls the IV stand with the anti-seizure meds making him pain-free for the first time in years. Watching them, Kutner turns to Taub. \"It wasn't your colleague, was it? It was you\", he states. Taub rejects him.Foreman enters the drug trial where Thirteen is seated in a treatment chair, hooked up to an IV. She asks Foreman if he is free tonight. He notices her IV is not properly hooked up and asks the nurse, Rita (Aisha Kabia), about it. She remarks the medicine smells bad. Thirteen's bag has no smell. Foreman realizes Thirteen is on the placebo.Cuddy is swamped by a mountain of work and the baby. She stops and thinks. Cuddy approaches Cameron in the ER and asks why she offered to do House's budget. Cameron thought it would help House to see someone worse off than him. Cuddy offers her job to Cameron. Cameron is not sure how to react.House goes to step into the tub. He puts one leg into the water, and then braces himself by grabbing the shower pipe before lifting his good leg in. He realizes when he puts his weight on the shower pipe, he pulls on it. He was wrong, he did break the pipe.", "episode_24": "An obnoxious man is ragging on his food at a fancy Italian restaurant. Another man at a nearby table lobs rolls at him. He tries to keep control of his hand, but when the guy confronts him the roll-lobber dumps ice water on the grumpy guy's crotch. Then he starts crying blood from one of his eyes. He collapses.House (Hugh Laurie) wakes up in bed, looking around for evidence. He smiles and hobbles down the hall. He sees lipstick on his face in the bathroom mirror and the tube on the bathroom sink. He smiles.Cameron (Jennifer Morrison) tells Taub (Peter Jacobson) there's a glitch with the wedding and then about a guy with a split brain. It's the roll-lobber. He says his left hand hates him.In the differential room, the team stares at House as he comes in singing. He warns them he's in a good mood. They present him with alien hand syndrome guy.\nCuddy (Lisa Edelstein) comes in and tells House they need to talk. They go into his office.\"Isn't this a bit like locking the barn door after the horse has put his face between your breasts for an hour and a half?\" he asks.She reminds him she's his boss and people who get close to him get hurt. He's also a valued doctor at the hospital. He asks if she's freaking out over last night. She says she's just giving him the rules. He watches her leave, smiling, still holding her tube of lipstick.House saunters into Wilson's. He tells him he slept with Cuddy and has been clean from Vicodin for 24 hours. Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) reacts with\"Wow!\" and \"Wow!,\" one for each bit of news.\n\"This is fantastic,\" Wilson says, \"how are you going to screw it up?\" House sees several good options, telling Wilson about the \"just an employee talk.\" Wilson says either she's in love with him or thinks it was a mistake.Taub and Thirteen (Olivia Wilde) go through Two-Brained Guy's house. There's fungus on the ceiling.\nTaub mentions the wedding glitch and Thirteen says it's always sad when sperm comes between two people.Cut to Taub in the cafeteria line with Chase (Jesse Spencer), telling him he hears the sperm is good that day. Taub joins him at his table but Chase walks away.House tells Cuddy that Wilson thinks they need to talk. He keeps scanning her with some hand-held device.Two-Brained Guy's girlfriend brings him stuff from home. She thinks she's trying too hard to get his other half to like him. Thirteen brings him anti-fungal meds. He says it's not a problem as his left hand picks up the deodorant the girlfriend brought and throws it. Then, as girlfriend leans over him, the left hand slaps her (HARD) across the face. She leaves and he tries to follow her, getting out of bed. But he can't walk.Back in differential land, they rule out a fungus as House twirls Cuddy's lipstick tube. House suggests slow-growing mengioma, a cancer which would reconnect the two hemispheres of his brain.House shows Wilson thermal imaging pictures of Cuddy, from which he deduces House didn't talk to her. He thinks she grew heated around him. House says Cuddy either lied to him last night or today and he wants to know which. Wilson implores him to be an adult about it.Foreman (Omar Epps), Taub and Thirteen run a test on Two-Brain Guy, putting words on two different screens to draw reactions from each side of his brain. When he doesn't see the word candle on the left they ask him to draw it. He says he didn't see a word as his left hand picks up the pen and draws a candle. \"This is so cool,\" Taub says.Scott (Ashton Holmes) stands up saying he's cold. House sees him exhibiting signs he is cold. He scratches his side. House announces ammonia breath and looks at his stomach, where he's been scratching. His liver is failing.Wilson talks to Cuddy about something budgetary. She sighs, saying she thought he wanted to talk about something else. Wilson says there's nothing to talk about.\nHouse walks in. He wants to do a liver biopsy. Cuddy says fine and he is upset when she doesn't resist. He peers in closer, trying to make her angry. Then he switches his coffee for hers and leaves.Thirteen tries to do an ultrasound on him but Scott's hand keeps batting it away. He asks if they can get music in the room.Wilson thinks House is using a relationship with Cuddy as a replacement for drugs. He tells him to wait for her to be ready. House says he found oxytocin in her coffee, the chemical involved in emotional bonding. He has to make her lose her temper to make her break her facade. Or outcome two, she kills him. Wilson commends him for committing himself to someone. Then House asks why there's an old guy standing in his doorway.Eugene Schwartz (Carl Reiner)) introduces himself, saying Cuddy sent him from the clinic. He says he squawks like a parrot, but he can't recreate it.As Taub prepares to stick Scott with a very big needle Scott's evil left hand is distracted by music, playing air guitar. His right hand is too. Thirteen sees splinter hemorrhages under his finger nails. Then he rolls over and pukes blood. His heart's fine. Thirteen mentions Scott's sweaty a lot, it had been a problem before the split brain thing. House tells them to scan for pancreatic cancer.Cuddy meets with two donors but they're interrupted by Eugene bringing his stool sample in a paper bag, saying House told him to bring it.Scott packs up, wanting to leave because Annie (Sheila Daley) called saying she was leaving. He tries to get dressed but his left hand and right brain won't let him.Cameron wants to bounce relationship ideas off House. He suggests she destroy her dead husband's sperm. She says doubts are normal.Taub gets House to try to make Scott stay. He enlists Wilson.They run a scan on Scott, trying to get him to communicate with his right brain. Wilson tells him his right brain must be frustrated. Scott's not buying it, but House points out the entire time Wilson was talking, the left hand didn't even twitch.Eugene calls House from the grocery, excited because he just squawked. Cuddy gave him House's number.House thinks Scott's cancer is too small to find. He wants to use scorpion toxin to \"paint\" the cancer.Chase performs surgery. Cameron interrupts, telling him she got the forms to destroy the sperm. Chase has to go back in when Scott's blood pressure drops. There's no sign of cancer.Wilson asks House if he really wants Cuddy or he just likes the challenge. He says he has to take it seriously or one of them will get hurt. House watches Cuddy escort a guy in a pirate costume out, a male stripper. She doesn't look angry. Wilson says House'll be in trouble if she looks up. This means something to House, he gets \"the look.\" He goes to surgery, saying they weren't looking up at the right time. Scott's clots weren't from cancer, they were caused by intermittent arrhythmia. He tells them to do an echo.The team brainstorms what could make his heart spit out clots. House orders a test.Annie visits Scott. He apologizes for hitting her. She tells him she's there to talk to the doctors. Annie says she thought about it a lot and Scott's hand usually throws things playfully, it was never mean. She says he hit her after she handed him his deodorant, and points out he also threw it across the room. He says it's special heavy-duty brand he has to send away for. Thirteen remembers how small his bathroom was, the fumes could get trapped. Taub goes to check the ingredients.Scott's left hand strokes Annie's face sweetly. Thirteen says, \"someone's grateful.\"House asks Wilson why there's no lipstick on Cuddy's coffee cup. Wilson tells House he should make her angry. He hasn't really been trying. \"Now go terrorize her,\" Wilson orders.Chase tells Cameron he thinks she doesn't really want to destroy the sperm. She says she's willing. But he says she doesn't have doubts, she just doesn't want to kill the only thing left from someone she loved. She bursts into tears. He hugs her and tells her not to do it. She tells him she has problems giving things up, for example, she never canceled any of their wedding plans.House stands on the walkway above the entrance and bangs his cane for attention. He announces to everyone he slept with Cuddy. Everyone gapes at him as Cuddy picks that moment to enter the lobby. When she walks in someone informs her what he said. She glares. Finally angry.She confronts him, crying, saying he crossed the line. She congratulates him for making her angry. He says he was wondering if they should move in together. She laughs, wounded, and tells him he's fired.Eugene stands behind him, wanting his test results. House thinks he has acid reflux, but he watches as Eugene adjusts his belt under his gut. It hurts him. House feels his belly. It's not a gut, it's a tumor. That's why pancreatic cancer was on his mind, House realizes.Taub tells House the deodorant has a high level of a chemical that can cause seizures. He tells Taub to take Eugene to radiology.Cuddy cries in her office. House comes in. \"Whatever it is, just stay it quickly,\" she says.\nHe asks her if she has more than one lipstick and if maybe she's over reacting.She says reaching the final straw has made her realize they not only don't have a personal relationship, they never could. He looks confused, saying he told her he needed her. She says he made a very personal, mean remark to her (calling her baby a bastard). House has a sort of double-vision. One is Cuddy getting angry at his remark and leaving, the other is her staying to help.She asks if he's OK and he starts to get foggy. He takes what he thought was the tube of lipstick out of his pocket. It's a bottle of Vicodin. He remembers the night before, both with her and alone. The memories blur. He stares, horrified as some memories play out.Scenes of him twirling what we saw as lipstick turn out to be him with the bottle of pills. He looks at what he thinks is lipstick but instead is popping pills. He remembers.Dead Amber (Anne Dudek) leans in. \"So, this is the story you made up about who you are, it's a nice one.\" Dead Kutner (Kal Penn) (!!!) stands in front of him. \"Too bad it isn't true.\" House starts gasping for air and backs into a corner.He tells Cuddy he's not OK. She holds his face.Cuddy brings him into Wilson's office. By the look on their faces he can tell something is really wrong. House does look shell-shocked.Cut to Chase and Cameron's wedding. Cameron walks down the aisle. It's outdoors and lovely. Wilson drives House somewhere. Cuddy shows up with her daughter, barely keeping it together, she looks sad and preoccupied.Wilson arrives at a very gothic looking building, something right out of Wuthering Heights. House gives Wilson his wallet and watch. He takes his suitcase and walks toward the imposing building, which has \"psychiatric\" in the title over the door. An orderly in white waits outside.Cameron and Chase kiss and walk hand in hand down the aisle, married at last.\nHouse walks into a psychiatric hospital. The doors close behind him.", "episode_23": "Ballerinas and ballerinos practice. The directors worry about Jeremy's back as he prepares for a lift. Ballerina Penelope prances at him and he lifts her over his head. Then he seizes up and drops her. Penelope starts fighting for breath. She can't breathe.House eats some cereal at home as Dead Amber taunts him with ukulele playing. He's mad at her for trying to kill Chase and is trying to ignore her. She says he's not completely rational.Foreman knocks at the door. House says he's taking a personal day. Cuddy says come in or he's fired.In the differential room, they discuss the fact that Penelope's having trouble breathing. House continues to suggest the opposite of whatever Dead Amber says. She's pushing for dehydration, which could hide an infection.Wilson gives a guy the news he has kidney cancer and House interrupts. Wilson tries to run him off. House tells him he's hallucinating. That gets his attention.House thinks he's got sleep apnea that's causing lack of sleep. He wants Wilson to sit in on all his differentials. Dead Amber starts babbling over Wilson and he tells her to shut up. Wilson wants to know who he's seeing.House thinks for a minute and then plays the sympathy card. He says Kutner. Dead Amber approves of the lie.Chase and Cameron share a lovely evening at home. As he talks about work she interrupts, blurting out: \"I have my husband's sperm.\"They froze it when he got sick and she hasn't been able to bring herself to get rid of it. Sentimental body fluids and all.Chase interprets this as meaning she wants a pre-nup, in liquid form.Wilson visits House before his sleep test. Wilson thinks he should be admitted. Dead Amber pops up and tells House that she knows he's wrong about sleep apnea, which means he knows he wrong, too.The next morning House walks in to see Wilson. Dead Amber is with him. Foreman reports that the patient isn't responding to the antibiotics, Penelope still can't breathe. So, not an infection.House suggests a semi-radical treatment which Foreman suggests is like waterboarding. House checks with Wilson that it's no more radical than he usually is and they go for it.When Foreman leaves House gives Wilson his list of theories: infection, trauma, schizophrenia, MS, pills.Dead Amber helps House root for infection, since it can be cured. Wilson wonders what he's hearing.Foreman holds the patient's hand, telling her the water they're going to inject in her lungs will make her feel like she's drowning. They begin the procedure and as Taub tries to hold her down, she slips out of his grasp.\"I slipped,\" he says, holding up a gross-covered hand, \"her skin came off.\"House, Foreman and Dead Amber watch Foreman try to treat the sloughing off skin. House wants an ultrasound of her liver to look for masses. He wants to know what caused the skin issue. He suggests a reaction to the antibiotics he ordered, something that Foreman says would be a one-in-a-million reaction. House thinks maybe this is the one.House interrupts Wilson in the clinic, saying he feels guilty for prescribing the antibiotics that apparently caused it. He thinks his guilt is a symptom of MS.Ballerino Jeremy sits at Penelope's bedside. House visits them. They found a mass in her liver. House, with Dead Amber at his side, apologizes for treating her for the infection she didn't have. He apologizes several times. The two dancers are confused, but say thanks.Foreman confronts House in the hall, wanting to know why he was talking to the patient. \"I think skinless women are hot,\" he says.They can't biopsy her liver because her skin's too shot. He suggests a different kind of biopsy and Foreman sees him check in with Wilson again.House tells Wilson he felt nothing apologizing so he thinks it's MS. Wilson said an apology is not supposed to make House feel better, it is supposed to make the wronged party feel better.Foreman and Chase do the biopsy. Chase mentions that Cameron kept her dead husband's sperm and wants to hang onto it. Foreman says he has to let her go or he'll be stuck with her forever. That's what Chase wants. But Foreman says if he leaves her for any reason he won't just be the guy who left her, he'll be the guy who killed her kids.The patient starts to crash.In differential they report that the biopsy was negative, but now she has a heart problem. But they don't know if that came before or after the lung problem. Foreman wants to know why Wilson is sitting in.House says he was there in case it was cancer, but that doesn't explain why he's staying. Foreman wonders if Cuddy is making him oversee House.House, meanwhile, is completely distracted by Dead Amber going through things at his desk. House throws Wilson out. Dead Amber sits down in his spot with a scalpel she prepares to drive into her arm. If it's not MS, that leaves mental illness or Vicodin. Mental illness would mean he can't practice medicine and Vicodin means he'd have to live with pain. She slices her arm.From this, House gets that she's suggesting they kill the patient - stop her heart long enough to MRI it. The team is wary. House acts confident.Then he goes to check in with Wilson. He says it was \"her\" idea. Wilson notices the pronoun gender discrepancy and questions House. House tells him it's Amber. \"Your subconscious picked my dead girlfriend?\" Wilson says. Wilson says the heart stopping is on the upper end of his normal radical scale.Wilson tells House he had his blood level checked for Vicodin use and it's waaay too high. House is rooting for schizophrenia that he can treat with electroshock. Wilson lists off the possible side effects, including the one that would matter to him most - losing his rational mind.In the MRI machine, Chase kills the patient - but only for a planned three minutes.From his office House calls Wilson in the cafeteria, suggesting insulin shock instead of electroshock. He says he has no symptoms of addiction and he's been popping pills for years and only hallucinating for days. Wilson points out how crazy it is to try insulin shock instead of rehab. Wilson says he'll be up in a few minutes but House suggests he make it two minutes because he's about to inject himself with insulin. Wilson runs out of the cafeteria to House.Back in the MRI room, Thirteen wants to keep looking for a problem but the three minutes have passed. Foreman thinks he spots something but Chase rushes to restart her heart.Dead Amber cries out as House injects himself and everything goes fuzzy. He collapses on the floor, convulsing as Wilson rushes in.Wilson paces next to House in a hospital bed. House wakes up, looking around for Dead Amber. He doesn't see her. He thinks it worked, but he can't remember how to work his zipper. But he checks out otherwise.The team beeps House. Foreman thinks they saw a shadow on her heart. Tumor, scar tissue, lesion... Taub thinks they have to guess because it's all they've got. House walks off.He watches the patient. He realizes nothing changes. An epiphany, all by himself. House thinks Jeremy is being too devoted, out of guilt. He thinks he cheated and she has gonorrhea in her heart (apparently this is possible).House celebrates alone with a beer and onion rings. Foreman calls. Jeremy has gonorrhea, but swears he didn't cheat. Her case, meanwhile, is advanced. The ballerino has stopped hanging out in her room.This bothers House. That means he wasn't guilty, which means House wasn't right, he was just lucky. He slowly looks around the bar. He sees Dead Amber singing \"Enjoy Yourself\" in the corner. House looks petrified. He calls Wilson to come get him.Wilson knows a good rehab clinic it's run by someone he went to school with. At House's place, Foreman calls. The patient's infection has sent her into sepsis. Foreman's panicked. But Wilson hangs up on him saying House is off the case. He tells House the patient is fine. Dead Amber knows he's lying. House wonders why he doesn't feel scared. He doesn't know what he'll do if his only option doesn't work.Back at the hospital Taub, Thirteen and Foreman try to figure out how to save her.House visits Cuddy. He tells her he quits. She wonders what stupid thing he's about to ask for, her babysitter is off the clock at 7:30. He tells her to go \"suckle your bastard child if it makes you feel better.\" She grabs her coat, sighs, and starts to leave. He tells her he's hallucinating.Dead Amber tells him Cuddy's not his keeper. He tells her he needs her. She calls her babysitter.Chase performs surgery. They notice her fingers and toes are turning gray.House pukes in a bucket at his place as Cuddy pats his back. When she leaves the room he looks for his stash. She's already cleaned him out. He's shaking and sweating as he tries to tell her where the rest of his stash is. \"It's like I don't even know who you are anymore,\" Dead Amber says.House writhes in pain and Cuddy offers her hand.Chase wakes up the patient to tell her they got rid of the abscess in her heart but they need to amputate her feet and hands or the gangrene will spread. She says no.Foreman wants to leave but Taub wants to keep thinking of an answer.Cuddy watches as House heaves in the toilet. She gives him some ginger water to ease the nausea. He sees a spare pill. Dead Amber tells him to send her away. He does. Then Dead Amber calls him pathetic, saying if he wants the pill, he should just send her home. As he crawls for it Dead Amber says if he takes the pill he doesn't deserve her, but if he secretly takes it, he doesn't deserve anyone. He stretches out, reaching for it, but Cuddy runs in and snatches it away. She flushes it. House tries unsuccessfully to grab it out of the bowl.Taub and Chase try something radical to re-animate the tissue in her extremities. It looks like it might be working.The next morning, House asks Cuddy to breathe more quietly. She says he's doing great. She says he can come back to work when he's better. She thinks he'll be fine, but he says she's biased because he's her hospital's biggest asset. He says that's why she's there. She says she's not and wouldn't lie. He said she is. Cuddy says she hasn't lied to him in 20 years. House says this is a trick and he deduces that means she lied 20 years ago and wants to confess.And so she does. She wasn't in his endocrinology class in college she said. House said \"yes you were, I sat next to you and cheated off of you all semester.\" Cuddy says she didn't take the class, she audited it. House wonders why. Cuddy says that she thought he was \"an interesting lunatic, even then.\" She's not there protecting hospital property.House looks around and announces they're alone.Dead Amber is gone.The patient wakes up -- with her extremities. She wants to know where Jeremy is. Taub tells her he left.At home, Chase tells Cameron he doesn't have any doubts. She thinks that's na\u00efve. She wants to spend the rest of her life with him, but doesn't know. He says he'll wait until she does.Cuddy puts on her coat to leave, telling House she'll see him later. He thanks her.\"You want to kiss me, don't you?\" she says, seeing him standing close. \"I always want to kiss you,\" he says.And so they do.And her coat comes off. And IT finally happens. Way to go House!Next week: Season Finale!", "episode_6": "House (Hugh Laurie) and Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) hooked up! OK, they just kissed. But, House and Cuddy hooked up! We'll get back to that later. But, House and Cuddy hooked up!But we digress...:We opened on a guy having some serious issues in his kitchen, apparently pouring himself cups of coffee from a row of coffee makers on his counter, and dumping them into the sink. He is marking down results on a clipboard. His 12 year old daughter comes in and he asks her if she called a friend to spend the night (it's her birthday). She tells him that when he has a friend over, so will she. She leaves for school and suddenly is home again, telling him that it is 4:30pm. He has lost time. Later he blinks and is sitting in the living room with her, again losing hours. His daughter was equally flabbergasted by his bizarre behavior. She finally asked him what was wrong and he said, \"I don't know.\"Cue: awesome theme music.Cuddy was giddy about her adoption approval and handed House the case of the messed-up, coffee-drinking guy. House knew Cuddy was meeting the mother of a baby she would be getting and Cuddy admitted the woman was delivering a baby girl in two weeks. The birth mother had confessed to \"some past meth use.\" House told Cuddy \"you're not equipped to handle a real kid, let alone a factory second.\" Cuddy said she wasn't going to change her mind about adopting.The coffee guy was a consumer product tester who worked at home and the team was trying to figure out his problem.Thirteen (Olivia Wilde) and Taub (Peter Jacoboson) went to check the guy's house and found a barren room where his young daughter lived. Taub said single people shouldn't have kids. They found some mold in the baseboards of the apartment. It's never mold. Back at the hospital, Thirteen did some tests on the daughter. The girl said she was four when \"the accident happened\" and her mother died. She said, completely stone faced, that she didn't \"get what the big deal about death is.\" Thirteen and Foreman (Omar Epps) saw the patient trying to leave the hospital and they realized he was sleepwalking.Foreman insisted sleepwalking wasn't a diagnosis if they didn't know why he was sleepwalking. House realized they were only going to find out what the guy was up to if they let him walk out his dreams while sleeping.Cuddy went to meet the birth mother, Becca (Vanessa Zima), at a diner. She just had one question for Cuddy, which was what she was going to name the baby. Cuddy said she was thinking about \"Joy.\" The girl said she didn't want her daughter raised by a loser, which her mother had been, and she had been, which was why she was giving the baby up to Cuddy despite her being a single parent. Cuddy saw a rash on the girl's wrist, but she insisted she hadn't used since she found out she was pregnant.Cuddy worried it was a viral infection, but Cameron (Jennifer Morrison) said it was just a heat rash. Cuddy admitted the woman to the hospital, but Cameron thought she was overreacting. She wanted a full fetal workup. House said she was having irrational fears. House spilled \"baby barf\" all over Cuddy's sweater, to give her a feel of what it'll be like when she's barfed on eight times a day.Taub and Thirteen followed the sleepwalker as he drove around town and stops to talk to a woman in an alley. Thirteen seemed to know instantly the woman was a drug dealer and not a prostitute. She and Taub go to the man's car and find cocaine. House later tells them to get some of the cocaine for testing. Taub reminds him it's a felony, but he doesn't care.Cameron and Cuddy did an ultrasound and found that the baby's lungs were underdeveloped, meaning they had to put off the birth to protect the baby.Taub and Thirteen set off to buy the drugs. The dealer, Sadie (Janice Allen) sold them \"good stuff,\" but Thirteen objected and said she didn't want the \"good, get the new customer hooked stuff,\" she wanted the \"stepped down, keep the old customer coming back stuff.\" Taub was a little taken aback but how much Thirteen seemed to know about the street-level drug trade.House continued to tell Cuddy she was being selfish by wanting a child to give him \"unconditional love.\" He knocked over a lamp in her office to portend what she could expect when the girl grows up. Cuddy was with Becca in her room when she started bleeding. The woman had a placental abruption and she was losing blood. The solution would be to deliver the baby, but the premature lungs in the baby created the ultimate dilemma: deliver now, risk the baby; deliver later, risk the mom. Cuddy knew the mother would do whatever she told her to do. House said she should deliver now (risking the baby), but when Cuddy agreed, he knew something was wrong. He said you can give the mom more blood, you can't give the baby more lungs. He decided some part of Cuddy didn't want the baby.Wilson (Robert Sean Wilson) told House he was just upset because Cuddy was moving to another stage in her life and leaving him behind. House wasn't buying that.Meanwhile, Taub decided the cocaine was causing the sleepwalking guy's problem. Oh, but wait... the guy was sweating blood. They tested for leukemia.The birth mother asked Cuddy what she'd do and Cuddy said she should wait. \"But if I wait, I could die,\" the girl said. She wondered if Cuddy was giving her opinion as a doctor or as a mother. The girl said she didn't want to wait, she'd \"sacrificed nine months for this stupid mistake, I don't want to sacrifice anymore.\" Cuddy told her she had a chance to break the cycle of parenting mistakes her mother and grandmother had made. \"No,\" she said.Just as Taub and Kutner (Kal Penn) had jammed the needle into the sleepwalker to test the guy's bone marrow for leukemia, they noticed his skin was dark on his arm. \"That means it's not leukemia,\" Kutner said. The team decided the sleepwalker might need a kidney transplant, so they thought about testing his daughter for a match. They needed Cuddy's approval for such a move because the daughter was a minor and her dad had a conflict of interest. \"She's kind of busy,\" Taub said.Cut to Cuddy in surgery, where the adoptive mother was having her baby delivered via Cesarean section by Chase (Jesse Spencer), under Cuddy's watchful eye. House barged into the operating room and asked Cuddy about the sleepwalker's daughter. \"Later,\" she said. \"Later's too late,\" House said. Just then, Chase pulled the baby out but it wasn't crying at first. Cuddy held her and the mother said, \"She's yours now.\"\"Mazel tov,\" House said. Then demanded she get back to work. She talked to the daughter about the risks of surgery. The girl said she understood the risks, but House said he couldn't proceed. He realized the girl had whatever her dad had -- she was sleepwalking.Thirteen discovered the girl was sweating blood, too. They had to run tests for a genetic disease. House asked Wilson for a genetic disease that would fit the symptoms, but Wilson just kept talking about Cuddy's new baby. He reiterated House thought adopting was \"a cheat\" and that it wasn't a real baby. House got that familiar look of epiphany and Wilson said, \"I've just given you the answer, haven't I? And now you're going to walk away without saying a word.\" House does walk out, but adds one word, \"Nope\". Nice one, Wilson.House said he knew what they had and they'd be fine, but when they had no reactions, he said they were \"anhedonic,\" incapable of feeling pleasure. Foreman said the most common cause of anhedonia is schizophrenia. \"Sure, in white folk,\" House said, revealing that they were lying about their backgrounds. The father's name was Jamal Hamoud (Salvator Xuereh). He changed it when the U.S. invaded Iraq the first time. House told him they had Familial Mediterranean Fever, a disease contracted by people of Mediterranean decent. The symptoms were set off by age and stress. House said the treatment could be hit or miss because of the disease's advanced stage.Cuddy was painting her nursery yellow and Thirteen was watching over the patients. Cuddy smiled as she looked around the room. The medication worked on the sleepwalker and his daughter, as they both smiled for the first time in a while.Cuddy visited the birth mother, who told Cuddy that she wants to be brave and secure, like Cuddy. \"I don't want to be a loser,\" she told Cuddy. \"When I saw you hold her, and the look on your face, it was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen.\" She decided she didn't want to give up the baby. She said her life had \"always been about pain and anger and disappointment, and it's never been about love; and I can't give that away.\" Cuddy tried to tell her not to make sure a huge decision that easily. \"It's a decision that changes everything; it changes the rest of your life,\" Cuddy said. \"I hope so,\" the girl replied.Cuddy went to the nursery and cried as she touched the baby's tiny hand, then she went and sat alone in the freshly painted nursery. House knocked on the door. He told Cuddy there were more babies out there, but she said she was \"done.\" She couldn't go through that again. \"It's too bad, you would've been a good mother,\" House said. Cuddy gets really ticked off. She snaps at him that when she had the baby he told her she would suck as a mother, now that she doesn't that she would be a good one. She asks why he needs to negate everything. He looks stunned and mumbles something like \"I don't know\".Then they kissed. Long and deep and passionate. Then House left.", "episode_3": "We opened on an artist painting a nude portrait of a woman for her and her husband. When he was done, the husband was so offended he punched the artist in the face, telling him he wanted a refund. When we finally saw the portrait, we discovered the woman's face and figure were all squiggly and distorted. Something's wrong with this artist.Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) told House (Hugh Laurie) the hospital was not going to cover the cost of his private investigator, Lucas (Michael Weston). The team studied the artist's portraits and tried to figure out what was wrong with the patient. House told Thirteen (Olivia Wilde) he knew she paid 12 percent on her car loan. He also knew Kutner (Kal Penn) once crawled 20 miles to get into the Guinness Book of World Records. Kutner asked House what he had on Taub (Peter Jacobson). He said nothing. \"Taub's wife, on the other hand....\" He didn't continue.The artist showed Foreman (Omar Epps) and Thirteen some drawings he'd done since the incident, which looked fine. He thought maybe it was something he ate. Kutner and Taub searched the artist's apartment. Kutner wondered whether Taub thought his wife was cheating on him.House thought it was drugs. So to get the man to consent to a drug test Thirteen said he'd never consent to, House decided to tell the man he had a brain tumor. He said they'd have to cut his head open. The guy simply said, \"No.\"\"Wrong answer,\" House said.\"I'm not allowed to say no?\" he asked.\"You're not allowed to not be terrified,\" House said.House said the only way he could not be terrified was if he was on drugs. House deduced the guy doesn't make enough money as an artist, so he participates in medical tests -- taking untested drugs -- to bring in steady money and keep his hot girlfriend.House was right, and the guy admitted it. He said the drugs he was taking -- three of them -- were soon going to be approved by the FDA.Taub came to House's office to see what he'd found out about his wife. House said she has a separate bank account and she'd been making weekly deposits but making no withdrawals. Taub claimed he knew about the account and said it was for furniture. It held $100,000.The patient went into some kind of shock.The team had to break down the three drugs. House decided to give them cute named. The first was \"bisex-idrine,\" in honor of Thirteen. The second was \"Cuckold-isol,\" for Taub, but House continued to insist he knew about the bank account. The third was \"World's Sorest Knees-isil,\" in honor of the 20-mile-crawling Kutner.The patient was put on dialysis but became worried his girlfriend would find out the real cause of his health problem. He didn't want her to find out. Thirteen got Taub to admit he didn't know about his wife's bank account, but he claimed he wasn't worried. \"She makes me happy. I make her happy. It works,\" he said. House told Taub that he'd forgive her for the bank account and confess that he'd cheated on her.\"What purpose could that possibly serve?\" Taub asked.\"None,\" House said, \"which is why I'm not saying you should. But you will.\"House began having conversations with Lucas through a wireless device tucked in his ear. The patient had another traumatic moment, including his head and neck swelling.House said it was still the drug cocktail. The effects could have been worsened by the dialysis. The PI continued to follow Cuddy around the hospital and was digging around her desk when she found him. He asked her out on a date. He offered her embarrassing information on House, which he said could help her keep him in line.We saw Taub at home, eating dinner with his wife, Rachel. He was a little quiet before he claimed he was looking through her desk for a letter opener when he stumbled on to bank statements from her secret account. She said she wanted to keep it a surprise, but she'd bought him \"the car.\" She'd been saving, and it was going to be delivered on Friday. \"You are amazing,\" he told her.Thirteen told the patient he was drug-free and he thanked her. He looked her up and down quickly before grabbing her, pulling her on top of him and kissing her neck. She punched him in the face as nurses rushed in. \"What happened to his face?\" Foreman asked. \"The question is, what happened to his hormones?\" Thirteen responded.The doctors decided they could rule out the clinical trial drugs because he'd tested clean twice. Taub told House he was wrong about his wife and House owed him an apology.House came home to find his private investigator, Lucas, hiding in his closet. They talked about Cuddy and how the PI actually liked her. They realized they're both going after Cuddy.The patient struggled with whether to tell his girlfriend the truth. Taub told him wanting to tell the truth was noble, but if it only caused trouble and pain, it wasn't noble. House was making Taub work long hours to keep him from going home, reasoning his guilt about cheating would fade with time away from home.The patient went into shock while being tested for something and House and noticed the patient's hair was growing in red. He asked if he was dying his hair and the patient said no. \"Either he's lying about dying,\" House said. \"Or just dying.\"On their date, Lucas showed Cuddy a picture of House as a cheerleader in college. He asked her about her parents, then asked when she lost her virginity. He told he's into her because she was hot and smart. He said she should have known the photo was fake and that \"this is a game.\" He left -- almost. Then he realized if she knew he wasn't going to give her anything worthwhile and she wasn't going to give him anything worthwhile, she went out with him because she liked him.Thirteen and Taub explained the risks of surgery to the patient, but he saw them as different people and asked where Dr. Taub and Dr. Hadley were. Taub and Thirteen told House they couldn't do the surgery. Taub theorized the artist, at some point, had used some bad paint and it stored itself in some fat cells and released into his bloodstream. Taub wanted to check the paint on some of his old, unsold paintings. Taub asked the patient if he could talk to him about his old paintings, and the man asked his girlfriend to leave. She got suspicious and he told her the truth about his drug trials. She forgave him for lying. Taub looked impressed.The patient was being prepped for surgery as Taub went to check some of the old paintings. He found one with a distorted face and put together a pattern. The patient had distorted paintings every other month because those were the months when he was on all three drugs at the same time. House figured out the drugs were collecting in the man's abdomen in some kind of hairball-like mass that was growing, holding some of the drugs and occasionally releasing them into his bloodstream. That was effectively giving him overdoses of the drugs over the past week.Chase (Jesse Spencer) removed the disgusting looking thing in surgery and said, \"That is why I wouldn't let Cameron get a cat.\"Taub told the patient's girlfriend he was going to be fine. He asked her if she was glad he'd told her the truth and she said she was. He then asked if she was happier before she knew, and before she could answer, his wife surprised him with the keys to his new car. She blindfolded him and took him out to the parking garage to see it, and when he opened his eyes, he looked disappointed.His wife asked if he was alright.\"We need to talk,\" Taub said.The PI told House that Cuddy didn't buy the cheerleading photo. But the PI had discovered the photo was actually real, which he called \"humiliating.\"MEDICAL REVIEW :Brandon (Breckin Meyer) is, at best, a mildly successful artist. At the beginning of the episode, he is painting a portrait of a woman, but when the woman and her husband take a look at the finished product, they are shocked because the subject in the painting is horribly distorted. Even stranger is the fact Brandon cannot tell anything is wrong; the portrait looks completely normal to him.Brandon is admitted to the hospital for evaluation of his acute onset visual agnosia. The initial differential diagnosis include stroke, brain tumor, drugs, or environmental toxins. An initial MRI was negative, but House wants an MRI with contrast. He also sends Taub and Kutner to search Brandon's apartment for toxins. The search turns up nothing suspicious and the MRI is negative.Toxins and drugs remain on the differential diagnosis, but a cavernous angioma of the brain (large, abnormally dilated blood vessels in the brain) has been added as well. When Brandon shows little emotion after being told he requires a risky surgical biopsy, House deduces he is hiding something. It turns out he has had to make ends meet by enrolling in clinical trials of new drugs. He is currently a participant in three separate drug trials. House assures him his symptoms were due to the experimental drugs, and since they should be out of his system by now, hell be discharged in the morning.As usual, being discharged from Princeton Plainsboro is a sign of problems to come, and Brandon has a sudden seizure. By now, the team has discovered what drugs Brandon was being given: an anticoagulant, an autoimmune drug, and a statin (a cholesterol medication). They suspect the interaction of all three drugs is causing his symptoms and House elects to give him dialysis to clean all the drugs out of his system. It seems to work at first, but then Brandon develops massive swelling of the tissues of the head and neck occluding his airway. Foreman performs an emergency tracheotomy and Brandon is started on steroids. The differential now includes a thrombosis, Chagas disease (both of which would block the venous drainage, causing swelling), infection, or cytokine storm, with the team favoring the latter. House and the team are unsure whether the cytokine storm is a withdrawal symptom from the experimental drugs, or a new symptom entirely. To solve the puzzle, House elects to put Brandon back on all three drugs, and then wean them off slower this time.Once again, withdrawing the drugs seems to work at first, but then it becomes obvious Brandon's libido has been put in overdrive. A punch to the nose from Dr. Thirteen solves that problem, at least temporarily, but it is a new symptom to consider. Kluver-Bucy Syndrome (a condition caused by damage to both temporal lobes of the brain) is suspected, and an MR Angiogram is obtained to get a closer look at the blood vessels. It shows some narrowing of the vessels of the Circle of Willis (the main arteries supplying the brain). That should not be enough to cause symptoms, but Taub suspects there may an underlying cardiac arrhythmia that worsens them. An EP study (electrophysiology study it looks for abnormal conduction in the heart) is ordered, and is decidedly positive. During the test, Brandon goes into ventricular tachycardia and needs to be defibrillated. At this point, House notices Brandon's hair is turning red around the temples.Kluver-Bucy is abandoned and Waardenburg Syndrome is suggested, but when Kutner notices a prolonged QT on the EKG (a potentially dangerous heart rhythm), the suspicion shifts to Romano-Ward Syndrome (a common inherited form of Long QT Syndrome). A cardiac sympathectomy (a surgery that reduces the effect of the sympathetic nervous system on the heart) is ordered. When Brandon once again develops visual agnosia, Taub begins suspects the symptoms may be due to lingering toxins, and seeks out Brandon's old paintings. The paintings show the same distortion every other month the same time he was on all three experimental medications together. It turns out that in a previous research project, Brandon had been on an experimental antacid which allowed the formation of a bezoar in his stomach. This bezoar trapped many of the experimental pills and has slowly been releasing them, causing Brandon's symptoms even though he has not been taking any new medications (which means the team had it right halfway through, it was the combination of the experimental drugs, and the last half of the episode was spent chasing one red herring after another. After all, who can argue against the symptoms of experimental drug reaction?) The bezoar is removed surgically and Brandon should be good as new.", "episode_14": "A chef was giving a tutorial in a restaurant, where an assistant was making smart-aleck remarks about his instructions. She suddenly started breathing heavily and coughing, before calling out some of her own symptoms. She said she was a doctor and she needed a doctor.Thirteen (Olivia Wilde) woke up in bed with Foreman (Omar Epps), who teased her about drooling.Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) was doing dishes in the morning, but left a green mug on the counter with a lipstick mark on it. He looked at it as he dried his hands and walked away.House (Hugh Laurie) arrived at the hospital to find the elevators broken. He climbed the stairs. The team told her about the patient, Dana Miller (Judith Scott), a cancer researcher. Kutner (Kal Penn) walked in and said he'd taken the elevator. Thirteen had already told him it was working fine when she arrived earlier.Dana told Thirteen and Taub (Peter Jacobson) she'd quit her medical work because she wasn't happy. She was learning how to run a kitchen because that was what she wanted to do and it made her happy.Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) showed House video of her baby on her computer. He asked her about the elevators crashing. Cuddy said, \"Elevators can be capricious; sometimes it just seems like they're out to get you.\"He asked why they'd be out to get him. She said because he was the reason she had to be back at work -- because he wouldn't listen to Cameron. \"Congratulations,\" she told him. \"You've officially brought me down to your level.\"The doctors all discussed Dana's decision to quit her cancer research because it wasn't making her happy. House said everyone is motivated by self-interest -- they were all there because it made them happy. House asked Foreman if Thirteen knew he slipped her the Huntington's drug. \"You said that would be stupid,\" Foreman said. \"There's nothing to know.\"Foreman was running Thirteen through some tests. She said she had a headache, which led Foreman to ask questions. She said she'd been on the drug for weeks, \"it's not like something's just going to crop up now.\"Taub talked with Dana and told her he missed being a plastic surgeon, but his new job was fulfilling and made him feel like he'd done something worthwhile that day. She said she missed that, too, but it just wasn't enough. She then said something didn't feel right and Taub injected a syringe into her stomach and said it was filled with blood.First her lung deflated, then her liver started to bleed. House was walking and talking with the team when he tripped and fell through his doorway. Someone had set up a trip wire. The team wondered why he wasn't obsessing and knew he must already know who did it.House noticed something happening with Thirteen, but didn't say anything. He told the team to run some tests on the patient. He told Foreman privately he had a problem. He'd noticed Thirteen turning her head to look at an MRI, which meant she was losing her peripheral vision -- probably because of the Huntington's drug.Wilson wondered what House's response to Cuddy would be, but House said he wasn't going to because the only way to get through this war would be to lose and move on. Wilson noticed House's patient was Dana Miller, then went to ask why she quit.\"How is someone like me supposed to keep fighting when someone like you just walked away?\" he asked her. She said people were mad at her for leaving her job, which she said was easier for them to do than to admit they were stuck in a rut. She asked him, \"What's your rut?\" He said nothing.At home that night, Taub asked his wife Rachel (Jennifer Crystal Foley) if she thought they should have kids. She reminded him she'd told him 10 years ago she didn't want kids. She said she still didn't want to. He said he was OK with that and she turned the TV back on.Foreman admitted to Thirteen he'd just switched her drugs the previous weeks. She said she'd stop taking the drug and \"everything should be fine.\" She then went on trying to do her work as if nothing ever happened. She told Foreman she didn't think she was \"ready for that,\" referring to the fact he'd broken trial protocol to give her a drug he didn't even know would work.Foreman went into Dana's hospital room and saw she was still scratching the side of her head. (She'd done this earlier, when Wilson went to talk to her). He noticed she had scratched through her skull and brain matter was leaking out.House, who'd left his cane hanging on an overhead fixture, ordered an MRI after the team couldn't agree on the cause of the itchiness. When House reached for his cane, it was gone.Foreman told Thirteen he wanted to do an MRI on her to try to explain her worsening headaches after going off the treatment. Foreman looked at the screen and said, \"Oh, God.\" Foreman told House that Thirteen had a tumor. He said he was going to the drug company to find out if the same had happened with other patients. House told Foreman to wait because if she still had the tumor, she'd need him to have a medical license. Foreman went to tell Thirteen about House's recommendation and found her leg bleeding because she fell over a table. She couldn't see anything.House spent the night sleeping on a couch in Wilson's office because, \"Apparently Mrs. House called the utility company and told them we were moving,\" House said. There was no heat or power.The patient experienced some kind of spinal shocks before the MRI began. Taub suggested a spinal hemangioma might explain her symptoms. \"Go find it,\" House said.Thirteen sat alone in her apartment when House walked in. He noticed she couldn't see. She told House that Foreman was on his way to the drug company. House admitted he told Foreman to switch her drug if he loved her. He told her to call him and tell him to turn around if she actually felt something for him. She dialed the phone.Wilson told Cuddy she was physically hurting House. \"That's the point,\" she said.Wilson said if she was miserable with House, she should fire him and go be home with her new baby. She said she liked what he does for the hospital. \"What he does is who he is,\" Wilson said. \"And the same goes for you.\"Foreman and House were giving Thirteen a dose of radiation. Foreman was feeling bad about everything he'd done. He said she never considered her in his equation.Taub and Kutner knew something was going on with Foreman and Thirteen. On Dana's MRI, they found masses everywhere.\"The irony of it,\" House said. \"Maybe she wouldn't be sick at all if some other cancer researcher hadn't gone home early.\"House told them to have Wilson do a biopsy. Kutner said no. He knew something was going on with Thirteen and he wanted to know what it was. Taub decided to go ask Wilson to do the biopsy. Kutner stayed behind and asked House if Thirteen's headache was not just a headache.Wilson apologized to Dana, while doing the biopsy, and told her she was right -- he was stuck. He said he was still living in her apartment and left all of her things in place. She said, \"The only wrong thing is to do nothing.\"He inserted a massive syringe to do the biopsy and she said, \"That's not supposed to happen.\"Kutner was in Thirteen's room, trying to come up with some options. Thirteen said Foreman didn't get to torch his career to pay for his sins. Kutner called Foreman a hypocrite because he didn't ask Thirteen if she wanted to be on the drug, but was letting her call the shots about how to deal with her new problem. Thirteen said she'd feel worse if he destroyed his career.Wilson said the type of cancer they thought Dana had doesn't bleed, but she'd started bleeding when he did the biopsy. Then, Taub got paged because Dana's heart stopped. \"What causes that?\" House wondered.As Kutner and Taub responded, Kutner thought he'd successfully gotten her heart rate back down. But Taub noticed she was suddenly bleeding from her nose -- and her eyes.The doctors could barely keep up with her blood loss. House wanted them to cut off the blood supply to the tumors. That would risk killing healthy cells around her lungs, but he wanted them to do it anyway.Cuddy gave House his cane. She apologized for acting like a jerk. He said she wasn't doing the job well before the baby came along. She said he was just going back to play the part he thought he was supposed to play.While blaming Cuddy's mood swings on \"Aunt Flow,\" House had his epiphany. He went into Dana's room and explained to Taub and Kutner her surgery from eight months earlier for a myoma must have resulted in a cut in her uterine wall. Every cut of scalpel resulted in endometrial cells spilling into her bloodstream. They multiplied and when her uterus was supposed to swell, all the organs that those cells adhered to swelled. That was why she was bleeding everywhere.\"Yes, ladies,\" House said, \"I am blaming her period. Granted, this is the worst period ever. Although, frankly, not by much.\"House said they could cut out the masses and everything should be fine. Taub said they couldn't do the surgery until her cycle was complete.Foreman touched Thirteen's hand and said he was sorry. She could see him. They hugged.Taub talked to Dana and told her she'd almost died for the second time in eight months. \"How are you feeling about your life choices now?\" he asked.He said he worries that on his death bed, he'll regret not doing anything great. She said he'll spend one day on his death bed. \"The other 25,000 are the ones we have to worry about,\" she added. \"Go to bed happy tonight.\"Foreman, meanwhile, made a call to a Dr. Schmidt and said, \"The trial isn't going too well.\"House found Foreman in the locker room and knew he'd spilled the beans. He had to pull Thirteen's data from the trial and if anyone else gets a tumor, they'll have to put a warning on the label. Also, they'll come after him if he tries to participate in any more trials.Taub couldn't sleep and his wife asked if he could be happy without a kid. \"I don't know,\" he said. \"I know I can't be happy without you.\"Thirteen and Foreman were in bed together and she teased him for snoring.Wilson was washing dishes and, after a moment of hesitation, grabbed the lipstick-marked mug and washed it.", "episode_15": "We opened on a priest with a bit of a problem. Once he was all alone, after giving a homeless man a hoodie to keep warm, the priest took part in some heavy drinking and smoking. After hearing a knock on the door, the priest opened it to find an image of Jesus, complete with the crown of thorns, floating in front of him as if still on the cross.Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) invited House (Hugh Laurie) to a Jewish baby naming ceremony, even though he had plans to have sex with two hookers. Just the rabbi, a few friends and some family.\"Wish I could, but I already put down a deposit on 16 crates of Jell-O,\" House said.Cuddy pleaded, \"It's one evening. I'd like you to be there.\"House flipped through some files in the E.R. and found the case of the priest. Cameron (Jennifer Morrison) thought it was either alcohol or exhaustion. House mocked her for not knowing which it was. She said she didn't care to figure out who House was messing with -- or, with whom House was messing.The team also tried to figure out why House was interested in the case. They figured he either wanted to screw with them or the hallucinating priest. \"Both are possible,\" House said. \"Only one way to find out.\"House pulled Thirteen (Olivia Wilde) and Foreman (Omar Epps) aside and told her to make a choice between relationship and career. He told her to mull it over and decide by the end of the case.Taub (Peter Jacobson) and Kutner (Kal Penn) learned the priest, Daniel Bresson (Jimmi Simpson), had lived all over the country for short periods of time. He explained a teen in a youth group at his church accused him of sexual misconduct. He said each time he landed at a new church, he was sent off to another one after everyone found out why he had been transfered.Taub suggested maybe the priest really did see Jesus.\"I'm not insane,\" Daniel said.Kutner noted that the notion of seeing Jesus making him insane was an \"odd attitude coming from a priest.\"The priest said, \"It's just a job now. The fairy tale ended a long time ago.\"House mocked Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) for being a wuss and planning to attend Cuddy's ceremony. After Wilson suggested Cuddy might actually want him to be there, House agreed it was \"oddly flattering\" Cuddy invited him.Thirteen was upset about House's games. She told Foreman he shouldn't always defend House and suggested he was co-dependent. Foreman then realized House didn't want to fire either of them, he just wanted to make them fight. So they decided to do nothing.House thought it was cool the priest didn't believe in God. Taub wanted to discharge the priest, saying there was nothing wrong with him. House figured if the case was over, it was \"bad news for Foreman and Thirteen.\"He asked them what they decided and Thirteen said they weren't splitting up and neither of them was quitting.\"Interesting,\" House said. Then he fired Foreman.House told Foreman the difference between Thirteen and Foreman's relationship compared to Chase (Jesse Spencer) and Cameron's was Chase never compromised his professional judgment to help Cameron. House took Foreman's badge, then told Thirteen to \"find us a real case.\"Daniel wanted to stay in the hospital, certain there was something wrong with him. He was saying he had pain in his left foot. Kutner pulled the sheet back and said, \"Oh, God.\" Then he told the priest his toe had fallen off.House was pleased there was a real symptom. He told Taub and Kutner that Foreman was fired and Thirteen was mad, which was why they weren't there. Taub and Kutner made their cases for Thirteen and Foreman while House went over possible diagnoses.Foreman said he was going to find another job. He told Thirteen that House was right and their relationship did affect his judgment. She wanted to quit, but he told her not to.\"Don't worry,\" he told her. \"I'll be fine. We'll be fine.\"House got into the elevator with Cuddy and tried to get her to admit she only invited him to the ceremony to keep him away from it, knowing he wouldn't go if he knew she wanted him there. She told him it was a sincere invitation, then she went to Wilson's office and let him have it.\"You idiot,\" she told Wilson. \"I was free and clear -- now he's coming and it's your fault.\"She told Wilson he messed it and now he had to fix it -- and keep her name out of it.The doctors were monitoring the priest in a hyperbaric chamber (where he'd been placed to avoid any more appendages from falling off -- and he had what Kutner thought was a heart attack.Foreman went to Cuddy and asked her for a letter of recommendation. She said the reality is House was right to fire him. She said he was lucky to still have a license. He told her he couldn't get a decent position at another hospital without a recommendation.\"I'm sorry,\" she said.It turned out Daniel didn't have a heart attack, and House lamented the fact he'd fired the only doctor on his team who knew what a heart attack looked like.House met the priest, and loved the priest's cynicism and lack of faith in God, but said, \"Damn, I wish you weren't a pedophile.\"As they were treating the priest, they realized he had lost feeling in some of his body.Wilson questioned House's sudden decision to attend Cuddy's baby-naming ceremony. House said, \"OK, your obligation to Cuddy is filled.\" Wilson wondered why House was messing with Cuddy.\"She's trying to play me,\" House said. \"If I let her succeed, the terrorists win.\"Thirteen went to Cameron and asked about an opening in the E.R. She wanted to take it so House would hire Foreman back. Chase told Thirteen not to quit. Chase said Foreman shouldn't leave either. Then he said, \"Office romances are a bad idea.\" Then he told Cameron, \"We beat some very long odds.\"\"Wow,\" Cameron said. \"Why don't you save the gushy stuff for the wedding?\"Chase suggested House knew it wasn't going to work out and might be doing them a favor by splitting them up. Cameron said they are looking for a doctor at Mercy and she'd make a call.Kutner and Taub were treating the priest when he realized he was going blind and could see nothing out of one eye.The team was trying to figure out what was wrong with the priest when House launched into an impressive metaphor involving Duran Duran and a lack of fans at their show in 2009 compared to back in the '80s. Thirteen said she didn't speak \"hair band,\" but Kutner corrected her and said, \"They weren't a hair band, they were 'new romantics.'\"The fans were white blood cells, in this metaphor, and the reason they weren't around was because they -- like Duran Duran fans -- weren't being produced anymore.\"You think ... his spleen?\" Taub asked.\"Why do I even bother with these great metaphors if I still have to spell it out?\" House wondered. \"Yes, I think it's his spleen. Go get a biopsy while I try to get 'New Moon on Monday' out of my head.\"Thirteen asked House if he'd rehire Foreman if she quit. He asked why and she said she could find a job more easily than Foreman. House asked if Foreman knew about the plan and Thirteen said he did. House looked skeptical, then said, \"If he's OK with it, who am I to say no?\"House got into another discussion with the priest. He asked the priest if he still had faith and if thought that, if House saved him, God was working through him. The priest laughed it off. House said he thought the priest, despite his cynicism, still had an inkling of faith and the priest laughed that off, too. He told House he was a hypocrite because he acts like he doesn't care about anyone, yet spends every day saving lives.\"Solving puzzles,\" House said. \"Saving lives is just collateral damage.\"Bresson thought House wanted to be proven wrong to give him hope.\"You want to believe, don't you?\" the priest asked House.\"Yeah,\" House said. \"I want to walk out and find myself in a forest of whore trees. But I don't think it's a good idea to tell people to fornicate with fruit.\"Cuddy told House he was right and she didn't want him at her ceremony.\"It's a special occasion filled with love and acceptance,\" she said, \"and the last thing I need is someone there who is filled with loathing and contempt.\"\"OK,\" House said, saying he was really not coming.Kutner told Thirteen that House was probably just messing with her and Foreman, but Taub said they should split up anyway. Kutner said \"if you find something that could be good, you should hang on to it.\"Thirteen found some \"minor bugs\" in the priest's spleen.House asked the priest why people find God when they have kids. \"Fear of the unknown,\" the priest said.The doctors came to House and told him it looked like something small was making Daniel sick. Taub said it looked like the priest had a bug that never makes people sick \"unless they have a compromised immune system.\"\"Looks like Father Nietzsche has AIDS,\" House said.\"Impossible,\" Daniel said. He said he'd never had a blood transfusion, done IV drugs or had sex. Yet, he refused to have an AIDS test.He said on the off chance there was a false positive he'd lose all credibility. Taub said he'd already lost that. Taub was worried about \"the kid he molested\" and wanted to make sure that kid was tested for AIDS. Kutner said they couldn't do that, legally. House told them to start treating the priest for AIDS.Thirteen told Foreman she could get a new job at Mercy and he could get his job back. Foreman got upset and told her he was going to handle it. \"House knew you'd be like this,\" Thirteen told him.\"I guess House knows me better than you do,\" Foreman said. \"Too bad I don't go both ways.\"Thirteen left.House told Wilson his attendance at Cuddy's ceremony was validating Cuddy's hypocrisy. \"Everyone's a hypocrite, why are you so obsessed with Cuddy's particular brand?\" Wilson asked.Taub went and tracked down Ryan (Jake Thomas), the kid the priest allegedly molested. Taub told Ryan they believed the priest had AIDS.\"OK, so?\" the kid said.\"Given the incident four years ago, I suggested you get tested, unless you've already done so,\" Taub said.Ryan asked how sick the priest was. \"Very,\" Taub said. Ryan said OK and turned around.Taub asked Ryan if he had been tested and Ryan said, \"Umm, yeah.\"\"And?\" Taub asked.\"And it's none of your business,\" Ryan said.Foreman came into House's office and asked for his job back. Thirteen walked in and asked what was going on. Thirteen and Foreman then got into a fight in front of House, claiming the other was trying to take control.\"You're an idiot,\" Thirteen said, before walking out.\"Well,\" House said to Foreman. \"Either you go after her and try to patch things up, or you can blow her off and take your old job back.\"Foreman said nothing, turned to House and took back his hospital badge.\"Welcome back,\" House said.Kutner was treating the priest when his blood pressure started rising and his chest appeared to be swelling. It was also covered in red spots.The doctors were going through more possible diagnoses when Thirteen suggested \"micro-tumors.\" Foreman jumped all over her, saying, after several back and forths, he thought she was wrong.\"This isn't going to work,\" Thirteen said.\"Are you kidding?\" House said. \"I've never felt more alive!

He erased \"hallucinations.\"He said it wasn't a symptom.House went to Bresson and told him he wasn't going to die. He said he had Wiscott-Aldridge Syndrome, which impaired his immune system and made him susceptible to the AIDS stuff without actually having the disease.\"You didn't catch it,\" House said. \"Another gift from God.\"The priest asked about the hallucination and House said, \"Scotch explains that.\"Daniel said, \"That was just a coincidence?\"\"Coincidences do happen,\" House said.\"But that coincidence is what brought me to you in the first place,\" Daniel said.\"You promised you wouldn't go there,\" House said.Bresson quoted Einstein, saying, \"Coincidences are God's way of remaining anonymous.\"\"A woman in Florida said, 'Look, Jesus is on my cheese sandwich.'\"Daniel reminded House he didn't even want to take the case in the first place.\"I'm just trying to understand how my life could completely turn around in a single day,\" Bresson said.House told him everything that happened to him could be rationally explained.\"I know,\" said Daniel. \"It just has a lot of coincidences.\"Cuddy and Cameron talked about House saving another life, even though he didn't really want to. Cameron knew Cuddy wanted House at her ceremony. \"You should tell him,\" Cameron said.Cuddy seemed like she was about to ask House to attend, but she didn't say anything as they walked out of the hospital and House said, \"Have fun.\"During a montage, accompanied by House's sweet, sweet piano playing (as he was home, alone), we saw Cuddy's ceremony taking place and Thirteen going home to see Foreman and taking a bow -- presumably in response to her acting display earlier. As we watched more bits of Cuddy's ceremony and House's piano playing grew louder and more intense, Cuddy excitedly answered the door, only to find more relatives. Then she shared a look with Wilson as they were a little sad House wasn't there.", "episode_4": "An Asian woman in her 20s approached an older Chinese couple in China (with a translator) to introduce herself as their daughter. They balked at the suggestion, claiming they had no daughter. She prayed to a Buddha statue for them to understand how much it meant to her that they acknowledge her as their daughter. As she tried to raise the statue a second time, she seized up, vomited what appeared to be blood and collapsed.House (Hugh Laurie) came in with news his dad died, but wanted to focus on the patient. The team wanted him to call his mom, but he refused. House noticed Taub's baggy eyes and knew Taub (Peter Jacobson) told his wife he'd cheated on her. He said she didn't kick him out, but they stayed up all night talking -- which he said was what House should be doing with his mom. Foreman (Omar Epps) offered to do the ultrasound on the patient so House could deal with his father's death. House said he \"didn't even like the man.\" He said he wasn't avoiding \"something deep,\" he was avoiding \"something shallow\".The patient's adoptive parents asked House if her drinking caused her illness. They'd found alcohol in her house and they thought she'd quit.Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) gave House her condolences for his father. She told House to go to Lexington to attend the funeral and deliver a eulogy.They decided the patient had SARS and put her in isolation. They gave everyone IV shots if they'd come in contact with her. She asked if House would be alright because she'd coughed on him. In the meantime, in his office, House collapsed. Back in isolation, the woman went into shock and Kutner (Kal Penn) realized her liver was failing. She didn't have SARS. Cut to House, in a car, waking up in a daze and finding that Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) was driving. Wilson said, \"I am not doing this because I care.\" House smiled.House realized Cuddy drugged him and that his mom called Wilson, not Cuddy. Wilson had taken House's Vicodin. He gave him one tablet. House's cell phone rang with Hanson's \"Mmm Bop\" as the tone. Wilson had his phone, but House said it was his team calling, so he should take the call. They had to figure out which genetic illness her parents handed down. House told Wilson his ring tone for him was \"Dancing Queen\" by ABBA.House said he could talk about the summer his dad decided he wasn't speaking to him. \"Two months, not one word. Anything he had to say, he typed up and slipped under my door,\" House said. Wilson told House to indulge his mom, who just wanted to think for one moment that she had a happy family. House demanded his cane and said he'd go to the funeral. Wilson gave it to him, House used it to knock Wilson's keys out of his hand and they fell into a grate. \"I said I would go to the funeral,\" House said. \"I didn't say when.\"Kutner lost the patient and found her outside smoking. He connected with her by telling her he was adopted by a white family when he was 9. He drew blood, but she started bleeding intensely.Wilson asked House to hold a flashlight while he fished for the keys with a wire hanger. House dropped the flashlight down the grate. Wilson, always prepared, had another one. Wilson told House he was just delaying and his mom would hold the funeral until they got there. House explained that his father was \"a punctual man. Two minutes late for dinner, you didn't eat.\" He said his mother wouldn't disrespect him by starting his funeral late. \"Yeah, you clearly have no issues to work through,\" Wilson said. Wilson got the keys.Cameron (Jennifer Morrison) tried to send flowers to House's mom, pretending they were from him. Wilson tried to explain to House he was biologically programmed to have some feelings for his father. House told Wilson his father wasn't his biological father. He gave some reasons why, but Wilson didn't believe him. House saw a cop car ahead on the highway and used his cane to press down the car's accelerator and speed past the cop, who pulled Wilson over.The team called House to tell him there was a mass on the patient's pancreas. Meanwhile, Wilson was getting arrested. House was next. The cop, Sheriff Costello (Lou Conley) explained there was a warrant for Wilson's arrest in Louisiana. Wilson looked unsurprised but annoyed.The team tried to figure out what House meant when he started to explain the mass was like a steamroller. House and Wilson sat in the police station and Wilson told him, \"You told me you'd taken care of this. First words you ever said to me.\" The charges were vandalism, destruction of property, assault. Wilson started to explain there was a medical convention in New Orleans. Wilson said aloud House was avoiding his father's funeral and the cop looked up. He wanted to hear the story.Wilson explained he'd set off a bar fight by throwing a glass at an antique mirror after someone wouldn't stop playing Billy Joel's \"Leave a Tender Moment Alone.\" House bailed him out even though he didn't know him, saying he was bored at the convention. Wilson realized the basis of their friendship was that House was bored one weekend. The cop said they could go because Louisiana didn't want to pay to get Wilson sent back. The cop told House to \"stop acting like such an ingrate and go pay your respects to your father.\"House and Wilson pulled up to the funeral home and his mother, Blythe (Diane Baker), said it was a load off her mind to see him there. She thanked Wilson for bringing him and told Wilson to stop looking so worried because she knew House would make her proud. \"You must know him better than I do,\" Wilson said. House insisted he wasn't going to speak, but when his mother called him up, she went.He went up and talked about how his father mistreated those over whom he had power. House said he was who he was because of his father. Then he went over to the open coffin, bent over and kissed his father on the forehead -- and clipped a piece of hair from his ear for his secret paternity test.In another part of the funeral home, Wilson and House fought over what the real issues were. Wilson was frustrated that House made Amber's death and his father's death about himself. House told Wilson that he, Wilson, was afraid of losing their friendship, which was why he walked away. He taunted Wilson, repeating, \"Admit it! Admit it!\" Until Wilson finally picked up a bottle of booze and hurled it through a stained-glass window. \"Still not boring,\" House said.House explained to Wilson he'd noticed back in New Orleans he'd been carrying around an express package but didn't open it. He knew Wilson's first wife had served Wilson with divorce papers. Bailing him out was the first nice thing House had done for him. House called for an update on the patient and they told him the ultrasound images were grainy. He said they weren't grainy images, the visual effect was the result of iron overload. He told them to do an MRI for a better view \"and call me and tell me you're embarrassed because my eyesight is better than yours 500 miles away.\"House called the village where the woman had gone to find her parents and the man she used as a translator told him he didn't think they were really her parents. He said the potential father was adamant they didn't have a daughter and the woman looked genuinely frightened. House and Wilson deduced the man had tried to kill the patient when she was born, which was when China's one-child policy was still in effect. As they broke down clues together, House told Wilson, \"This is fun.\"House realized the woman's father had stuck pins in her brain, but they didn't kill her. When she tried to lift the Buddha statue, there was a magnet inside that shifted positions and shifted one of the pins in her brain, causing her seizure and vomiting. Her adoptive parents wanted her not to know because she was fragile. Kutner showed them an X-ray of her brain, showing that one of the pins in her brain was pressing on her \"addiction center.\" He suggested that her alcoholism wasn't her fault.Wilson found House \"celebrating\" his DNA didn't match his father's. But he was depressed because it didn't make any difference."}}, "bbt": {"season_4": {"episode_11": "The guys discover that Penny and her ex-boyfriend, Zack (Brian Thomas Smith), are back together and they take advantage of his lack of intelligence and make fun of him.

Zack immediately forgives Leonard and his friends and goes with the guys to the comic book store, leaving a peeved Penny behind. At the store, the guys realize that Zack would be great as Superman for their Justice League group at Stuart's New Year's Eve costume party, who would replace the short Leonard in that role.Leonard agrees as long as he goes as Green Lantern, leaving Raj to be Aquaman, much to his distress. They return home with the Justice League costumes, with Howard being Batman, Raj as Aquaman, Sheldon as The Flash, and Leonard as Green Lantern. They even purchase a Wonder Woman costume for Penny.

None of them, not even Zack, are brave enough to stop the car theft.That New Year's Day evening, Leonard warns Sheldon that he wants to change the thermostat temperature.

Leonard helps distract him since Priya sneaked over from her brother's apartment to spend the night with Leonard. Leonard sneaks Priya in his room for the night.In the morning, after a lovely night with Priya, Leonard wonders if he should get a job in India so that they could date. Priya doesn't feel that that is a good idea since her parents prefer her with an Indian man. Still trying to hide from Sheldon, Leonard tries to distract him (with the ruse of a rash and asking Sheldon to find the right ointment for him), but he still catches her walking out. Leonard then asks Sheldon to conceal his violation of a 2005 pinkie swear with Howard.For Sheldon to keep a secret he must come up with a logical alternate explanation. He lies that Leonard went to a local Irish bar and hooked up with the fun loving and morally loose Ms. Maggie McGarry. She works at Lucky Baldwin's tending bar with a head full of curls and a heart full of dreams. Sheldon even has a phone number, an automated message and a lock of Maggie's auburn hair... from an orangutan in the university lab.Raj first worries about Priya ever being attracted to Howard and then asks Leonard about the new episode of \"Caprica\" which he missed due to his night with Priya. Leonard tries the Maggie McGarry alibi, but end up telling the truth.\nHe admits to Raj he slept with Priya with both Howard and Raj going ballistic. After Leonard told him he offered Priya his heart and she stepped on it, Raj felt much better. Then everyone starts exposing and confessing things better left unsaid such as Howard dropping Raj's IPhone into a urinal, Howard lying to Raj about foreigners giving present to Americans on Thanksgiving and washing their clothes on the 4th of July, Sheldon grinding up moths and mixing them in Leonard's food as an experiment, and Raj using Sheldon's toothbrush (much to Sheldon's disgust and horror) (he used the plastic handle to gently massage his gums). He nearly breaks his friendship with Raj, but forgives him when he learns that Raj bought him a talking Thomas the Tank Engine with real puffing smoke.Finally, Sheldon preparing snow cones and serving one to Leonard, and confessing they were made with mango caterpillar.

Amy is in one stall talks to Penny who is in the adjoining one. Amy explains that her previous trips to the toilet have mostly been about excreting, but now she can socialize too. Penny doesn't enjoy this socializing activity too much as she presumably suffers from bladder shyness.Next, the girls proceed to a shoe store, where Bernadette announces that she and Howard have been invited by Priya to dine with her and Leonard. Amy assumes Priya plans to test Bernadette's loyalty to the group but Amy wants Bernadette to attend the dinner as a double agent.Amy is hanging out at Penny's apartment and gets a text message confirming that Bernadette is at Raj's apartment dining with Priya, Leonard, and Howard. Bernadette soon alerts Amy and Penny about a snide comment Priya made about Penny's acting career. In retaliation, they lie about Penny shooting a movie with Angelina Jolie in Prague which will be shown in 3D. Leonard is surprised Penny didn't tell him this fact. Priya asks why he is surprised when he doesn't spend time with Penny, his ex-girlfriend. Leonard, who is now trapped between a rock and a hard place, is at a loss for words, but finally says he wasn't surprised, but \"befuddled\". Bernadette announces Penny is also dating an astronaut after she misreads a text saying \"architect\" from Amy and Penny.At apartment 4A, Sheldon is emulating three people as he tests out his three-person chess when, suddenly, Raj knocks on the door and says he needs a hug. Sheldon makes the excuse that he has company (his other two selves). After some deliberation, he lets Raj in who tells him he has received a new drug his friend claims to be \"the next big thing\" for people with social anxiety. Raj is worried that the side effects will affect his brain, which is a very important tool in his field. Sheldon reassures him as he believes Raj isn't that smart.Back at Raj's place, Howard is curious about how Penny met an astronaut. Bernadette tries to answer his question, but soon the lies falls apart and she gradually becomes crankier. Bernadette then heads to the toilet and calls Penny and Amy. She tells them about her dilemma about the lie falling apart. Bernadette mentions Leonard is going to India to meet Priya's parents.Raj and Sheldon go out to a coffee shop to test out the effects of the drug. Raj approaches a girl and stares at her silently for a moment. Eventually he is able to talk to her and they hit it off quite admirably. Sheldon takes his eyes off Raj for a moment-after Raj gives him a few dollars to buy a scone-and, when he looks at him again, Raj is already stripping. The woman leaves as Raj becomes completely nude; the Barrista is also shocked at Raj's behavior. The drug removed all his social inhibitions.Back at Raj's, Bernadette asks Priya about her and Leonard's trip to India. After establishing Priya is not getting engaged to Leonard, Bernadette tells Priya she is going to the bathroom, but her true intention is to update Penny and Amy. Priya notes that she has been in there a lot this evening and asks if she's okay. Bernadette breaks down and storms off, with Howard following. Priya is at a loss for words at her actions and Leonard says \"I think the word you are looking for is 'befuddled.'\"The final scene shows Leonard, Sheldon, and Howard playing a confusing game of three-person chess, and Raj, who is standing behind the counter completely naked, still under the effects of the drug.Title reference: Amy's metaphor about Bernadette being a \"weak wildebeest\".", "episode_2": "Sheldon works out that he won't live long enough to download his consciousness into a robot body. Elsewhere, Penny is low on funds to repay Leonard back for the Indian food, the pizza, the Thai food, the tank of gas, the frozen yogurt and her rent meaning she owes over $1,400. On the night Sheldon announces Cruciferous vegetable night (as he wants to improve his lifespan by changing his diet to healthy), and the next night where he introduces his MVPD (Mobile Virtual Presence Device), Howard and Raj make jokes about Penny living a free life without money, which only annoys Penny. Finally, she scares them off making jokes forever by sarcastically offering to sell her underwear for $1,400.Sheldon determines that his best estimate for his life expectancy will cause him to miss, by only a few years, \"the singularity... when man will be able to transfer his consciousness into machines, and achieve immortality\". He therefore changes his diet and starts to exercise in hopes of extending his life expectancy. Since the diet of Brussels sprouts gives him a bad case of flatulence (he scares Leonard late at night as the abdomen pain looked like appendicitis but got cured after a nice long fart), and he tumbles on the stairs going down for a jog, Sheldon decides on an alternate plan to extend his life expectancy.He builds a robotic replication of himself which he calls a \"Mobile Virtual Presence Device\" (MVPD) that would go through all the hazards of life that Sheldon would otherwise have to experience while he stays behind in a \"secure, undisclosed location\" (his room). The MVPD has a monitor showing Sheldon's face in real-time (or any other image that he wants to display at that moment), speakers so his voice can be heard, and a microphone and camera to allow him to see and hear in his \"secure, undisclosed location\" (his bedroom) what is happening at the MVPD's location. Sheldon can then react to the situation as if he was present (to the point of enforcing the rule that nobody sits on \"his spot\" on the sofa). The monitor sits on top of a fixture covered with the exact same clothing that Sheldon is wearing that day. The MVPD has wheels which give it mobility and comes with an override switch so if anybody turns the MVPD off, Sheldon can override and turn the monitor back on.The guys dismiss the MVPD as a stunt (Penny calls it \"Shelbot\") and try to convince Sheldon to drop the idea, but he persists and proceeds to cite Section 74c of The Roommate Agreement requiring Leonard to assist him (by providing him transportation) \"in the event one of [the roommates] becomes a robot.\" Leonard therefore takes the MVPD to work, though he regrets it, and later to Penny's restaurant for dinner.At the restaurant, Sheldon's MVPD spots Steve Wozniak at a nearby table so he sends the MVPD over to meet Woz, telling him that he has a vintage Apple II computer, to which Wozniak says that if he had the Apple II there he would sign it. Sheldon then takes his Apple II and rushes out of the apartment, but trips and falls down the stairs, breaking the Apple II.Later, Sheldon's MPVD goes to Penny's apartment door to help him fall asleep after the aftermath of falling down the stairs and the demise of his Apple II. He wants her to sing him a song to go to sleep by. At first she is reluctant, but he soon convinces her to do so. Sheldon plays \"Soft Kitty\" on his recorder while Penny sings.Title reference: The Cruciferous vegetables that Sheldon adds to his diet which give him a major case of flatulence.", "episode_15": "The gang is eating and chatting at the cafeteria, and, unexpectedly, the president of the university, President Siebert (Joshua Malina), approaches them and asks them to attend a fundraiser for the university.

At the fundraiser, President Siebert approaches the trio and introduces them to Mrs. Latham (Jessica Walter). Mrs. Latham's condescending attitude terrifies the trio.\nWhile Sheldon is video chatting with Amy, she alerts him that if he is not at the fundraiser, the others may fail and the funds will go to other departments including the geology and the liberal arts, which is unacceptable to Sheldon. Later, Mrs. Latham explains to Leonard that she actually comes to the fundraiser to make smart people feel uncomfortable. Meanwhile, Sheldon shows up at the fundraiser and is terrorizing the donors by acting weird and refusing to shake hands with them.The following morning, Sheldon gets a phone call from President Siebert telling him to stay away from fundraisers.

Leonard makes an excuse and goes home, but is invited to another dinner the following day. After Leonard had arrived home, he explained to the gang what happened at dinner.

Since they need money for the equipment, Sheldon asks Leonard to proceed with \"trading sexual favor for material gain\" just like Penny does. And that's a compliment.The next night, Sheldon gives Leonard a box containing condoms, Viagra, baby oil, and a picture of Mrs. Latham as a 25 year old. Leonard says he won't prostitute himself. On the date, Mrs. Latham expressed her apology for the night before as she made him feel the relationship had taken a Quid Pro Quo turn.

Failing that, Sheldon tries to hinder the team's progress and make a nuisance of himself by playing his noisy theremin in front of them, which results in him getting kicked out of the apartment.Penny finds Sheldon playing the theremin at the hallway and tells him about her idea for an app that help user find places on the Internet to buy shoes (by taking photos of people wearing them and then using the app to find out where you could buy them on the internet) which Sheldon turns down. Feeling sympathy for him she invites him for hot cocoa (without marshmallows), and he accepts with the remark \"A disappointing drink for a disappointing day\", a decision which she soon regrets. Leonard agrees that he will let Sheldon back on the team and into the apartment if Penny is able to make Sheldon apologize, thinking it was impossible. Penny manages to do it by telling Sheldon to perform his apology with sarcasm (while also lying to him by claiming that the others desperately need his help). After a brief period back in the team, Sheldon is kicked off again and is seen in the last scene making an algorithm for Penny's shoe finder app.Title reference: A pair of pants that Sheldon wears when riding on buses to protect his regular pants from dirty bus seats.", "episode_16": "While Howard and Bernadette are recovering from their amorous bedroom activities, she asks Howard if he wanted to move in with her.

Howard leaves angry and ends up bunking at Leonard's place. Sheldon wants Leonard to offer the upset Howard a hot beverage because he is upset. Then Sheldon asks why he didn't go to Raj's, he finds out that Priya is back. Leonard leaves to visit her while Sheldon go to make Howard some tea and let him Narcissistically ramble on about whatever is troubling him.Leonard arrives and Raj forbids him from talking to Priya. They ignore him and disappear into his bedroom with Raj still forbidding it. Finally, he ends up calling them both, but he only gets their voice mails. Raj tells Leonard to call him, and then he tells Priya to have Leonard check his voice mail.Leonard and Priya walk into the Cheesecake Factory and announce that they are going to start seeing each other. Raj begs Penny to tell Priya all of Leonard's love making problems. Howard offers to spend two nights with Bernadette since his mother is going to Palm Springs, California. Bernadette wants a commitment from Howard and to choose between his mother and her.Amy rushes over to Penny's place when Sheldon told her Leonard was dating Priya. She wanted to console Penny and help pick up the pieces of her broken heart that Penny said wasn't necessary. Amy still wanted to be strong for me and talk about Priya, that man-stealing bitch. Amy pointed out Penny's former boyfriend replaced her with a mate more suitable than she was. Priya was highly educated and came from the land that invented neat ways to have sex. Penny is a community-college dropout whose people wrote the book on tipping cows.At Bernadette's, she answers her door and finds Howard has brought over a ton of luggage since he moved out of his mother's place. He tells her that he chooses her and that he left his mother an email. They both tell each other, \"I love you,\" then Howard suggests they go make love in their bedroom. As they are walking to the bedroom he asks, wants to know what's for dinner. Since she didn't have a lot in the apartment, Howard was going to send her to the store.

Amy invites her 'bestie' to sit next to her on the chair. Priya talks about being an international lawyer.

Priya and Leonard then end up quoting a few lines from \"The Taming of the Shrew\" to Amy's delight and Penny's jealousy.Howard and Bernadette's living arrangement doesn't seem to be working out. Howard asks for a snack, and tells her about his hypoallergenic laundry needs and that she needs to take him to the dentist. Bernadette is not going to take the place of Howard's mother so Howard heads back home.Amy again checks in on Penny. Now she describes Priya as a \"smart, beautiful woman with the smoldering sexuality of a crouched Bengal tiger.\" Penny still says that she is fine, but now breaks into tears. Amy gave her a hug and whipped out the electrodes to record on her brain activity.Another day, Penny went to over to Apartment 4A when she smelled Chinese food. First she is happy that Priya and Leonard weren't there, as they are spending the weekend at Catalina. It's revealed that Raj is at home forbidding the couple from dating, and Howard was (according to Sheldon), grounded by his mother for \"running away\" from home. Sheldon is still eating with three of them since Amy is on video conference. Amy asked if Penny was feeling better. Also Amy was able to use Penny's brainwave patterns to make a rhesus monkey cry like a disgraced televangelist. And Amy also sent Sheldon for the tea, since Penny was still upset.

The guys are going to the upcoming midnight showing of the movie, complete with twenty-one extra seconds of footage which will explain the submarine controversy.\nLeonard cannot believe she had never seen Raiders until now. Penny retorts that she cannot believe that Leonard has never read Eat, Pray, Love. Raj has read it and it changed his life.At the Cheesecake Factory on the day of the showing, Sheldon is panicking the movie is only seven hours away and they have to get in line. After Howard mocks Sheldon, he feels that as his roommate, Leonard should back him up. When Leonard fails to help, Sheldon wonders what happened to the Leonard Hofstadter who waited in line with him for fourteen hours to see the midnight premiere of Star Trek: Nemesis. Leonard replies that he waited for the whole fourteen hours as Sheldon napped; that he got into a fight with a Klingon and, worst of all, they had to watch the terrible movie.\nAmy tries to be more accepted in his social group by agreeing with everybody else. After Bernadette gets cute with Howard, she mentions her girl's night with Penny. Amy tells her that she is a girl too and proceeds to get herself invited. She feels that she and Penny are best friends and Penny nonchalantly agrees, though she has to go shopping for something comfortable to wear.As it turns out, Sheldon was right and the line is ridiculously long. To make matters worse, Wil Wheaton, \"the Jar-Jar Binks of the Star Trek universe\", shows up with his friends from the comic book store. The bouncer is a big fan and he immediately let them into the theater.At Penny's apartment, Amy is describing her unusually firm cervix and a tilted uterus, as she does not quite understand the concept of \"girl talk\". As Penny shows Bernadette her new manicure, Amy starts talking about her friend's thesis on the fungus that grows on manicure implement. Penny reaches for the next bottle of wine. Bernadette suggests they'll have to make it a slumber party. Amy adds that they'll do makeovers, initiate phony phone calls, and \"have spirited pillow fights in our frilly nighties!\" Penny reluctantly agrees and immediately gets a pillow in the face from Amy.Back in line at the cinema, Sheldon reads Wil Wheaton's tweet: \"Best seats in the house for \"Raiders\" screening. Suck on that, Sheldon Cooper.\" Then he gets a call on his phone to test its quality using test phrases. \"Imatote. Ulbu. Twad. All together? 'I'm a total butt-wad.' Why are you laughing?\" It was Penny making a phony phone call.Later, she gives Amy a manicure which makes her nails look prettier than they have ever been. Then she makes her take it off. The next game is \"Truth or Dare\". Amy asks Bernadette a question about killing bacteria in beef followed by asking her the circumference of her Areolas.The bouncer cuts the guys off just as they reach the theater, and sends everybody else home. Sheldon starts complaining until he sees an open door at the side, and runs in, stealing the movie print from the unguarded projection room: \"If I can't see it, no one else can see it.\" Wil Wheaton finds Sheldon in his act of thievery and he leads the whole theater after Sheldon and the guys reminiscent of Indiana Jones' race to his pontoon plane in Raiders with appropriate background music.Amy is finishing telling \"The Miller's Tale\" by Chaucer in the original Middle English which was the dirtiest story she knew. Bernadette had dared her to tell one. Bernadette then asks Penny why she hangs out with Leonard even though they broke up. Penny explains that just because they're not seeing each other anymore doesn't mean we can't be friends. He got too serious and she wasn't ready for it.\nThen they ask her if she is ready for it in the future how she feel if she was with someone else since he is \"a great guy\"; however, Amy and Bernadette have gone too far. Penny doesn't want to play the game anymore and leaves, upset. Amy thinks that they've won the game.Much later, Amy wants to find another game since Penny is still upset. Her list includes eating raw cookie dough or experimental lesbianism. Amy enters Penny's bedroom as Penny first greets and then screams asking her, \"What are you doing?\".

Since their pizza finally arrives, Leonard goes over to get Penny. An older man answers the door who ends up to be her visiting father. She then tells him good-bye giving him an intense kiss.Back in the apartment, Raj and Howard are discussing using the telescope lab for twelve hours, but they need several more hours of comic book reading material. They can also play Indian Monopoly and Intergalactic Battleship. Sheldon only prefers the classic styles of Monopoly: regular and Klingon. Leonard returns with this story about Penny kissing him. The guys figure her lips missed the mark or she is being held hostage.Penny comes over and explains that she told her father Wyatt (Keith Carradine) they got back together because he was so upset when they broke up in the first place. Leonard was the first guy Penny dated with a college degree...or a real job...or without a neck tattoo...or with no outstanding warrants...or without a baby...or never tipped a cow over on himself. Leonard is a bit offended, but is willing to kiss her to make it look like they were together. Her father shows up and he over does the kissing which embarrasses Penny. Leonard ends up with a dinner invitation, despite Penny's reluctance.At the university, Bernadette joins Howard and Raj much to Raj's discomfort. He drinks some wine so he can at least talk to her. Howard wants his best friend and girlfriend to bond like he did with his mother.Coming back from dinner Wyatt, Penny's father, keeps telling old boyfriend stories which upsets Penny. Back at her apartment, Penny does get Leonard to go home, but not without Leonard getting her to say \"I love you\", like she couldn't do the previous season. Their kiss is witnessed by Sheldon who is not thrilled that all that nonsense seemed to be restarting.As Raj consumes more wine, he really bonds with Bernadette at Howard's expense making jokes about him and his mother. Bernadette imitates Howard's mother which later is found to be part of her normal personality.Penny storms over to Leonard's apartment mad at him because her father can't stop praising her boyfriend.

Leonard cautioned her not to let Sheldon in on their deception.Raj is very drunk and is pulling pranks on the telescope team he is working with. Then he complains to Bernadette that no one wants to kiss him. She tells Raj he's a very cute guy and plenty of girls would want to kiss him. He tries to kiss Bernadette, and Howard tries to intercept him inadvertently receiving his kiss.Leonard and Wyatt are enjoying some Wii fishing when Penny calls him to tell him the truth (Apparently, Leonard pushed Penny too far). Wyatt is angry that his daughter doesn't respect him enough to tell him the truth. She apologizes and goes to change to take him to the airport. When it looks like Wyatt is going to turn his full wrath on Leonard, he ends up begging Leonard to take Penny back. He is tired of her former suitors and wants to have grand-kids that grow up in a house without wheels. Then for Penny's benefit, he tells Leonard that he doesn't want to see his lying ass again.\nSheldon tells him he was up all night altering the Penny-specific sections of the roommate agreement and Leonard tells him they broke up again.The next morning, Raj and Howard were very vague about their previous night's experience and Raj got huffy when asked if Howard got to play with his big telescope.Title reference: Leonard pretending to be Penny's boyfriend to please her father.", "episode_3": "Sheldon and Amy have created a game called \"Counter Factuals,\" where they postulate a situation in the world that currently doesn't exist and pose questions to each other. The game can only be played by them because it requires that you know how the other person thinks thus proving that they are very compatible together. Leonard tries the game and fails miserably. Asked that in a world where mankind is ruled by a giant, intelligent beaver, what food is no longer consumed? Leonard's answer is cinnamon, but the correct one is cheese Danish. Since the people would build many dams to appease their overlord and flood the city of Copenhagen, devastating the Danish people enough to never invent their namesake pastry.At the Cheesecake Factory, Howard and Raj are discussing the term \"toilet\" at the dinner table when Sheldon and Amy arrive. Amy had stop to get some feminine hygiene supplies, since she wears them all the time to avoid being surprised. Penny comes over and calls the couple \"Shamy\" which Amy does not like. Asking how everything is going, Amy replies it's the same as everybody else's: subject to entropy, decay, and eventual death. Leonard gets described as a \"festival of humdrum chitchat.\" Howard only has a master's degree, so he's beneath her, and Raj luckily can't talk in front of women.Leonard wants Sheldon to spend time with his girlfriend (\"She's not my girlfriend!\") elsewhere since she is judgmental, sanctimonious, and obnoxious just like Sheldon. But Sheldon points out that he suffered in silence for eight months of Penny's country music, rubbing her feet with a pumice stone, and poor documentaries about the Jersey Shore. Leonard reacts that he did not suffer in silence.They try meeting in Penny's apartment as Howard insists on correcting Penny's use of the pumice stone and Raj insists on getting drunk and acting like a jerk.At the cafeteria the next day, Leonard, Howard, and a hung over Raj are joined by John Lennon and Yoko Ono (\"more like Yoko and Yoko,\" according to Howard) or Shamy as Amy has been given a tour. Amy thinks it's very impressive for theoretical work as opposed to the real-world applications of Neuro-Biology, she finds theoretical physics 'cute'. She claims that Neuro-Biology is a higher science than physics. Sheldon is appalled and says that they should end their relationship immediately. Amy agrees and then leaves.Penny finds Sheldon in the laundry and asks how he is doing after his breakup with his girlfriend; however, Sheldon once again states that Amy is not his girlfriend. Sheldon assures her that his relationship with Amy was purely intellectual.Leonard returns home to find that Sheldon has gotten himself a cat which he takes everywhere, even to work. The cat is named Dr. Robert Oppenheimer after the Los Alamos atomic scientist. Later Leonard finds him with six more cats. They are named after other Manhattan project scientists and were needed because Dr. Robert Oppenheimer was lonely. Zazzles is his favorite because he is so \"zazzy.\" It's time for intervention so Leonard sends for Sheldon's mother.Mary Cooper arrives and she first verifies that Sheldon had a real girlfriend and not something the boys cooked up in the lab. Upon entering Sheldon's bedroom, the normally unflappable Mary Cooper sees him with twenty-five cats. She tells Leonard that he should have called her sooner.Mary Cooper makes dinner for the gang, but doesn't allow him to bring in any of his cats. Sheldon finds Amy as a guest who came because Sheldon was losing his mind over her and she wanted to see that. Mary Cooper found Amy a perfectly \"unique\" young lady and that it was good that they broke up because they were not suited for each other. Otherwise, she would have to have broken them up on her own. Sheldon objects, saying that Amy was more like him than anyone else he has met and they agree to resume their relationship. After Amy's suggestion, he agrees that 65% of their problems were his fault and he takes her off to show her his cats. She's elated, as cats are the epitome of indifference.\nLeonard correctly guesses Mrs. Cooper was using some reverse psychology on Sheldon. Mrs. Cooper insists that despite Sheldon's intelligence he acts like any other man when it comes to reverse psychology, citing that her brother \"Stumpy\" would still be called \"Edward\" if she hadn't told him to clean a wood-chipper by hand. Then she uses the same technique to get Leonard to bring over the food.Finally, Sheldon and Amy are seen giving away the cats on a table marked \"Cats $20,\" though they are not selling the cats; they are in fact paying people twenty dollars to take the cats away.Title reference: Sheldon describes one of his cats as being very \"zazzy\", and he uses his cats to fill the void created by the breakup with Amy.", "episode_24": "Leonard, Sheldon, Howard, Raj, and Priya are at The Cheesecake Factory.

He is troubled by these activities, leaves, and attempts to sleep at Howard's, but Mrs. Wolowitz and her hormone replacement therapy make him uncomfortable.Sheldon is video chatting with Amy when he hears a knock on his apartment door. It's Raj wanting to crash on Leonard's bed. Sheldon discourages it, but finally gives in and asks Raj to sign a waiver and gives him a safety drill. The next morning, Leonard enters his room and sits on his bed; to his surprise he discovers Raj sleeping in it. Raj explains his predicament and asks why Leonard can't sleep with Priya at his apartment, but Leonard says that she doesn't get along with Sheldon. He suggests that until Priya gets her own place in Los Angeles, Raj can stay at Leonard's and Vice Versa. Raj asks if he can bring girls to Leonard's room, and he agrees because he believes that Raj can't score with a girl and as long as they are there on their own free will.Later on, Raj gets Thai food, arranges it like a fancy dinner, and calls over Sheldon, who is amazed by the presentation. Penny comes over to ask if Sheldon changed his Wi-Fi password (the new one now being \"pennygetyourownwifi\"; no spaces), and she can't help but notice the fancy dinner. Sheldon tells her that Raj has replaced Leonard temporarily and that Leonard is now living with Priya.Howard and Bernadette are in bed together and Bernadette tells him that she got him a present. He opens it and it to find an expensive Rolex watch, and after the teasing from his friends they begin to argue.Back at the apartment, Sheldon, Penny, and Raj are drinking and having dinner together. After Sheldon leaves to go to bed, Penny continues to talk to Raj, revealing her true feelings for Leonard and admitting that she never should have broken up with him, leaving Raj a little sad. In an attempt to comfort her, Raj tells her that her life is better than his of Internet downloading porn every night.Leonard and Priya are making out when her parents call her for a video chat. Priya quickly asks him to go away so her parents don't spot him. Leonard overhears that Priya's moving back to India, he feels betrayed and, in the spur of the moment, he reveals himself by telling Priya's parents that they are dating.The next morning, Penny wakes up and discovers that she slept in the same bed as Raj and to her horror realizes that she had sex with him. She tells him to act as if this never happened, he just nods as he still can't speak to her sober, which annoys her since they had slept together.Sheldon wakes up and finds Leonard on the couch, moping about Priya leaving for India and breaking up with him. Howard arrives at the door as he had a big fight with Bernadette because of the watch. Suddenly, Penny does the \"walk of shame\" out of Leonard's room with Raj close behind her, wrapped in a duvet.

Sheldon then asks without a clue, \"What does it look like?\"Title reference: Raj becoming Sheldon's new roommate.", "episode_10": "While eating their take-out dinner around the coffee table, Sheldon complains that the next person who ate with their mouth full will be put to death. This comment is followed later by Sheldon asking what everyone thought the best number was. Not 5,318,008, as suggested by Raj, since upside-down on a calculator it spells \"Boobies\". Sheldon explains that the best number is 73 because 73 is the 21st prime number. Its mirror, 37, is the 12th and its mirror, 21, is the product of multiplying 7 and 3... and in binary 73 is a palindrome, 1001001, which backwards is 1001001.Amy, Bernadette and Penny are spending their night out together at a bar. Bernadette loves the heart-shaped locket Howard gave her after yet another night of enduring his mother. Amy provides a factoid that the iconic Valentine's heart shape is not based on a human heart, but rather the shape of the buttocks of a female bending over. Penny's ex-boyfriend, Zack, stops by to drop off menus, and says \"Hi\". Actually, Amy let's out an involuntary \"Hoo!\" a couple of times, including when Zack bent over to pick up a box. Penny knows what is bothering Amy, but she misses that she is aroused.Howard and Raj find out a lab tech got bitten by a rat that was injected with radioactive isotopes. They wonder which of them would be the better Rat-man and which could be his sidekick. Leonard is unhappy at still being at the nerds' table.Amy is slicing up pieces of a human brain and having lunch with Sheldon. They try to analyze the symptoms she had the previous night. Raised temperature, sweaty palms, and vascular throbbing in her ears and genitalia. Sheldon reduces the causes to hyperthyroidism, premature menopause, an alien parasite, or sexual arousal. Amy eliminates hyperthyroidism & menopause. Amy and Sheldon must face the cold, harsh truth that she was sexually aroused by Penny's friend, Zack. Sheldon prefers the alien parasite hypothesis. To handle her condition, he suggests Star Trek and the teachings of the Vulcan way of Kolinahr. Amy wonders why she should use advice from some cheap science fiction show. Sheldon uses Kolinahr to suppress his anger at Amy and then leaves accidentally mistaking her brain slices for his lunch.Howard wants the sidekick argument with Raj settled, so he puts a giant spider in a large jar and wants both of them to put one hand in the jar. First one to pull out his hand is destined to be the sidekick. Raj put his hand in and smiles because the spider was crawling up Howard's arm. Next they decide on a wrestling contest. Leonard is the judge as they spend the whole night circling and trash-talking each other.Sheldon heads down to do laundry and runs into Penny. He starts to talk about this relationship with Amy which he thought was a purely intellectual one. She has changed and had become a slave to her baser urges...like Penny. Penny asks what the right scientific word was. Sheldon replies, \"Forget science; she's horny.\" Penny tells Sheldon that he can help her with those urges. (\"It's illegal to spay a human being!\") Then he jumps to a conclusion and figures he might as well get it over with. Penny thinks Sheldon going to satisfy Amy himself, but he decides to get Zack to do it.Zack meets them in the same bar and Amy approaches him saying, \"I stand here before you, 130 pounds of raging estrogen, longing to grab your hold of your Gluteus Maximus and make Shakespeare's metaphorical Beast with Two Backs.\" Zack is confused as usual. (\"My Gluteus what?\") Based upon his ape-like expression, she decide to start using Vulcan disciplinary practice of Kolinahr for her urges, though there is one more \"Hoo!\" before she leaves. Outside the bar, she does try holding Sheldon's hand though she doesn't feel anything.Title reference: One of Sheldon's theories about why Amy had her symptoms, which he thinks is more likely than her being sexually aroused.", "episode_5": "Sheldon and Leonard are enjoying a movie on the couch. Leonard wants to know why Sheldon isn't hanging out with Amy Farrah Fowler. Sheldon doesn't feel the need to have closeness. He does point out that he's in a relationship (with a girl, who's a friend, who's not his girlfriend) while Leonard is not.At the comic book store, Leonard feels even more lonely when Howard's new ringtone (Bernadette by The Four Tops) goes off for a call from his girlfriend. Raj found the solution by getting a girl who is deaf. Even Stuart has a girl who wears a plus-size Wonder Woman costume.Back in Apartment 4A, perhaps Leonard's psychological state is producing a Pheromonal \"stink of desperation\" per Amy's theory, who is in Skyping with Sheldon while Leonard was sleeping on the couch. Amy suggests a bar for Leonard, but Sheldon correctly points out picking up women in a bar requires feats of manliness, strength, and the ability to hold down liquor and/or throw darts, but also remarks that juice bars, salad bars, and sushi bars might be more Leonard's speed. Leonard has had enough and leaves.\nAmy then asks Sheldon if he'll meet her mother. Sheldon races down the stairs after Leonard to ask him what it means. Leonard responses with, \"Well, you know how you're always saying Amy's a girl who's your friend, but not your girlfriend?\" He can't say that anymore.\nSheldon doesn't want to take his relationship with Amy to the next level so Sheldon says that Leonard can have her since he wants a girlfriend. Leonard turns him down which is just as well, since Amy finds Leonard very tedious.Leonard fails at picking up women at the Genius Bar by wearing an Apple computer shirt. After not working, he ends up at Howard's house and invokes the \"girlfriend pact\" with Howard to get Bernadette to fix him up with someone.Sheldon is working on removing his digital footprint from the Internet to hide from Amy. He also changed the building street address number on the front of the building. Of course, Amy's been there before. In fact, she knocks at their front door. Sheldon tells Leonard to makes sure he has a good lie ready. Leonard just tells Amy he's not there and Amy immediately leaves.Bernadette's friend, Joy (Charlotte Newhouse), arrives from her spin class all sweaty in her gym clothes. She's thinks that she is hilarious and keeps describing the 100 ways she has learned from her defense class to pulls a guy's nuts off, and she needs to use her napkin to dry her armpits. Leonard tells Howard that this night was just about the worse date he ever had. Joy asks him to her cousin's wedding the following weekend, and says that since there would be an open bar she would likely 'be giving it away'. Convinced, he tells her that he's in.Sheldon wants to head out for the night, only Amy is in the lobby. He tries going down in disguise, but Amy sees right through it. She tells him that he may have misconstrued her intention. She was only introducing Sheldon to get her mother off her back and they were going to perpetrate a ruse. They Skype with her mother (Annie O'Donnell), and Sheldon assures her he's having lots of sex with her, which scares her mother. They quickly say good-bye because their loins burn for each other. Sheldon suggests that maybe they should try and have sex. After a brief pause, he says \"Bazinga!\" making it clear that he was joking. It was bedtime so he told Amy that she knew the way out.Title reference: Leonard's desperation in wanting a girlfriend.", "episode_7": "Leonard decides that to attract women he has to exude confidence. Sheldon wants to talk about Capybara rodents. When Leonard demonstrates his new act (of confidence in talking to women), Raj is impressed. Howard walks in to tell about his new project with the Department of Defense which requires him to have a top level security clearance. He used the three of them as references and the F.B.I. Raj is naturally scared, as he thinks it could be a one-way trip back to Gandhi-Ville.Raj is at home reading \"New Moon\" and is interrupted by F.B.I. Special Agent Angela Page (Eliza Dushku), a beautiful and formidable woman. The conversation starts out a bit muted until Raj liquors up with some rum cake. Raj has known Howard for seven years, never committed a felony, and his only known foreign contact is Raj. Suddenly Raj becomes completely paranoid that she will have him deported back to India. He goes on how he loves America to the confusion of Agent Page.Next Leonard is visited by Agent Page who decides to come on to her with his new confidence act whipping off his eyeglasses. He was glad to get Scully instead of Mulder; however, Agent Page does not know the \"X-Files\" series. Leonard tells her that she pops, sparkles, and buzzes electric and that he'll pick her up at 8. She agrees and asks if she can bring along her 6' 2\" Navy SEAL husband. He missed seeing her wedding ring or anything without his glasses on.When she visits Sheldon, he naturally doesn't trust her, despite Agent Page showing her badge. Sheldon has a Justice League ID card, but it doesn't mean he knows Batman. Finally he asks her the F.B.I. motto (fidelity, bravery, integrity) which convinces Sheldon. Agent Page asks if he considers Howard responsible. Sheldon shows her his 9-disc Blu-Ray edition of \"The Lord of the Rings\", in which Howard accidentally damaged one of the plastic retention hubs and didn't tell him. He also changed one of his World of Warcraft characters from \"Sheldor\" to \"Smelldor\", insisted Sheldon go see the third \"Matrix\" movie, crashed the Mars rover to impress a woman, .... Oops! Agent Page made note of that comment. Sheldon wants to retract it since it didn't involve him.Next day, Howard confronts the gang because he didn't get his security clearance and can't work on the DoD project. Raj confesses he was drunk on rum cake and Leonard admitted to hitting on her. Sheldon doesn't say a thing, but is clearly upset.

Sheldon wakes up abruptly.Sheldon tries to talk to Agent Page, but she refuses to change her findings and the matter is closed. Sheldon starts to read a poem he wrote praising Howard. (H is for ...) She stops him making him frustrated and he starts to talk about Leonard almost giving away rocket secrets to a North Korean spy. She starts taking notes and asks if that's Leonard Hofstadter. Sheldon leaves after telling her, \"No, this was a different Leonard, Chinese, red hair, six fingers...\"Sheldon finally goes to Howard to apologize; however, Howard is greatly offended since he set Howard's career back at least two years. He won't accept his apology.Sheldon goes to the Cheesecake Factory bar to pour out his troubles to the local barkeeper, Penny. After asking for just alcohol, he checks his phone app and requests a Rosewater Rickey. Penny doesn't have the exotic ingredients and just pours him a shot claiming that that is the way she makes them. Sheldon takes it and then spits it out. Since this situation seems like a no-win scenario, Sheldon brings up the Star Trek Kobayashi Maru scenario, which Penny correctly points out that Captain James T. Kirk won it by cheating and reprogramming the test. She inspires Sheldon to go and try to reprogram Howard.In the cafeteria, Sheldon tries to convince Howard to accept his apology using Neuro-Linguistic programming. Since that fails, he bribes him by giving Howard his spot (Cushion) on the couch. Knowing how much that means to Sheldon, Howard does finally accept his apology.

He further informs her that they are going to be late and need to hurry. Penny inquires as to whether Leonard actually said \"cockamamie.\" Sheldon said that he grew up in a Christian home and was uncomfortable repeating the language Leonard actually used. To that Penny said, \"Well, let me get my cockamamie keys.\"Meanwhile, Howard continues experimenting with the robotic arm, using it as a massage device. He makes a comment about it feeling just like a real hand, then has an epiphany when he thinks of something else he could have his robotic arm do.\nPenny picks Amy up and the car turns silent, so Penny tries to start a conversation. She is taken aback by Amy's stubbornness, akin to Sheldon's, and all of her attempts to make conversation fail.Meanwhile, Howard tries to use the robotic arm to masturbate, and gets his genitals stuck in an awkward position. He calls Leonard and Raj (Kunal Nayyar) for help, and lies to them that he accidentally slipped over the arm. Leonard and Raj don't believe him and, finding the situation funny, offer many ridiculous solutions to the complete frustration of Howard.Penny, Sheldon and Amy go to a restaurant where Penny tries to bring up conversations between them including the topic of tonight being Sheldon's first date. Her attempts fail and to her annoyance, Sheldon calculates the number of dates that Penny might have had in her life by extrapolating the data he collected over the past three years. He comes up with a number: 193. Amy wonders if Penny has had sex with all these men, to which Sheldon believes is a possibility. He then proceeds to calculate the number of cases that might have resulted in sexual encounters and gets the number: 31. Penny, feeling so embarrassed, thinks she might need a drink. To add to this, Amy asks her whether she ever felt like a \"s**t.\" Penny denies it twice and then is not so sure about herself the third time she says no. Amy admits to having had many more orgasms during experiments by having the pleasure centers of her brain stimulated.Leonard and Raj take Howard to the hospital emergency room (previously seen in The Peanut Reaction) along with the robotic arm. The nurse, Althea (Vernee Watson), turns off the computer that controlled the arm, and Howard is freed. He was worried if the program was activated again, that the hand would start twisting, thinking it was holding a screwdriver.Finally, Penny convinces Sheldon to drop his plans to have an In-Vitro fertilization with Amy after threatening to tell his religious mother about an out-of-wedlock test tube grandchild.\nHoward calls Leonard again, saying he is \"stuck again\".Title reference: Howard's use of a robotic arm for masturbation.", "episode_23": "The gang (except Amy) is at The Cheesecake Factory. Penny asks Bernadette to take their table for her, because she doesn't want to speak to Priya. At the table Sheldon is drinking water, only to be informed that it was already drunk by Leonard, causing him to worry about germs.Before or after the theme song, Bernadette comes back with everyone's order; Priya asks if she and Howard have started planning their wedding, and if they have told Howard's mother. Bernadette says he is waiting for the right time, which Howard clarifies to be some time after his mother's funeral. Sheldon returns to the table after accidentally swallowing tequila in an attempt to gargle it to kill the germs from Leonard drinking from his water glass.Back at the apartment, the boys are playing Mystic Warlords of Ka'a and Raj is annoyingly commenting on every card played, during which Howard gets a text informing him that his mother has arrived at the deli for a \"get to know\" lunch with Bernadette. After Sheldon drinks some water Raj tells him is his, Sheldon panics and dashes to the bathroom to search for the mouthwash (to kill the germs) which Raj has hidden. Leonard points out that the drink Raj claimed was his is actually Sheldon's, but Raj knew that. He also hid the mouthwash to mess with him further.Howard arrives home and searches for his mother, who is in the bathroom. He asks, through the door, how the lunch went, and is told that Bernadette is \"a lovely girl, cute as a button\". He then announces to her that he is getting married to Bernadette. His mother doesn't respond and suddenly he hears a thud as if she has fallen off the seat.Penny and Sheldon are chatting in the laundry room; she is amused by his \"jibber jabber\" because she's been keeping her distance from the gang because of Priya. Leonard bursts in with news that Howard's mother has been taken to the hospital, and asks them both to go there with him. Sheldon is reluctant, but then agrees to after Penny points out that he has no characteristics of a hero despite him liking them.At the hospital waiting room, Howard explains that he carried his mother out of the bathroom after breaking down the door (injuring his shoulder), put her in his car, and drove like a mad man to the emergency room. He suspects it is heart-related and explains that his family has a deep heart disease history. Bernadette figures out that Mrs. Wolowitz may have had a heart attack after hearing that Howard is getting married to her.Priya praises Penny for being there for Howard, and Penny acknowledges Howard as a friend, which Priya finds weird when Penny tells her about breaking Howard's nose in The Killer Robot Instability. Priya also tells her that Raj has a bunch of friends in New Delhi who dress up in leotards and call themselves the New Delhi Power Rangers. They strike up a friendly conversation, which worries Leonard a little.Sheldon is on his way back from the toilet when he sees a coughing man being wheeled through the hallway. In order to escape the coughing, Sheldon ducks into a room (bearing a biohazard warning sign), before turning and seeing an astonished medical staff who declare he cannot leave as he has been exposed. Sheldon covers his face with his shirt and insists he is fine. Meanwhile, Priya and Penny walk past the biohazard room, chatting about Leonard's odd habits as a lover. Oblivious to Sheldon's cries for help as he is restrained by the medical team.A doctor comes in and announces it wasn't a heart attack, and says that Mrs. Wolowitz would like to see \"the little Catholic girl\" first. Bernadette returns to the waiting room and the first thing she does is scold Howard. She explains that his mother got food poisoning from the restaurant where they had lunch, and the reason she wanted to see Bernadette first was because she was worried she might have got it too. As for the engagement reaction, Mrs. Wolowitz thinks Bernadette is a wonderful girl and Howard is lucky to have her. This revelation comes as a shock and undermines everything Howard believes about his mother (whom he's always seen as an angry, unpleasant crone). Bernadette screams at him with a voice similar to his mother calling him a \"putz\" and storms off. Howard thinks her new voice is sexy.In the final scene, Leonard, Howard, and Raj are wearing hazmat and are playing Mystic Warlords of Ka'a with Sheldon, who is under quarantine because he was exposed to a deadly virus, and Raj is still giving annoying comments about every card.Title reference: Mrs. Wolowitz's reaction to the news of Howard and Bernadette's engagement.", "episode_13": "Leonard, Sheldon, Howard, Raj, Amy and Bernadette are invited to participate on a science panel at the Institute of Interdisciplinary Studies symposium on \"The Impact of Current Scientific Research on Societal Interactions\" in San Francisco. Amy reveals that Penny is her best friend and invites her to come along as Amy's plus one. Although Penny initially declines the offer with the excuse of her being \"very busy\" that particular date, her weekend quickly opens up when she hears they were going to an all-expense paid spa at Big Sur, California. When they get back to the apartment, Sheldon carries out an orientation for their trip. The orientation covers Q&A (Questions and Answers), Quiz, Safety Drills and a pose for a commemorative Group photo.The gang, consisting of seven people, is divided into two cars, the lead car, driven by Leonard, will be Leonard, Sheldon, Amy and Penny, and the second car, driven by Bernadette, will be Bernadette, Howard and Raj. Amy is excited that she was able to \"upgrade\" her \"best friend\" Penny from the second car to the lead car, by making the argument that if it broke down Penny's \"Nebraskan back-wood skills and brawny hands will give [the lead car members] the best chance to survive\". Amy and Sheldon will not be sharing a room as they believe knowing each other's \"toilet routine\" may jeopardize their relationship. Amy reveals she will be sharing a room with Penny, and adds she is the ideal roommate as travel makes her constipated.In the lead car, they are playing a guessing game about what element Sheldon is; Penny seems lost in the more intellectual crowd. This game annoys Penny and she questions the decision of giving Sheldon the post as \"Road Trip God\" (Travel Supervisor). Penny urges the rest of them to stand up against him, which results in her being demoted to the second car. Bernadette tells Penny to not worry, as she is in the better car. Howard adds that this car is the \"Love Car\". Bernadette and Howard begin to sing \"I Got You Babe\" as a duet; Penny swiftly apologizes to Sheldon.As they enter the hotel Bernadette reunites with Glenn (Rick Fox), her professor in college whom she dated for a year. He addresses her as Bernie. Howard is a little troubled by his height (6 foot 7 inches) and wonders about the size of his penis. Howard, still a little troubled, subtly tells Bernadette that his penis could not provide as much pleasure as Glenn's. He also accidentally implies that Bernadette isn't hot enough to date Glenn, but in a desperate attempt to mend the situation, he corrects himself by saying that Bernadette is too hot to date Glenn.Bernadette asks Amy and Penny if she can stay in their room, as \"Howard is a complete and total ass\". This results in Penny and Amy sharing a double bed. Amy warns Penny that she is prone to night terrors, and if she is suffering from one she asks Penny to pin her down and stroke her hair. Later, Penny comes to Leonard's room seeking to crash with them because \"Howard is a complete and total ass, Bernadette is in my bed and no matter how much you stroke Amy's hair, she bites.\" As Penny refuses to sleep in Sheldon's bed, she sleeps in Leonard's. After she makes a Star Trek reference (\"From the waist down, my shields are up\"), Leonard tries to engage in sexual activities with Penny. This noise wakes Sheldon up; as Leonard cannot guarantee they won't have coitus in the middle of the night Sheldon leaves the room.Raj enjoying his room alone takes some tissue and turns on the television implying he is about to masturbate, but the actually he is watching Bridget Jones's Diary and the tissues are to wipe his tears. Sheldon quickly interrupts him and requests to sleep in Raj's room because \"Howard is a complete and total ass, Bernadette is in Penny's bed, Amy bites and Penny may or may not have coitus with Leonard\". Raj allows it. Leonard and Penny have an awkward talk about their former romantic relationship, resulting in agreeing to have sex. But before anything happens they are interrupted by Raj, who received the room key from Sheldon after being kicked out of his own room. Leonard is infuriated by Raj's interruption.The following morning, Sheldon opens the Science & Society panel with a poorly-received joke. Bernadette is asked to speak next; on mike she says \"It's not just giant nuclear weapon can destroy the world, as a microbiologist I can tell you that even the tiniest micro-organism can tear you a new one.\" Howard then replies, \"Though she claims her field of interest is micro-organism, she has spent her fair share of time around what we can assume is pretty massive weaponry.\" Bernadette then says she can get all the giant missiles she wants.\nAmy then asks whether they are talking about woman wanting penises. Raj clearly intoxicated then adds that he thinks they are talking about penises and that the mimosas are kicking his \"little brown ass\". Leonard says he would like to kick Raj's \"little brown ass\" and explains he is still upset about Raj interrupting his chance to get back with Penny. Penny quickly clarifies that it was just a hook-up, and they weren't getting back together.\nDespite the hysteria, Sheldon tries to bring the topic back to center, but fails. As Howard and Bernadette continue their petty feud, Sheldon opens the audience to Q&A. Penny publicly asks if anybody can drive her back to Los Angeles. Glenn agrees to drive her; as Leonard sees Glenn's height he is quickly threatened and yells out \"Noooo\".Later, in the second car they have an awkward drive, with a hung over Raj and a bickering couple, as Sheldon proposes a game of spotting what he sees. Annoyed; Howard throws out the Walkie-Talkie. Meanwhile, Leonard is still very upset, evident as he is driving at 120 miles per hour (about 180 kilometer per hour). Sheldon reveals that he spotted an aluminum tire rim on a police car. The police siren is sounded, implying Leonard is being pulled over for speeding.Title reference: The car in which Howard, Bernadette and Raj were riding and is reminiscent of The Love Boat with their bed swapping plot.", "episode_17": "Leonard is going over to Raj's apartment for dinner with the gang; however, Sheldon insists he stays because of their Thursday tradition of eating pizza at their apartment. Leonard is still going so Sheldon tags along. After a brief unsatisfactory experience at Raj's, Sheldon heads to The Cheesecake Factory's bar alone and tries to get Penny to empathize with him. Amy video calls him and points out that Leonard is the \"nucleus\" of their social group.Later, back at apartment 4A, Sheldon prepares some snacks for his forthcoming guests Stuart (Kevin Sussman) (who came to take a hot shower because he's living in his comic book store), Kripke (John Ross Bowie) (who came for a raffle or waffle), Zack (who isn't sure what he is or why he's there), and LeVar Burton (whom he invited via Twitter); he invites everyone to form a new social group where he is the \"nucleus\". At Sheldon's event, he announces that it seems LeVar Burton will not be attending, and kicks off the gathering with some introductory activities, in which all of the guests receive a goody bag containing a free copy of the fictitious The New England Journal of High Energy Physics.Amy and Bernadette come over to Penny's to \"kidnap\" her for a night out dancing to get over Leonard. She agrees, if the two agree not to pester her about Leonard any further. They try to get Penny to go to a place where she can get a young guy to have sex with. She refuses, but then Amy and Bernadette discover the preserved snowflake from the North Pole which Leonard gave her (in \"The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation\") on her bedside table. She holds it in her hands and stares at it pensively for a moment before changing her mind.Back at Sheldon's event, Zack impresses the gang (except Sheldon) with his racy story (he was in a hot tub, and a girl came over, got naked, and got in with him. They ended up having sex). Next, Sheldon asks the gang to choose between an array of vintage video games (Smurf: Rescue in Gargamel's Castle, Cookie Monster Munch and Zork, which Sheldon emphasizes over the others by exclaiming, \"Pick me! Pick me!\") which the others find boring so Kripke decides to bring up his karaoke machine instead. Zack leaves to get some beer.Back at Raj's, the gang is reminiscing about their experiences with Sheldon. Sheldon is suddenly at the door and he is greeted with a warm welcome. Sheldon asks if anyone knows why a salute is called a toast and Priya knows the answer. He thinks she is something of a know-it-all.In the final scene, in the apartment building outside apartment 4A, LeVar Burton ends up making an appearance to join them, but swiftly changes his mind after seeing Stuart, Kripke, and Zack singing \"Walking On Sunshine\", with Stuart in a towel. And says that he is so through with Twitter (with which Sheldon had invited him to the party).Title reference: The group reminiscing about Sheldon explaining the origin of making a toast to them.", "episode_21": "Sheldon barges into the bathroom while Leonard is showering, stating that he drank a 32-ounce smoothie and needs to urinate immediately. Leonard discourages it and points out Priya is in the shower with him. Sheldon is angered by her presence, claiming it is a violation of the Roommate Agreement, but he has no time to waste so he rushes over to Penny's place to urinate there. The following morning, Sheldon charges Leonard with two violations of the Roommate Agreement, but Priya defends Leonard with her lawyer skills (emergency was not described properly), nullifying Sheldon's charges.That night, Leonard, Howard, Raj, and Priya are eating Greek food on Pizza Night. When Sheldon arrives home, he realizes everyone is not eating pizza on Pizza Night which is a violation of the Roommate Agreement, but, before he can do anything, Priya uses her lawyer skills to legalize the Greek food (The new pizza place was not appointed as per Sheldon's own protocol). Sheldon gives in and begins eating a lamb kebab which he claims \"tastes like sweat\". Soon, Sheldon can't take it anymore, so he goes over to Penny's and congratulates her on hosting Pizza Night at her apartment. Penny declines as she is going out with Amy and Bernadette. Penny invites Sheldon, who initially refuses, but agrees upon hearing that they probably will be \"trashing\" Priya.At a bar, Penny, Amy, and Bernadette are drinking alcoholic beverages while Sheldon is drinking milk. Amy warns Sheldon that they may go crazy and, soon enough, the girls are all drunk and in Amy's drunken state she asks Sheldon to kiss her and calls it a \"scientific experiment\". He declines and, instead, Amy kisses Penny. They both explode in giggles. Soon, this action brings up the dance topic and since Sheldon claims to be good at dancing styles such as the Rumba, Waltz, and Cha Cha, the girls force him to go dancing. Later, at a dance spot, Sheldon and Amy are dancing together when an old man approaches Penny and Bernadette and asks Bernadette to dance with him, but she excuses herself on account of being engaged to Howard. The old man then asks Penny, who accepts. He dances with her, but keeps moving his hands down to her rear.Sheldon follows Amy back to her apartment. Amy invites Sheldon in and offers him some Yoo-Hoo, which he accepts. When Sheldon is in the apartment he smells someone smoking and inquires about it, and Amy directs his attention to the smoking monkey who is a part of her department's nicotine addiction study. Since Amy is giving him cancer, she figures she should let him hang out and watch cable television. Next, Sheldon tells Amy about Priya nullifying his Roommate Agreement and the power that comes with it. Amy tells him to play dirty and then kisses him. Amy then tells Sheldon not to take her next action as a comment on the kiss; she dashes to the bathroom and vomits.The following morning, Sheldon has written a new and improved version of the Roommate Agreement and wants Leonard to sign it, but he refuses. Sheldon, foreseeing this comment, activates a self-destruct sequence on his laptop, akin to how Captain Kirk in the Star Trek episode \"Let That Be Your Last Battlefield\" activated the self-destruct sequence and threatened to blow up the Enterprise to kill both himself and an alien nemesis, unless he gave in to his demands. The self-destruct sequence will send an email to Mr. and Mrs. Koothrappali informing them about Priya's secret relationship with a white boy. Leonard signs the paper after Priya threatens to end their relationship if he doesn't. Sheldon exclaims to Priya that she may have gone to Cambridge, but he is an honorary graduate of fictional Starfleet Academy.In the final scene, Amy, very hungover, video chats with Sheldon and asks him what happened the previous night. Sheldon fills her in on the details including the kiss. They agree to restore their relationship to the point where both of them thought that it worked.Title reference: Priya using her skills as a lawyer to nullify Leonard and Sheldon's roommate agreement.", "episode_20": "At a book store Brian Greene is promoting his new physics book: The Hidden Reality, where he attempts to present complex physics issues in a manner understandable to non-scientists.

As they listen to his presentation, Amy tells Sheldon a piece of gossip she got from Penny: Bernadette is thinking of breaking up with Howard.The following day, Leonard and Sheldon are playing Wii Sports: Archery in their apartment. Sheldon brings up his discussion with Amy, passing on the piece of gossip to Leonard. He eventually tells Priya (while explaining how Sheldon requires people to stand away from the mirror when flossing) who mentions that Raj has a crush on Bernadette and Raj would be happy if Bernadette went ahead with the break up with HowardLeonard runs into Penny in the apartment building lobby and tries to pass on the gossip only to find out that she was the root source of the gossip (though she obliviously blames Amy for being the root source of the gossip and complaining about Amy's inability to keep a secret). Leonard follows it up with informing Penny about Raj's crush on Bernadette and noting how it could lead to the end of Howard and Raj's friendship. Penny promises to keep this news secret. Meanwhile, Priya implicitly tells Raj about Bernadette while they're on a video conference with their parents (VM Koothrappali (Brian George) & mother (Alice Amter)) while Priya continuously tries to prevent Raj from telling them about her relationship with Leonard.At lunch in the university cafeteria, Howard tells the gang that he's planning to ask Bernadette to marry him. As he disappears to discuss the wedding ring with his cousin, the rest of the gang express their concern, or in Raj's case, excitement, about the heartbreak he'd get if he tried to ask Bernadette to marry him, only to have her break up with him.Sheldon and Amy are having drinks in Sheldon's apartment discussing the news that Howard is going to propose to Bernadette. The general interest that the topic had created among their social circle intrigues the pair and prompts them to begin experiments to study meme theory and the spread of gossip. To begin their experiment, Amy tells Penny that she and Sheldon had sex and that she was thinking of starting an herb garden. Penny tells Raj about Amy and Sheldon after she catches him at the The Cheesecake Factory hitting on Bernadette.Later, Leonard brings home dinner and starts trying to mine Sheldon for information about his relationship with Amy, mentioning off hand that he'd just spoken to Raj. Sheldon deflects the questioning, though he provides a few inquiries to ensure that Leonard was discussing the rumors about sex and not the herb garden. After Leonard heads to his room, it's revealed that, during that time, Amy was listening to the conversation via Sheldon's computer. They express surprise at how quickly the information was propagating through the group. By the time dinner happens, Amy has determined that the piece of gossip is known by everyone in their social group, taking less than 24 hours to reach everyone. At dinner, Howard decides to propose there and, to everyone's surprise, Bernadette accepts. Everyone is happy for them except Raj who is crying and disappointed.In a follow-up experiment, Amy tells Penny she's pregnant with Sheldon's child and she is getting Orthotics. As she walks down the stairs, she runs into Leonard who had just received a text from Penny passing on the news, to his astonishment.Title reference: The mundane false rumor that is part of Amy and Sheldon's experiment.", "episode_18": "Leonard and Priya are in bed together at Leonard's place. They discuss the racism implied in Leonard's attempt in trying out positions from the Kama Sutra and, shortly after, Priya urges him to get contact lenses as she claims he has beautiful eyes.Later, at the cafeteria, Howard offers to show Raj a magic trick, but Sheldon intervenes and tells him he shouldn't be wasting his time with such trivial matters. Howard performs the trick anyway and impresses both Raj and Sheldon. Although Sheldon mocks the trick, he is still keen to unravel it. Leonard comes in with his new contact lenses which are clearly incompatible with him, and he crashes into several people and furniture.Back at apartment 4A, Howard impresses Penny with his magic trick as Sheldon watches carefully, apparently still stumped by the card trick. Leonard comes back from shopping for \"more grown-up\" clothes with Priya and they head for his room. Priya voices her feelings about Leonard hanging out with Penny all the time and asks him to terminate their relationship, and he reluctantly agrees. Meanwhile, Howard continually impresses his friends with the magic trick, and Penny appears to have successfully figured out the magic trick, which further crushes Sheldon's ego.Leonard and Penny bump into each other in the laundry room, where Penny \"saves\" Leonard's new silk shirt that he was about to ruin by throwing it into the washing machine. She goes on to compliment Leonard's choice in Priya as a real winner.\nPenny gathers her laundry and looks at Leonard for a moment before saying goodbye, but Leonard stops her and nervously tries to hint that he would like to see her less without saying it directly. His obscure method of \"cutting their ties\" confuses Penny, and she leaves the room thinking no differently of their friendship. Later, when Priya questions him about whether or not he spoke to Penny about this issue yet, he hastily confirms that he has, hoping that the issue is now settled.Meanwhile, Sheldon has grown increasingly obsessive with understanding Howard's magic trick, and has even gone as far as hacking into the Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Cray supercomputer to analyze shuffling patterns and looks into procuring Uranium-235 off of Craigslist after wondering if Howard used a radioactive tracer.Later that evening, Priya and Leonard are having dinner at the Tandoori Palace and Priya reveals that her company has offered her a job in Los Angeles. Leonard is thrilled at this news, but as the couple hold hands they're interrupted by a tapping noise and look up to see Penny smiling and waving at them through the window. She then enters the restaurant and makes a scene, mocking Leonard's clothes and appearance before picking food off his plate and drinking out of his glass. These actions anger Priya, who deduces that Leonard never fulfilled his promise to cut his ties with Penny.At the cafeteria, Sheldon claims he has solved and improved Howard's magic trick. Howard and Raj are interested to see his version of the trick, but soon see that he has bar-coded all the cards and used a bar-code reader to identify it. Howard criticizes Sheldon's execution was pathetic, and Sheldon is once again annoyed, because he assumed they weren't smart enough to figure it out. Howard shows the trick again, but this time it is revealed to the audience that there is no trick, as Raj (and Penny) has been playing along with Howard's wild guesses as a mean joke on Sheldon, knowing that he would go nuts trying to figure it out.Later, Leonard finally musters up the courage to tell the truth to Penny, and it quickly dawns on her that there are complications in their friendship due to Leonard's current relationship with Priya, and she agrees to keep a distance. She kisses him and tells him goodbye. Leonard goes after her, but runs into the door frame because of his contact lenses.Sheldon is depressed that he is unable to solve the magic trick. The Department of Homeland Security busted him for hacking into the Cray supercomputer and trying to buy Uranium-235 over the internet. (Rather than arresting him, the DHS let his mother deal with him, which Sheldon claims is a far worse punishment.) Howard offers to show it again. However, this time Sheldon requests Howard try it on him, and Howard reluctantly agrees. Sheldon isn't \"gullible\" like Raj is, and with his finely-tuned senses, he will spot Howard's trick as soon as Howard screws up. With all of his focus on Howard, Sheldon doesn't notice Raj signaling to Howard that Sheldon's card is the two of hearts. Furiously, Sheldon storms out of the cafeteria as Raj and Howard dissolve into laughter.Title reference: Howard's faux prestidigitation magic card trick.", "episode_19": "Leonard returns home to find Sheldon hyperventilating in anxiety. A police officer is present, trying to calm Sheldon down, after having been sent when Sheldon called the Pasadena Police Department in a panic. Although Sheldon seems to be speaking of actual items, it becomes clear to Leonard that what had actually happened was that Sheldon's World of Warcraft account was hacked. Sheldon called the FBI (who, he says, had hung up on him) and then the local police. The officer leaves, derisively telling Sheldon that the police do not have jurisdiction in Pandora (Sheldon corrects him by stating the setting for World of Warcraft is, in fact, Azeroth). Rather than reporting the incident to the game's developer, Blizzard Entertainment Sheldon assembles the guys to track down the offending hacker.Later, Penny brings Sheldon a cheesecake, hoping to console him. Penny encounters Priya as she's departing Leonard and Sheldon's apartment. Penny nervously explains the situation to Priya-in part, ostensibly, to assuage the latter's earlier request that Penny dissociate herself with Leonard. This action confounds Priya-and she becomes even more irritated when Priya determines that Leonard is working with Howard and Raj in order to find the culpable hacker, rather than spending time with her. Eventually, Priya decides to leave, intoning a sarcastic comment that whizzes by Leonard and causes Sheldon to realize a very rare, unspoken Bazinga.Meanwhile, Penny is hosting Amy and Bernadette at her apartment. There, they discuss Priya. Penny is furious that Priya is benefiting from all of Penny's efforts to encourage Leonard to be more adventurous and willing to try various things. Her thanks, she says, is that she is now denied the right to talk with Leonard anymore. Bernadette suggests that they socially reject Priya. Amy responds that it is the natural response of members of a primate social group to want to throw their feces at individuals who disturb the social group. As they depart to go drinking, they encounter Priya as she is leaving Leonard and Sheldon's. Amy actively displays her hostility towards Priya, as the four women walk down to the lobby.The following day, Howard tells the group that he has determined the identity of the offending hacker and has determined the hacker resides within a short driving distance, Carlsbad just north of San Diego. Sheldon persuades the others that they should drive to the hacker-thief's house that evening and confront him as to the acts they believe him culpable of. Leonard interposes his reservations as to this course of action, as he doesn't feel it appropriate to stand Priya up for two straight nights.Prior to departing, it develops that Leonard had told Priya he had been working late to explain his absence and to \"cover\" his involvement in the group's activities. The news of Leonard's deception of Priya upsets her brother Raj who is incensed further when asked by Leonard to \"cover him\" when Priya asks Raj whether Leonard was telling the truth-although Raj acts in a brotherly way, in order to get the point across to Leonard.The gang then proceeds to the hacker's residence to confront Todd Zarnecki, only to discover that he is a taller, bigger teenage nerd. When Sheldon asks for his property to be returned to him, not only does the hacker refuse, but he also takes Sheldon's collectible Klingon Bat'Leth which Sheldon brought along as a form of intimidation and immediately shuts his door. Defeated, the gang proceeds to return home. On the way, Leonard's car breaks down.They call Penny to take them home in her car. Penny is surprised Leonard did not call Priya to explain his absence. Leonard indicates it was because he had told Priya he was working, and Penny notes that this time might mean that on that occasion, Leonard perhaps did not want to see Priya. Reacting Penny only says \"interesting\". Penny discovers the gang has failed in their quest. At becoming aware of this development, Penny immediately takes the gang back to the hacker-thief's house, vowing to show them how to solve a quest \"Nebraska-style\".\nWhen the hacker denies his actions to Penny, she responds by delivering a groin kick to the hacker and persuades him to return Sheldon's World of Warcraft objects and account settings to the way they were.The following day, Penny encounters Priya in the lobby, and the two walk up the stairs together in strained silence. After Priya enters Leonard's apartment, Penny, realizing to herself she has become \"territorial\" about the guys, comments to herself that Amy was correct, and says that \"I do want to throw poop at her\".Title reference: Todd Zarnecki's hacking of Sheldon's World of Warcraft account."}, "season_8": {"episode_6": "During takeout dinner in apartment 4A, Penny is wearing her new business suit while Howard comments how good she looks while going out on sales calls and flirting with doctors. Penny disagrees that she is flirting to make sales, though she does agree with Amy that it is good that she is showing her cleavage when she leans over.\nBernadette asks Sheldon how his work in dark matter is going and he remarks that it is the most exciting time to work in it since HE is now working in it. Raj mentions that the government is funding the dark matter field by sending teams down into a salt mine to conduct experiments. Raj suggests that he and Sheldon apply since they could be on the ground floor of something big. Penny tells Sheldon that he shouldn't go down into a mine since he had a panic attack while going through a car wash.At dinner, Leonard tries to tell Penny about a new version of an old video game he was playing; however, Penny is thinking about her new job as a sales rep for a pharmaceutical company. She says she has some good news and hands Leonard an envelope full of money. She tells him she was given a company car, so she sold the car Leonard gave her. He agrees that she didn't need two cars, but seems hurt that she sold the first one without telling him. They then spend a while passing the envelope of money back and forth, trying to get the other to accept it.Raj enters Sheldon's office and asks if he is busy. Sheldon's mind is always multitasking. He is working on a complex problem, composing his Nobel Prize acceptance speech for solving that problem and trying to figure out how mermaids have offspring. Raj says that they just lay eggs on rocks which means that Sheldon's mind can now work on another problem. Raj wonders if their friends were right that the conditions would be too harsh for the two of them down in the mine. It would be hot, humid, live explosions, since it is a working mine, twelve hour shifts underground and the toilet facilities would be a bucket. Sheldon was fine with everything except the last condition. Raj still wants to test themselves under simulated conditions to see if they can do it since it is such a great opportunity. Sheldon wants to try it and goes to his computer to check for hot, dark moist places and finding a bunch of sex video sites.Leonard comes into Penny's apartment with the money to work something out. Last night Penny felt that it was really weird for Leonard to leave a large envelope of money on her dresser after they had sex. Leonard wants them to put it in a joint savings account to use for their wedding expenses which Penny thinks is a great idea. Leonard realizes that Penny feels great about being financially independent and he is nothing but proud of her. Penny tells Leonard that her making money means that she is not as dependent on Leonard, while he thinks that she has a problem with her control issues. They finally agree not to fight and that the money belongs to both of them.Raj and Sheldon dressed in mining gear and carrying a bucket arrive with Amy at a basement access door to the university steam pipe tunnels. Amy had stayed in one for three days to pledge a sorority, but they forgot she was down there. The conditions there are more consistent than in the steam bath. In case of an emergency, Amy has to rescue him first and then come back for Raj. Down in the tunnel, Sheldon starts his mine simulation log and quickly finds Raj's stating of the obvious very tedious.Penny and Leonard are visiting Howard and Bernadette to discuss how they handle finances in their marriage. Howard and Bernadette sometimes fight about money. She makes a lot more than him, though Howard claims to have brought assets into the marriage. Like his incomplete set of Star Trek collectible plates? Howard replies that he just got the last one on eBay without telling Bernadette. Then Howard brings up all the late fees from not paying the credit card bills on time. Bernadette retorts that she would if she wasn't spending all her time cleaning the apartment. Howard grabs his chore chart and shows her all the stars he has though Bernadette berates the quality of his work. Howard runs into the bedroom after she mentions his personal allowance. Penny worries about her and Leonard; however, Leonard grew up in a home where his mother earned more and also emasculated his father in every way. Penny and Leonard decide to work things out before they are married and to use the Wolowitzes as an example of what not to do.Back in the tunnel, Sheldon is feeling a bit claustrophobic and starts singing a miners song which describes all the bad conditions. Raj switches over to Miley Cyrus, though Sheldon doesn't know who he is. Raj starts to describe her \"Hannah Montana\" TV show? Amy asks if they need anything since she's going to the vending machine. Sheldon gives her a long list. Sheldon's claustrophobia gets worse as does his need to use the bucket which he refuses to do. He is now in his thirties and starting over with studying dark matter where he used to be at the top of his field. This scares him. When Raj is scared he thinks of Voyager. The space probe mission was already over after he was born, but the probe just keeps going, still sending back data from outside our solar solar system. Sheldon then sees some rats behind Raj and heads up the ladder. Amy is returning as Sheldon yells that everything is falling apart and it's too late for Raj. He lasted 11 minutes. Raj is shouting from inside the tunnel as the rats crawl into his shirt.Leonard and Penny decide to spread the money all over the bed and make love on it. Penny thinks that that is the most fun someone can have with money, but won't say if it's only the first time she's done it. Bernadette apologizes to Howard after sex and tells him that she wants them to handle their money as equal adult partners. Amy is busy transcribing Sheldon's mine simulation log for future generations who obviously want to hear about his melted Kit Kat bar. Raj comes charging into the apartment to yell at him that Sheldon left him there to fend off a family of rats and calls him a coward for abandoning him in the tunnel.Title reference: Sheldon and Raj simulating working in a salt mine by crawling into the steam pipe tunnel.", "episode_17": "As Penny and Leonard climb the stairs Leonard is very excited saying that he was totally unstoppable and in the zone. Penny brings him down because it was only miniature golf and she beat him. As they enter apartment 4A, Sheldon is glad they have returned because he and Amy have some exciting news. Amy and Sheldon announce that they are taking their relationship to the next level which really confuses Leonard and Penny. They are getting a pet together, a turtle. While Penny jokingly says that she keeps saying they should stock champagne on ice for occasions like this, Leonard congratulates them. He wonders out loud that who would have thought that Amy and Sheldon would be the first couple in their group to start a family!In Emily's apartment, Raj and Emily have gotten together for movie night. Raj can spend the night because her roommate won't be back since Emily murdered her (or not). Raj reminds her that their agreement was for her to say \"just kidding\" when she was kidding about having killed someone. She also tells him that she would never hurt him making Raj a little uncomfortable. Emily gets a call from the hospital to check up on a patient. Raj is staying in the apartment until Emily gets back. And her roommate is in another city, or at least her torso is. She adds that she was just kidding since she used the wood chipper.At the pet store, Sheldon can't stand walking by all the puppies. Then they try and pick out a turtle. The first one Amy suggests looks like a jerk to Sheldon. Sheldon likes one that is barely moving. Sheldon asks the turtle if he wants to come live with him even though they don't live in the same house. Amy reassures it that that is not the turtle's fault as if it was a child of divorce. The turtle will stay at Amy's if Sheldon is away, at Comic-Con or on Mars. Mars? Sheldon announces that he is putting in an application to be one of the first colonists on Mars. Amy is shocked, especially since he didn't consult her. She would not have approved of it.While making out on the couch, Leonard admits to Penny that he had gotten her a Valentine's Day gift, but was too embarrassed to actually give it to her since he bought it at the dirty book store. He got an artistic present which Penny thinks he got at Michael's. It's a canvas and body paint to use while having sex. Penny loves it.Howard is playing a video game while Bernadette is doing their taxes. She has a lot of receipts from the Lego Store that Howard says are business expenses. Raj calls Howard while he is Emily's bedroom since he is alone. Raj opens the drawer of her bed bureau and can't get it closed. Raj doesn't want her to know he has been snooping. The he breaks the drawer trying to fix it. Bernadette hears what is going on and tells Howard that she is going to miss her.Leonard and Penny inspect their canvas and are not happy with it. They didn't move around enough and vow that they can do better because they are not old and boring. Leonard is fine with trying again in thirty minutes after he recovers.Sheldon and Amy are returning from the pet store without a turtle because the turtle bit him. Sheldon was trying to get the turtle to like him. Amy wonders why he even bothers since he is planning to leave Earth the first chance he gets. Even though the chances of him being picked is small, it still hurts her that he didn't ask her before filling out the application. How he can survive another planet when he barely survived his turtle bite? Sheldon tries to cheer her up by playing the Star Trek theme on his nose. She is still mad.In Leonard and Sheldon's apartment, Amy is still fuming and wonders why he even wants to go to Mars. He shows her his application video which answers that question. On the video Sheldon says how intelligently and hygienically clean he is, and how much fun he would be. He demonstrates his wacky sense of humor on a long voyage by smashing a pie in Leonard's face.After their second canvas, Penny is getting paint out of Leonard's eye because she wouldn't let him wear safety goggles.\nHoward has Raj nailed the front back on the drawer. As Emily returns they get into a fight over his snooping. Bernadette mentions that if they break up, it will be too bad because she likes her.In Penny's bedroom the new canvas is much more colorful and they are happy with the results. Penny refuses to hang a picture made by their butts in her apartment. To make sure it doesn't go to waste, they plan to give it to Sheldon and tell him that it was painted by William Shatner.Amy decides to leave. Even though she thinks it sounds silly, she thought that getting a turtle together meant something to him. Sheldon chases after Amy who is mad since they were supposed to make plans for a future that's not on different planets. Sheldon asks Amy if they have to be on Earth? Are you suggesting we could go together? Sheldon wants her to go. Amy hugs him tightly as they go to file an application video together. Amy says that they could be the first to procreate on Mars. Sheldon tells her that she just can't keep it in her space pants. She also mentions that their kids would be Martians. Sheldon likes that idea.Raj and Emily are together in bed after she forgave him. Then she asks if he looked in her closet and Raj says no. \"Good,\" she replies smiling and then she goes to sleep. Raj looks worried as he eyes the closet, and then her.Title reference: Sheldon applying to the Mars One program.\nNote: The vanity card at the end of the episode paid tribute to the late Leonard Nimoy who passed away on February 27th.", "episode_1": "Sheldon (Jim Parsons) is at a train station wearing no pants, no shoes and one sock looking quite disheveled after being robbed. He tries to tell random people that he is a physicist and that he is not crazy though everybody he meets acts like he is.Penny (Kaley Cuoco), with her new short haircut is doing yoga in apartment. Leonard (Johnny Galecki) gets a call from Sheldon who is at the Kingman, Arizona police station and asks Leonard to come and get him. Penny can't come with him because she has a job interview and doesn't want to hear Sheldon complaining about her short hair for six hours.Howard (Simon Helberg) is taking Raj (Kunal Nayyar) to work since his car is being worked on. He is having his windows cleared of tint so the world can see his hot girlfriend. Howard is explaining that Stuart (Kevin Sussman) is supposed to be moving out of his mother's house since she's fully healed. Its creepy, more like Raj and his dog. They call each other \"Debbie\" and \"Stewie\". Raj wonders if Howard is worried that he is being replaced as her son or that she may becoming her lover, which really bothers Howard.At the police station, Sheldon inquires about his stolen possessions and lectures Officer Hernandez on Sherlock Holmes and his investigation techniques. Sheldon reminds him that there are lots of Sherlock Holmes books and no Officer Hernandez books.\nAmy (Mayim Bialik) and Leonard are en route to get Sheldon. She is glad to have come, but is peeved that Leonard was called instead of her.Penny is with Bernadette (Melissa Rauch) just prior to her interview and is nervous since she hasn't had a job interview in years. Bernie describes Penny's good points and can only come up that she is cute and funny. It seems that selling pharmaceuticals is like being a waitress pushing the bad stuff onto the customers. Bernadette talked her up to Dan (Stephen Root) and wouldn't have done it if she didn't think she could do the job. Penny wants to cancel. Bernadette realizes that she wants to do something she's good at, and angrily suggests getting her a job at the \"sitting-around-in-your-yoga-pants-doing-nothing-factory\".Howard and Raj enter his mother's house. Stuart comes in confusing Howard since he thought Stuart had moved out. Stuart was going to, but since he still has no place to go, he and Debbie decided that he should stay especially since they get along so well. Howard wonders why his mother hadn't spoken to him about this arrangement. As Stuart is leaving he tells Howard that maybe he should call home more often. Note that Raj is obviously still seeing Emily (Laura Spencer).Sheldon is staring at Officer Hernandez who claims that they are doing everything they can while he is munching on Doritos. Amy and Leonard show up. Sheldon excitedly hugs Leonard and wants to know why Amy came. Amy reacts that he is her boyfriend and that she just drove six hours to help him out. Sheldon calls \"Shotgun\" and runs towards the car.On their way back, Leonard asks Sheldon to tell them about his trip. He went to New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Denver, Seattle etc. When asked how he liked those cities, he explains that he never left any of the train stations. He never left the stations or had a single piece of fruit.Penny is at her interview with Dan as a pharmaceutical sales representative and keeps explaining that she likes people over and over. When asked how her previous job experience prepared her for sales, she tells the interviewer that she convinced many large customers to order extra cheesecake; one person that even had an insulin pump. The interviewer uses an insulin pump.Howard says he's unhappy about a man in his thirties, though Raj thought he was 45 (he's actually 39), living with his mother. Raj says that since she is lonely and he needs a place to stay what is wrong with that, besides who cares. Howard decides to call her to raise his objections. He doesn't get her; however, the answering machine has a message from both his mother and Stuart on it.During the interview, Penny is asked how she would suggest to someone to switch from a competitor's product to their company's drug. She stares for a moment and then tells him that she could offer the client a bikini car wash. Penny doesn't want Bernadette to know how badly she failed at the interview because she's scared of her. The interviewer thought he was the only one scared of her. He didn't want to meet with Penny, but was afraid to say no to her. Penny also couldn't say no to Bernadette when she got her the interview and feels that she is something of a bully. When the interviewer had to tell Bernadette that her project was being cut, he couldn't do it to her. Penny got the job.Amy is upset on the drive back. How could he have left her without even saying Parting goodbye and then call Leonard instead of her. Sheldon wants to have a private moment with Leonard and asks Amy to cover her ears. He then claims to want to have coitus with her just to see if she can hear him. Sheldon didn't want to call Amy because he didn't want her to know that he couldn't make it on his own. Sheldon says that he feels that way since Leonard supposedly idolizes Sheldon and nothing could knock him of the pedestal Leonard has put him on.\nLeonard just tells Sheldon that he should tell Amy. He does and Amy replies that she knows he is not perfect and that she is fine with that. He asks for another private moment as Amy covers her ears smiling. Sheldon then tells Leonard that he wants to breakup with her.At Howard and Bernadette's, Howard says that he never thought he would say this, but he is missing Sheldon. Bernadette also says that she never thought she would say this, but Penny got the job. Stuart shows up, saying he felt that Howard wasn't all right with him staying at Howard's mother's house. Howard agrees, and tells him that he is living there rent-free and that he has no motivation to go out and get a job. Stuart notes that Howard is not his father. He then mentions \"your mother and I\" and Howard accuses him of being his father. Bernadette calms the waters and reminds both of them that \"nobody is anybody's father\". Howard accidentally calls Bernadette his mother before correcting himself.Walking up the stairs, Sheldon says that he wishes he never went on the trip. Amy tells him to consider it as an adventure which appeases Sheldon. He feels he was a caterpillar that has emerged as the world's smartest butterfly. Penny greets Sheldon and he sees that she cut her hair, causing him to leave again, being unable to deal with the change.Finally, Sheldon is showing Leonard and Penny the pictures he had taken on his trip, including those of a train bathroom he had visited and the Imodium he took so he wouldn't have to use the toilet. Then he talks about how he almost died in a fire in Des Moines, but he stayed put, and that's when the Imodium gave out.Title reference: Sheldon's train adventure is interrupted when his belongings are stolen.", "episode_11": "At dinner in Apartment 4A, Raj tells everyone that his parents are divorcing and getting themselves lawyers. Raj's father is visiting, so he can't host Christmas Eve dinner so Amy volunteers since she always wanted to host a traditional English Victorian Christmas for gang including parlor games, goose and Figgy pudding. Sheldon doesn't like Figgy pudding because of all of the raisins and won't come. Raj is a little miffed about themed-holidays since they didn't like his \"Tom Hanks\"-giving, and is angry when everyone takes an interest in Amy's Victorian theme.On Christmas Eve, Leonard and Howard are in contamination garments in the university clean-room constructing an experiment to detect Cosmic ray. Leonard likes the fact that he has no allergy problems due to the sterile room. A pigeon flies in the room because Howard left the loading dock door open. Now they have to get rid of it before the bird soils the dust-free room. Howard doesn't want to call facilities and get blamed. First he suggests they turn off all the Electric lights except for one, but that is to attract moths. At Amy's apartment, Amy and Penny are visiting with Raj and his father Dr. V.M. Koothrappali (Brian George) who has nothing good to say about his wife. On his twenty-hour airplane flight without his wife, he didn't pray for the plane to crash. The guys call Raj to help them deal with the pigeon. Dr. Koothrappali stays with the girls.Bernadette has picked up Sheldon and is singing Christmas carols about Santa Claus in her car with too much Christmas joy until Sheldon turns off the music. He and Amy decided not to get each other something for Christmas since Sheldon doesn't enjoy it. While they were Christmas tree shopping, Amy kissed him under the mistletoe in public making Sheldon very unhappy. Sheldon has decided to punish her to make her feel as miserable as he does so he is going to buy her a Christmas present. Since she has not gotten him one, that would ruin her Christmas and make her guilty and sad according to Sheldon's logic.Howard is trying to catch the pigeon in a garbage bag with a Slim Jim which, Leonard thinks is stupid. Howard doesn't want to get the blame even though he always tries to hide his culpability. Raj arrives and wants to know the situation. Leonard explains that Howard wants to catch the bird in a garbage bag with a Slim Jim, which he holds up and the pigeon snatches and flies off.Back at Amy's place, Dr. Koothrappali thinks that it is too soon to think about dating again. Amy brings out her first parlor game that involves blowing a ball of wool across a table. Penny also tells Raj's father that Amy is also taken.While trying to catch the pigeon, Howard tells Leonard that he is jealous because they used to be best friends till Raj came along. Leonard thinks that happened because Howard can push Raj around. Howard decides to make Raj get the bird out, but Raj is sure that it was Howard who let the pigeon in, scoffing at the idea that Leonard would do something like that.Bernadette and Sheldon are shopping for the perfect gift to ruin Amy's Christmas. Amy likes Chaucer, medieval literature and old French movies which make her eyes light up according to Sheldon. He also likes the way her fingers dance around on invisible harp strings whenever she hears harp music. He does admit that he really loves Amy, but he wants to find a gift to make her feel small and worthless.Amy and Dr. Koothrappali are now blowing the ball of wool back and forth across the table with increasing boredom, as Penny watches. Dr. Koothrappali wins though Penny quips that it probably doesn't feel that way. Penny brings up Raj's girlfriend Emily, who also works a lot. She thinks that that is funny, but Dr. Koothrappali is not amused.Sheldon is now sitting on Santa's lap telling him that he wants their photograph together to punish his girlfriend for making him celebrate Christmas. Santa thinks that dating Sheldon is punishment enough.Back in the clean room, they are trying to catch the bird with a blanket and a fire extinguisher to get him out the door. Leonard has the fire extinguisher, Raj is standing by the door to open it, and Howard has the blanket. They trade tools and Howard attacks the pigeon with the fire extinguisher which causes the bird to fall dead onto the floor. The bird is not breathing so Howard gives it CPR thus reviving the bird. As they carry the bird toward the door to let him out, a crow flies into the room because no one has yet closed the door. As the crow looks down at the guys, they debate calling building services on Christmas Eve. Penny calls Leonard and just tells them to leave as it's Christmas Eve and nobody would know they were in there to begin with. Even though they signed into the clean room, she tells them to erase their names off the list and get out of there. The next scene implies that they did just that, as it shows them in the car singing \"Jingle Bells\" heading toward the party.After finishing the Figgy pudding, Sheldon first complains about the raisins, but Amy tells him that they were figs, so Sheldon is fine with that. Dr. Koothrappali offers to help; however, since he Heimlich a ball of wool out of her, he didn't have to. Sheldon gives Amy his gift of his picture with Santa in a Picture frame that plays a personal Christmas greeting to her from him and she loves it. Sheldon tells her that she got him nothing, expecting her to be sad. He is happy because they will never do it again, but despite their agreement, she made Sheldon a gift, his favorite cookies from his Meemaw's recipe. Amy talked to her to get the recipe. Sheldon tries one and says they're perfect. Amy wishes Sheldon Merry Christmas. Everyone is happy and Sheldon wonders if giving is what Christmas is all about in a softer, gentler tone.Finally, with the party still occurring, Amy wants them all to sit down and play \"Hot Boiled Beans.\" Amy explains that one person leaves the room while the rest hide a small item in the room. The first person is invited back in by saying, \"Hot boiled beans and bacon for supper, hurry up before it gets cold!\" Raj shakes his head and claims they are all crazy.Title reference: Two birds invade the sterile clean room that Howard and Leonard are using for an experiment.", "episode_16": "At dinner, Amy mentions that she read a magazine article about how intimacy can be created between two people in an accelerated time frame. Sheldon considers dragging random people off the street to try it, but the others suggest he try the experiment on himself. Penny doesn't believe that Sheldon would answer intimate questions about himself and begs to be involved, assuring him that she won't fall in love with him.Heading into Penny's apartment, Sheldon tells Penny that if they fall in love she must drive him to GaryCon (Dungeons and Dragons). Penny agrees and tells him she'll even throw in \"all the dragon tee-shirts you want\".Raj thinks that Amy and Leonard are being calm about Penny and Sheldon possibly falling in love. He does not like to tempt fate. The other halves are not worried and decide to perform the experiment themselves. Question 1: \"Given the choice of anyone in the world, who would you like to have dinner with?\" Leonard says Penny. Amy replies that she'd pick the janitor because she's about to throw up. They quit. Howard and Bernadette are still traveling back from his mother's funeral in Florida.Switch to the airport arrivals area and Howard is screaming at the clerk behind the desk who claims that the airline has lost the suitcase that contains his mother's ashes (urn) and he demands them back.Starting the experiment, Penny asks Sheldon if he doesn't want wine. Sheldon doesn't want to drink when operating heavy machinery meaning his brain. The dinner guest question is first. Sheldon first mentions Euclid, the geometry founder, though he wears sandals and Sheldon can't eat dinner while looking at somebody's toes. Then he chooses himself, his own hero. Penny chooses Robert Downey Jr. a.k.a Iron Man. Sheldon then says he would like to join them for dessert.Raj picks up Emily. Amy tells them to choose the evening's activity since she and Leonard are tagging along. Emily suggests the group visit an escape room where you have to solve puzzles to get out of a room which includes being locked in with a zombie.Sheldon poses the next question to Penny which is to describe her perfect day. Penny replies that it would be sleep-in, yoga, beach, massage, Alcoholic drinks and dancing. Sheldon notes that she didn't mention Leonard and that he wouldn't enjoy any of that. Sheldon's perfect day would start with French toast and then he would travel to the future through a wormhole where his towering intellect is used to save the last remnants of humankind from a predatory alien race. Penny points out that he also didn't mention Amy. Sheldon says she made the French toast.The guys are escorted into a room which contains remnants of the laboratory of the late Dr. David Saltzburg who experimented on slowing the aging process. He died in a laboratory accident... Inside is a huge lab and the door is locked. As they start to look for clues, out bursts a chained-up zombie which scares them.The airline employee tells Howard that his bag did arrive at the airport. Unfortunately, maybe someone could have accidentally picked it up. The worst news is that this person could have gotten on an international flight. Howard again yells at her that her job is to find lost luggage and she has narrowed it down to the planet earth.Next question: If you could wake up with any one quality or ability, what would it be? Penny mocks that she would like to turn water into wine, to which Sheldon complains that she is not taking the experiment seriously. So then she replies that she wishes she could be as smart as everyone else in their social group. Sheldon would like to be able to read minds because he misinterprets how people are feeling. Are people joking with him or making fun of him? Are they mad at him or just in a bad mood. Penny then has a wave of affection for him that passes after Sheldon asks if it's just too much Bible juice.While the zombie cries out that he wants some brains, they solve the cipher code. Amy and Leonard use it to find a city on a globe to get the combination to the safe. The zombie wants them to slow down and not figure it out so fast.At the airport, Howard is bothered that he didn't drive his mother to the airport on her way to Florida since that would have been the last time he would have ever seen her.In the safe, they find a copy of Charles Darwin's \"Origin of the Species\" and in the book containing a black light. A riddle is hidden on the wall which Amy solves and Emily finds the key to open the door behind a picture. Emily had hoped the puzzles would have been harder, but the geniuses figured them out quickly and they spent $200 for six minutes of fun.Back at Penny's apartment and while they are having dinner, Penny asks if Sheldon were to die today and couldn't communicate with anyone, what would he most regret not having told someone? Sheldon says that there is something satisfying dying on one's birthday. Today was Sheldon's birthday? Sheldon despises gift giving and dreads surprise parties. Sheldon told Penny because the point of the experiment was to be completely honest with somebody which really touches Penny. Penny promises not to tell anyone, though she wouldn't have thought he was a Pisces. Sheldon quips that she is making it hard for him to love her.Finally, the airport finds Howard's bag. Howard apologizes to his mother that he didn't take her to the airport and that she'll remain close to him the rest of his life.For the final part of the experiment, Penny and Sheldon then stare into each other's eyes without talking. They are supposed to keep eye contact for a full four minutes and both struggle with this. Both find the experience creepy though they both admit that they are comfortable around each other and that they look on each other like a brother and sister. Penny can't believe it's been eight years. Sheldon can't believe she is still eating their food and he can tell her how much she owes them. The alarm goes off. Sheldon says it is safe to say that they are not in love with each other, but they do feel closer to each other. Given their new intimacy, they have some tough choices to make. How are they going to get to Garycon? And who gets to be Gary?Penny walks Sheldon home or across the hall to his place. Sheldon thanks her for a very interesting evening. Inside, the guys jump out at him shouting \"Surprise!\" with a makeshift birthday party, causing Sheldon to scream.Title reference: The emotional intimacy test taken by Sheldon and Penny.", "episode_10": "Sheldon is taping the final episode of \"Sheldon Cooper presents Fun with Flags.\" Amy sets off a party popper that scares Sheldon. After only 232 episodes, the Internet series is over. Actually 233 if Amy hadn't failed to hit the record button on a Fourth of July episode.Leonard, Howard and Raj are cleaning out Professor Roger Abbott's office, throwing out a life's work. Howard mused that someday someone else will throw out their work. Leonard really wonders if there are any important discoveries among the files. Raj finds a pen which when tilted; a girl's bathing suit falls off. Leonard finds a 50 year old bottle of champagne with a note from Professor Abbot's mother. The bottle is to be opened after he makes his first great discovery.Penny meets her boss Dan (Stephen Root) at a company banquet and he greets her as his newest star employee who is the third best sales rep. Dan calls Bernie \"dear, sweet vicious little Bernadette\". Dan describes how she yelled at him and his grandson for losing the three-legged race at the company picnic. His grandson called her the mean little kid with the big boobies.Sheldon is showing the highlights of his \"Fun with Flags\" series where viewers have learned, laughed, wondered and even shed a tear or two while learning about flags. Amy appears in a kangaroo costume for Australia, Sheldon is dressed as Betsy Ross debunking her myth, both of them are on a beach in 1890's costumes talking about beach warning flags and Barry Kripke is a guest playing the game \"Fwag, not a Fwag\" as flashcards are presented to him. In the beach scene Amy keeps looking at Sheldon's legs.Leonard is reviewing some of Professor Abbot's notebooks that are full of numbers. He wants to find some time on the supercomputer to decode the notebooks. Howard agrees to help until he admits he has no idea how to decipher them. Raj tells him to talk to the fellow he shared the office with, Professor Sharp (Paul Wilson).At the banquet, Dan, Penny and Bernadette are sharing a table. Penny asks about Dan's grandson who is seven. Bernadette remembers him from the picnic crying like a wuss. Her Dad always said that the only ones who like cry babies are mommies and Democrats. Penny points out that she can be rough on people at times.LeVar Burton is back as FWF's guest. He is appearing under the assumption that Sheldon will erase his contact information in his presence. Sheldon shows LeVar the episode where he dressed up as George Washington Carver for Black History Month. His black-face tribute was called by Leonard \"wildly racist\".The guys visit Professor Sharp's apartment in a run-down building to discuss the notebooks Leonard had found. Raj thinks that they are some kind of interstellar coordinate system for an updated version of Hubble's Law. Sharp explains that it is a caloric diary Professor Abbot had kept under the assumption that restricting calories was the key to living forever. As to his physics work, Professor Abbot never accomplished anything significant.Penny continues to discuss Bernadette's personality. Bernadette says that she is tough, but that she isn't a bully. Penny replied that there is a difference between being tough and telling your friend that her new pants look like a saggy diaper. Bernadette wants to leave since she thinks that everybody hates her. People find her quite intimidating and she just has to show them how sweet she is.Sheldon finishes his final episode throwing a salute to all his \"flag-keteers.\" He wishes he could run them all up a flagpole and salute them. He thanks Amy and mentions that she is the first woman to co-host a flag or banner-related Internet show. Sheldon gets very sentimental as he signs off using his white flag as a handkerchief. Amy says that she thinks his sign-off was beautiful and all Sheldon can do is again ask her if she hit the record button.Professor Sharpe's office is now empty. As the guys are throwing out the last of his files, Leonard sighs that that is the end of Roger Abbott. Not everyone achieves something great in their lives. Some people just have to concentrate on the small moments that make up their lives, muses Howard; however, he doesn't have to worry about that because he went into \"space\". Since the leftover bottle of champagne was meant to celebrate a great discovery, the guys decide to open it when one of them makes one. They will toast Professor Abbot, celebrate their achievement and also rub their success in Sheldon's face.Penny and Bernadette approach Dan at the bar so she can apologize. Dan is nervous talking to her. Bernadette is sorry that she yelled at his grandson. Dan then tells her that the company is going to stop paying for everybody's coffee and that it started five months ago. No one wanted to tell her and everyone else has been paying for Bernadette's coffee by using the money from their \"Profanity Swear Jar\". They also gave her a private bathroom due to her attitude. Bernadette feels terrible and thinks that everyone sees her as a monster. Dan quips that she is like the cute one eyed one (Mike) from \"Monsters, Inc\". Bernadette breaks into tears and says that she wants to quit, but Penny says that the company needs her. Dan tells her that they will still pay for her coffee or even better get her an espresso machine. Bernadette sobs that that would be nice AND has found a new way to get what she wants.Leonard returns home late with the bottle of champagne. Sheldon is hunched over his laptop not getting any comments on his last FWF episode. Sheldon feels that his efforts were for nothing, not unlike Leonard throwing out all of Professor Abbot's life's work which showed no significant accomplishments. Then one short note arrives on his website that someone was sorry FWF had ended. \"The people are heartbroken!\" Sheldon is going to bring the series back. He wants to celebrate and opens up the 50 year old bottle even though the guys had other plans for it. He didn't want to drink it, he just wanted to hear the pop, though it still scared him.Finally, Sheldon visits LeVar's house knocking the usual three times. He wants LeVar to know that the show is back and LeVar can be his first guest. Wil Wheaton had told him to get a gate. Since LeVar was born in Germany would he like to help with an episode on German flags? And would he mind dressing up as a swastika? The door is slammed in his face.Title reference: Leonard, Raj and Howard think about their own careers when finding the champagne of a deceased colleague meant to celebrate a significant breakthrough.", "episode_3": "At Leonard's place Howard is practicing throwing a baseball virtually in front of the TV. Raj is throwing insults at him because heckling is a \"beloved part of baseball\", to which Sheldon agrees. The Los Angeles Angels wanted an astronaut to throw out the first pitch for Space Day. NASA asked him because a lot of others weren't available. Raj is throwing insults at Howard again, ruining his throw and hurting his feelings. Leonard tells Penny that this is why they're not playing outside like she told them to.Sheldon and Amy are returning from a dinner date where Sheldon asked if she enjoyed his lecture. His lecture was on the history of Cornwall, England because they were having Cornish game hen and the waiter should have been versed in that subject. Amy suggests they go to a movie the next night. Sheldon is behind in his number of date nights since he was away during the summer and has to make them up due to the Relationship Agreement. Penny sarcastically remarks, \"That is so hot.\" Amy finds it better than hot because it is binding. Leonard and Penny get invited to come though Sheldon changes his mind when he finds out that that doesn't count as two dates if another couple joins them.Bernie is impressed that Leonard wants to do throw a ball in front of a stadium full of people. Howard says that it's an honor that NASA asked him. Bernadette has played a lot of softball and offers to help him. She also wants him to practice running out to the pitcher's mound.Penny is getting ready and is surprised that Sheldon wants to go to a pub. He did not like Amy's idea of a picnic, but he knows that they serve Yorkshire pudding at the pub and can't wait to lecture the waiter about Yorkshire, England. Sheldon feels that Leonard is just jealous with how great the Shamy relationship is. Sheldon states that their relationship is superior to Leonard and Penny's. Sheldon rates the quality of the relationships in the Social Group: Sheldon/Amy, Howard/Bernadette, Raj and Emily, Penny/Chardonnay, Penny/Leonard. Leonard argues that you can't rank relationships. Penny also tells him that it's not Chardonnay, it's Sauvignon Blanc.At the Caltech gym, Howard admits that he never played baseball. Raj and Bernadette are setting up a 60-foot 6 inch distance (the regulation distance between the pitcher's mound and home plate in MLB) to help Howard practice throwing. Howard pulls it out as Bernadette reads the tape measure and keeps asking when to stop. He is very surprised at the final distance.While driving to the pub, Leonard asks Sheldon why he thinks his relationship with Amy is better than Leonard's with Penny. Sheldon tells him that they enjoy spending time together. Leonard replies that they spend hours doing separate things when they spend time together. Leonard is disgusted that Sheldon has to be the best at everything. Penny asks him why he even cares. Leonard also reminds them that they can't do anything without consulting their Relationship Agreement. Sheldon has no problem with contracts since the thirteen colonies entered into a relationship agreement called the U.S. Constitution which he considers still that love affair is still hot today.At the gym, Bernie tells him to look where he wants to throw, step toward where he wants to throw it and throw it. He takes so long warming up, Bernadette yells at him to just throw the ball and he throws it wild.At the pub, Amy wants to know when they are getting married. They haven't set a date and Penny wants to wait long enough to prove to her mother that she's not pregnant. Sheldon asks to have one of Amy's fries, but Amy is rejected when asking for a bite of Sheldon's hamburger. Sheldon reveals that there is avocado in the burger and Amy's allergy of it. Leonard still insists one can't quantify the quality of a relationship. Sheldon disagrees and rates Amy's French fry at a 7, Spider-man a 9 and the number 9 ironically only a 4. Leonard asks Penny how ridiculous that is and she rates it at 100. Leonard insists that he is just assigning random numbers based upon his opinion. Sheldon shows him the work of Ellen S. Berscheid, Snyder, and Omoto and their relationship scale based on closeness predicting the stability of a couple. The Shamy ranks 8.2 out of 10. Leonard wants to take the test with Penny firmly says that she doesn't want to. Penny leaves to get a drink at the bar and Leonard follows him.Back at the gym, Bernadette wonders if Howard is getting better. She tells Raj that its too late to cancel. A couple of wild pitches hit the wall to their right.Leonard goes over to the bar and asks Penny if she is mad at him. Penny doesn't want to take the test to get a score that will make her more worried since she is already worried about their relationship. They are engaged and she is worried that they have nothing in common which scares her. Leonard admits to having similar feelings. Penny yells at him that His blind infatuation with her is the rock that their relationship is built on.Howard seeks some advice from fellow astronaut Mike Massimino. Mike tells him to not do it since if he is successful no one cares and if he isn't, he will be an idiot on YouTube forever. Mike also wonders how he got a wife that is as cute as Bernadette.As Penny and Leonard return to the table, they apologize and Amy admits they should have never compared their relationships. Next he wants to go up against Raj and Cinnamon for a real challenge. Leonard tells Sheldon that just because they are two very different people, that doesn't make them a bad couple. Penny decides she wants to take the test. Leonard doesn't care what the score is. Marriage is scary, but that doesn't mean he doesn't want to do it. He wants to do it with Penny taking her hand and facing all their problems together. Penny is very touched.At the baseball game, the gang is in the bleachers, while Bernadette and Howard are on the field. Sheldon wants to watch the pitch and then head to Disneyland to see Mickey's Soundsational Parade. Amy tells him that if he stays, she'll get him some cotton candy and a bobble-head doll. On the pitcher's mound, Howard is given a microphone and a baseball. He tells the kids in the stadium how he didn't think he could do it and keeps trying until he really failed. But he is not an athlete, he is a scientist. Then he decided to have a working prototype of the Mars rover deliver the ball to home plate. That excites the crowd. The rover takes so long that the fans start booing.\nSheldon wants to leave, go to Disneyland and come back later to see the end of the pitch. The episode ends with the rover still moving slowly to the catcher as the fans continue booing.Title reference: Howard not being athletic enough to deliver the first pitch a Los Angeles Angels baseball game.", "episode_15": "Sheldon and Amy are eating lunch in Amy's lab and Sheldon tells her a science joke. \"How many Edison's does it take to screw in a light bulb? None; he stole the idea and doesn't deserve his own joke.\" Barry Kripke shows up with a thank-you gift for Amy, who helped him with a paper on string theory. Sheldon says that he'd like to read it and to send it to his Bazinga email ID (Bazinga electronic commerce website name was already taken). Sheldon wonders why Amy never offered to help him when he was working on string theory. Amy reminds him that she \"did\" offer to help him, but he stated that the only math biologists know is \"three frog minus one frog equals two frogs.\"Howard is on the phone talking to his mother, who is visiting Howard's Aunt Gladys in Florida. He remarks to Bernadette that she is finally in a place where everyone complains about how sweaty they are. Howard is not happy that his mother wants him to check in on Stuart. Howard just wants things to get back to normal between him and his mother.Sheldon is working on his laundry as Penny enters the laundry room and he explains that he is mad at Amy. Sheldon left string theory because he thought it was a dead end and by working with his rival, Amy may prove that he was wrong. Penny reminds him that he was always for the advancement of science; however, Sheldon is only interested in \"his\" advancement of science. Penny wants him to \"let it go\" and to talk to Amy.Leonard, Raj and Stuart are working in Stuart's new comic book store. Raj tells him that the place looks great and that he should have burnt it down years ago. Howard and Bernadette enter, and they both voice their appreciation for the new store... until Howard sees some of his mother's den furniture in it. This sets Howard off, who says that maybe Stuart should bring over everything else from the den including the clown art he made as a kid. Stuart shoots back that he must have spent ten whole minutes on it. Howard then retorts that maybe he should have gone to art school, opened up a failed comic book store, and mooched off somebody's mother.Penny and Sheldon are in her apartment as she folds laundry. Sheldon wants to know how to let something go. She advises him to think of something else, and he proceeds to think of a spiny anteater, though it still comes back to Kripke. Penny wants him to try visualization and to imagine his problems are a pen: he should hold the pen and then let it go; however, Sheldon imagines such a special pen that he doesn't want to get rid of it. He tries another approach, telling Penny that Amy has been giving her puzzles to compare Penny's intelligence to that of the monkeys in her lab. Penny denies it until she remembers (via flashbacks) Amy giving her some scissors to assemble, some coins to sort by size, and a banana in a Chinese puzzle box. She gets mad at Amy and Sheldon tells Penny to \"let it go\", and that he was rooting for Penny. Sheldon wants her to imagine a non-special pen, which gets him thrown out of her apartment.Howard and Bernadette are sitting on his mother's couch in the comic book store with Bernadette commiserating with Howard.\nBernadette reminds him that if the comic book store does well, Stuart will be able to move out of his mother's house. Howard reluctantly agrees, then says he married her so that she could blindly support him no matter how ridiculous he was.Raj and Leonard are at a deli picking up food for the comic book store party, when Raj spots Nathan Fillion sitting at a table eating his lunch. Raj suggests they ask him to do a guest signing at Stuart's new store. Raj approaches him and the man denies being an actor, then gets insulted when Raj tells him he's not that bad an actor. He again denies being who they think he is and tells them he just wants to eat his lunch.Amy arrives at Sheldon's apartment just as Penny comes out of hers. Penny, who's still mad at Amy, goes into full-on sarcasm mode, excitedly telling Amy that she got her door open all by herself, and to celebrate, she's going to throw some feces around her cage. Amy gets mad at Sheldon for telling Penny about the tests. Amy then offers Penny $5.00, which is what she paid each of the undergraduate students on which she performed the same intelligence test. Penny just wants her dignity back, so Amy offers her $10.00.Back at the deli, the man finally admits that he is Nathan Fillion, though a now-skeptical Raj wonders what he is doing eating alone in a deli. Nathan offers to have a picture taken with them, with Raj still skeptical. Nathan then asks if they want a picture of them with a guy that looks like an annoyed Nathan Fillion. That's good enough for Facebook, according to Raj, and the resulting picture shows a smiling Raj, a happy Leonard giving a thumbs-up, and an unsmiling, very annoyed Nathan Fillion.Leonard and Penny are now on the couch at the comic book store discussing how both Amy and Sheldon did experiments on both of them. Amy and Sheldon walk in and Leonard and Penny say how dare they experiment on their friends and that they don't mind hurting their friends' feelings. Howard comes in, still complaining, and Bernadette wants him to \"let it go\". Howard excuses himself to take a phone call while Amy asks how she can help make this up to Penny and Leonard. Bernadette tells Stuart that he could've warned Howard about using his mother's furniture, which Raj agreeing when he said it while helping him move it.\nHoward finishes his call and rejoins the gang, looking like he's in complete shock. his aunt just told him that his mother died after she took a nap and never woke up. Bernadette breaks into tears and hugs him tightly. Instead of being rude, Sheldon sincerely comments, \"When I lost my own father, I didn't have any friends to help me through it. You do.\" These comforting words cause Howard to smile while surprising the others such as Penny who gets broken up and remarks that she thought that he was going to say to \"let it go\".Later, the gang is back at Leonard and Sheldon's apartment. Howard is hanging in there, and they're leaving for Florida that night to attend the funeral. The gang reflects on Mrs. Wolowitz's passing. Stuart can't believe she's gone, and will always be grateful to her for taking him in in his time of need, as he would have been homeless otherwise. Raj is going to miss her, and reflects on how she made him feel welcomed when he first came to the United States (especially when she thought that Raj was the gardener the first few years). Penny reflects on how Mrs. Wolowitz had told her that she was too skinny and should eat more. Sheldon didn't like the way that she yelled, but will miss it. Leonard and the rest of the gang then toast Mrs. Wolowitz, saying she was a great mother to all of them (which doubled as a toast by the cast to their own \"mother,\" the late Carol Ann Susi, may she rest in peace.).Title reference: The reopening of the comic book store by Stuart and a reference to the regeneration process of Doctor Who.", "episode_5": "At the Caltech cafeteria, Raj describes a new invention that converts one's walking footsteps to electromagnetic energy so that a cell phone could be charged while walking. Leonard remembers that they had that idea years ago, but didn't pursue it. Every one of the guys has been distracted by their girls for years. Sheldon even admits that Amy is a distraction. The guys decide to have a weekend of brainstorming new ideas. Sheldon doesn't want to go to a cabin in the woods, a hotel, a lake house or a beach house due to scary movies he has seen.Leonard asks Penny if it's all right for him to blow off their Sunday brunch so the guys can spend a science retreat weekend. Without answering Leonard, Penny asks the girls if they want to spend the weekend in Vegas. Bernie and Amy get excited and start checking hotels, airplane flights and underwear (Amy)As the guys are setting up snacks and things, Raj joins them. Now with the girls gone and there are no distractions, they have 48 hours to come up with ways to change the world. Raj since they are innovating, he feels like he is in that Facebook movie with Justin Timberlake. Sheldon has it so they decide to make popcorn and watch it. They start going through and old list of invention ideas that mainly involve robot girlfriends and other sex toys which are pages of them. They decide to come up with a new idea. Many inventions have come out of science fiction books and movies according to Sheldon. Arthur C. Clark described geosynchronous satellites, the Motorola flip-phone was just like the Star Trek communicator and Sheldon feels that the idea of a colored president came from the movie \"Deep Impact\". The movie \"Back To The Future part 2\" took place in 2015, the next year, so they decided to work on one of the futuristic inventions from that film like hover-boards. After starting to discuss how to invent one, they end up watching the movie.In Vegas, the girls are all dressed up ready to go out. Amy wants to go see the lounge band that plays Barry Manilow music. Penny wants to down a bucket of margaritas, throw up all over the roulette wheel and watch it fly everywhere. Penny then gets a text from her boss that they moved her field ride up to Monday and that she now only has two days to prepare for it. She tells Bernadette and Amy to go on out and that she'll catch up with them later while she tries to get a start on her background material.Back in Apartment 4A, the guys are watching BTTFP2 together. Howard pauses the movie because he doesn't understand the changes in the film's time-line. If Biff Tannen delivers the sports almanac to his younger self, how can he return to the future where Marty McFly and Emmett \"Doc\" Brown already are? He should return to the alternate future that was affected by the changes that his younger self made. Sheldon keeps arguing about the tenses of events that take place on alternate time-lines. Leonard reminds them that they sent the girls away so they could focus. Sheldon adds that it didn't seem to work.Amy and Bernie are drinking two very large margaritas. Bernadette is proud that Penny is taking her job so seriously. No matter how good looking Penny is, Amy thinks that both of them are rocking, especially Bernadette. Amy wants to know how large her breasts are. Amy is embarrassing Bernadette.The guys have moved onto Leonard's lab to work with fewer distractions. Leonard and Howard discuss how they could use Maglev technology to make the hover-board work. They also consider using super-cooling materials and quantum coupling techniques and go online to check it out. Instead they find a map of Austria and decide that it does look like a wiener. Sheldon suggests that they use some conditioning techniques to punish them and keep them focused. Similar work was used to get pigeons to learn to play ping-pong. Next they are seen watching pigeons play ping-pong. Leonard then stops them and suggests they need a punishment technique. Howard suggests snapping a rubber band on their wrist when they stray. Sheldon mentions torture devices and then goes on Amazon to find one.Penny is back in their hotel room busy on her laptop, when Amy and Bernadette come stumbling through the door after pretending to be from housekeeping. Penny is glad they are having fun. Bernadette over tipped her waitress when she realizes she is missing her $100 gambling chip. Amy wants them to go to a club with Australian male strippers. Bernadette wants to know if they twirl their junk in the opposite direction. Amy calls the over-studying Penny a nerd and wants her to come with them. Amy offers to help Penny by quizzing her and then steals her laptop telling her that it'll be at the strip club. Bernadette wonders why she is not chasing Amy. Amy ran into the walk-in closet.The guys decide to torture each other by putting duct tape on their arms and tearing off arm hair when anyone gets off-topic. They believe that their discussing about the duct tape is off topic and they start torturing each other. Leonard then concludes that negative reinforcement is not going to help them. Sheldon corrects him that it's positive punishment. Bill Murray made the same mistake at the beginning of the \"Ghostbusters\" movie. They pull up the clip and Sheldon is right. Howard wants to watch the scene with the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man. Leonard again tries to get them to again think about work. Why should they stand around his lab watching \"Ghostbusters\" on some crappy laptop? Sheldon agrees that they shouldn't, so they go back to the apartment to watch the whole movie. Who ya going to call? GHOSTBUSTERS!!Among the loud music at the strip joint, Bernadette is slipping a bill into a dancer's G-string while Penny is still studying. Bernadette asks if Amy has ever seen a body like that. Amy has seen a lot of good ones in her anatomy class, but none of them move like these guys. Penny keeps on studying.Finally, the next morning Penny is relaxed and heading to the pool, while Bernie and Amy are hung-over. She reminds them that only nerds and losers stay in the room. She opens the drapes to show them how bright it is and then decides not to close them. Bernadette groans and asks Amy to close the drapes. She agrees, rolls off the bed and ends up passing out on the floor.Title reference: The weakening of the men's focus on their work due to their other halves.", "episode_4": "The guys are in the Caltech cafeteria talking about a project to mutate chicken DNA and create a chicken dinosaur which Sheldon finds fascinating. Sheldon says that a chicken dinosaur salad sandwich would be totally Mesozoic. Raj reminds them that Leonard and Penny finally get to meet his girlfriend Emily (Laura Spencer).

Emily is a resident at Huntington Hospital and Sheldon immediately makes an appointment with Emily to have some freckles checked out on his butt. Emily also agrees to take a sales call from Penny to help her practice with a real doctor.The posse is at Penny's place discussing Emily and Penny doesn't think that she likes her. No one ever says they don't like you to your face according to Penny though Amy lived a completely different life from her. Penny had a P.E. teacher that she didn't think liked her and it turned out she liked her too much and she got an \"A\" after attending a Melissa Etheridge concert. Amy can't believe Penny went through her entire life without anyone saying they didn't like her to her face; she would say it if Penny didn't have such nice cheekbones.The guys are visiting Capitol Comics Store since Stuart's place is still closed wishing he would reopen. Raj tells them that he may not reopen since the insurance company settlement wasn't enough and he hasn't begun to rebuild. Leonard suggests that they put up the money Stuart needs becoming part-owners. The idea sounds appealing. Sheldon wants to purchase the comic book store, spread a rumor that coming there will give you genital warts, and then buy a large sack to contain all the money.Penny shows up at Emily's office with coffee and Chai tea. Emily says that she is busy and wants her to start. Penny starts describing her company's birth control pills and Emily pays no attention to her. Penny stops and asks if there is a problem between them. Emily reluctantly tells Penny that she knows that the two of them are casually hooked-up. Penny reluctantly admits that it was a brief hook-up.In Apartment 4A, the guys discuss how to set their retail store apart from the competition. Leonard says that kids like them so maybe they should find a way to get them into their store. Howard had problems getting to the comic book store as a child, so Raj's idea is to get a van and drive around the neighborhood picking up children. Leonard asks sarcastically if they are going to use candy to lure them into the van.\nPenny storms in complaining to Raj about what he told Emily. Raj says that he tells everyone what happened to them. Penny states categorically that they only fooled around. Sheldon says that that is one friend down and one to go. Raj snaps that Sheldon is next.The posse is again talking about Emily. Penny doesn't care that she slept with Raj, because all girls have a past. Amy clears her throat to indicate that she doesn't have any. Penny doesn't know how you can just get someone to like you. Amy suggests hanging around her and acting like she is her friend until you wear her down. Before you know it, you're in her house, eating her food and drinking her wine. [Just like Amy]. Penny dismisses the idea. Bernadette tells her to use her sales training to sell \"Penny\". After Penny dismisses that idea, Bernadette cracks that maybe more people would like her if she didn't crap all over their ideas. Amy sides with Penny since they go way back. Amy shushes her, strokes her cheek and says that Amy is here now. Still has that girl crush on Penny.At Capitol Comics Store, Sheldon and Howard are thinking over the great times they could have had if they owned a comic book store. Leonard wonders out loud whether Penny ever left anyone off of her list of former lovers. Sheldon says that she must have or she would still be reciting the list. Howard reassures him that he is the one that Penny wants to marry and he thinks that complete honesty is not the best thing in relationships.Leonard talks to Penny about investing in the comic book store, who wonders why they should even be talking about finances. They are getting married. Then Penny wonders if mounds of credit card debt will affect them financially.Next, Howard mentions an investment opportunity to Bernadette who immediately says \"nope\". They are saving up for a house and it sounds \"risky.\" Howard then mentions that he used to go to the comic book store with his Dad and Bernie changes her mind even though she knows he made up the story.Finally, Sheldon talks to Amy saying that he is very excited about this project and if she isn't also excited, it could throw their relationship into jeopardy. Amy asks Sheldon if a grown man and an accomplished scientist would be wasting his time and intellect on a store that sells picture books of men flying around in their underwear. Sheldon says \"no\", so Amy agrees that it is a great idea.At Penny's apartment, Raj and Emily enter. Emily apologizes for being so rude in her office the other day. Raj loves both of them friend-wise and hopes that they can get along. Penny tells her that their fling was a long time ago and that she is engaged now. Emily tells her that they're fine.Howard and Bernadette are visiting Stuart at his mother's house. Howard proposes that his friends invest in his store so he can open up. Stuart thanks him, but Howard's mother gave him the money to rebuild his business. She'll do anything to help her little Bubala. Howard charges up the stairs telling his mother that she is canceling that check and that he's her Bubala; however, she is out buying Stuart shirts at Target.Raj and Emily are getting ready to leave saying that they are glad that they worked everything out between them. The two couples plan to have dinner together soon. Right between Penny's door, both women say, \"I hate her.\"The guys are disappointed that their comic book store dream did not come true. They wish that they could have had a place where they could sit down and read their comic books in peace in big comfy chairs. They don't realize that that is exactly what they are doing in Apartment 4A.Title reference: Emily's reaction to Raj and Penny having \"slept together\" in the season 4 finale.", "episode_7": "The girls are having tea and Bernadette tells them that she has been picked as one of the fifty sexiest scientists in California for a magazine article. Amy thinks the news is awful because Bernadette is a successful microbiologist and should be celebrated for her achievements and not her looks. Penny disagrees since she does flirt with her clients to sell the product.On the stairwell, Sheldon runs into a middle-aged man carrying roses, Dr. Oliver Lorvis (Billy Bob Thornton), whom Sheldon mistakes as a deliveryman. He is actually a doctor who is delivering the flowers to a female pharmaceutical sales rep who was very flirty with him. He thinks he can impress her since he tracked her down on the Internet and shows up to her door with flowers. He walks up to Penny's door.In 4A, Sheldon mentions the guy with flowers calling on Penny. Leonard approaches the doctor and Lorvis explains They met in his office on a sales call and he was hoping to initiate a romantic relationship. She winked at him seductively and touched his arm for two Mississippi's. Leonard explains that he must be mistaken since Leonard is engaged to Penny. The doctor didn't see her wearing an engagement ring. The other guys exclaim \"Really,\" as they are eating their dinner and watching Leonard's predicament. The doctor concludes that she was just trying to make a sale. The same thing happened to him with a cute girl at a pet store when he bought a $2000 iguana habitat. She touched his arm for five Mississippi's. He gives the flowers to Leonard to give to Penny and calls Leonard a lucky man. He walks away looking sad so Sheldon invites him in for a hot beverage. Leonard says that he tried to score with Penny. Sheldon snaps back that so have Howard and Raj and they are still having dinner with them.Amy and Bernadette are at a bar having wine discussing the day's events. Bernadette says that the magazine canceled the article she was to be in which should make Amy happy. Amy then admits that she wrote an email complaining about the article since they would not have written about male scientists exploiting their sexuality. Bernadette is angry that Amy got jealous and took away her chance to get some publicity. Also she thinks that Amy doesn't want her to express her sexuality since no one would ask Amy to do it. Amy gets insulted and leaves.Sheldon gives the doctor his tea, who is impressed by the Star Trek mug. He mentions that he has one of the original series phasers because Gene Roddenberry needed a vasectomy. The doctor turns out to be a celebrity urinary specialist. He carries around James Cameron's kidney stones. James Cameron was so happy to get those out that he gave him a terminator. The doctor offers to show them his collection. Originally Dr. Lorvis thought it would be a good way to meet women, but that didn't work out. Then he wants to know how Leonard got a girl like Penny.\nPenny shows up and is surprised to see the doctor. Leonard describes her flirting without her engagement ring on. Penny is embarrassed and upset since she is not supposed to see her clients after hours though the doctor is her biggest client. Leonard confronts Penny in the hallway who says that she does flirt to make sales. She also lets them think that she is a single person by not showing off her engagement ring.\nLeonard feels that Lorvis is harmless and a nice guy, but Penny still wants him to get rid of him since she can't fraternize with clients. The other guys are off to see this great movie prop collection and Leonard joins them.The guys enter a room full of like-size movie mannequins, vintage quarter video games, posters and other assorted moving props including a large iguana habitat. The doctor welcomes them to his fortress of solitude. Leonard finds his favorite video game, Donkey Kong.

Sheldon mentions the article and Leonard thinks that they hated it. The article did praise their work, but didn't mention Leonard. Sheldon tries to help lose his anger by giving him a massage which Leonard doesn't want. \"Cooper and his team?\" exclaims Leonard. Leonard says that the bright side is that they are talking about the theory. Sheldon agrees that that is what is important like when Stan Lee and Steve Ditko created Spider-Man and only Stan Lee is ever mentioned, gets all the money, is in the all the movies, etc. Leonard is very unhappy.At his mother's house, Stuart is still living there. Stuart tells Howard that the power is going to be out until the next day. After ask how long after the power out, Howard runs to check the freezer and finds the food defrosting.

To use up all the food, Howard decides to invite everyone over for a meal. It will be like his mother is feeding them one last time.In Penny's place, Leonard is still depressed over his name being excluded. Penny wonders who even reads Scientific American especially with no celebrity on the cover. She is going to cheer him up by going online to shop for him. Leonard says that that is her cheering up thing until she finds a helicopter with a camera making him feel better. Sheldon comes in after talking to the author of the article who has been following his work for years and only did the article because Sheldon's name was connected with it. Also they made an editorial decision to only list the lead author. Also Howard called to invite them over for dinner.On the way to the Wolowitz house, both Sheldon and Leonard are complaining to their girls about the magazine article. Amy tells Sheldon that is was Leonard's idea; however, Sheldon has ideas all the time. i.e. Reverse SeaWorld where dolphins pet people. Was it his fault that he has a bigger reputation or that his name came first? Then he asked if it was his fault that he didn't correct the author and Amy starts looking the pretty bird off to her left. Leonard is upset that Sheldon is willing to let everyone think that he did all the work.In the kitchen, Raj, Bernadette and Howard start to prepare their meal. He finds strange things in the freezer like cake from his Bar Mitzvah and his prom boutonniere. The meal consists of three briskets, four meatloaf, Jewish ravioli (noodle strudel), two pound cakes, a tub of matzo ball soup and no vegetables. His mother thought she could cure any sickness with her cooking including the time Howard got food poisoning from it.

Howard declines, saying he wants to go ahead with the dinner.Stuart escorts the guys into the living room lit by candles and menorahs. Penny thinks everything looks beautiful. Sheldon comes in, says hello and then \"Hello, Leonard\" who has to be mentioned by name. Howard tells everyone that this is not a sad occasion and that they are going to have the kind of dinner they have had so many times before including the heartburn. The girls tell the guys to behave themselves which they agree to.At the table, the food is found to be delicious even though there are not vegetables. Howard corrects them that he has tomatoes in the packets of catsup. Amy feels like they are in an 18th-century French salon due to the candle lighting. Sheldon describe to Penny that the French salon is where intellectuals talk about the issues of the day. Penny compares it to The View. Amy tells Sheldon what \"The View\" is, which Sheldon is aware of. Whoopi Goldberg is on it as she was on Star Trek: The Next Generation.\nThe topic of female equality among super heroes comes up, since in the revamped Marvel universe, Thor (mispronounced Tor) is going to be a woman. Amy quips that there won't be equality until Thor is a mother and the others are fine with her pumping out breast milk at work.\nLeonard complains that Sheldon would prefer execution over inspiration like with their paper. Howard favors execution since he is an engineer bringing concepts to reality. Sheldon agrees; however, Leonard notes that Sheldon always tears down Howard and engineering as a profession. Penny wants them to stop because if she wanted to hear curse words, she would go to her real hair salon. Sheldon and Leonard really start to fight, with Leonard even threatening to throw his food at Sheldon. Bernadette stops things before they can escalate before she gets angry and demands that Sheldon and Leonard go into the living room. She is heard yelling at the top of her voice that Howard is dealing with the loss of his mother. Howard wants to know if they think that she sounds like his mother. Everyone says that they never noticed.Finally everyone is overstuffed and lying around the living room. Penny doesn't think she ever ate that much food in her entire life. Sheldon finds out that the research paper was mentioned in Physics Today and that Leonard was credited. An unenthusiastic \"yay\" is heard. Bernadette comes down the steps saying that she found more Tums for their upset stomachs and a more enthusiastic \"yay\" is heard.Title reference: All the leftovers that are going to spoil if they are not cooked.", "episode_19": "Sheldon is working on the opening joke for their lecture on Leonard's theory at University of California, Berkley.. Sheldon also has a PRK or Public Restroom Kit stocked with everything he needs including toilet paper and a mirror to check under the stalls for weirdos.Sheldon and Leonard are on their way to give a lecture at UC Berkeley and have plenty of time. Sheldon plays a game of \"I can't spy\" which includes sub-atomic particles. Leonard guesses the type of subatomic particle and the number of them right away so Sheldon does want to play anymore. They both think it's cool to be on a road trip and presenting a paper at another university together. Sheldon is so happy he's going to let Leonard turn on the radio and listen to music. He tells him to \"Play that funky music white boy\", but never heard of the song his reference came from.At Howard's mother's house, the rest of the gang is preparing for a garage sale from the items in the garage. Amy is in charge of pricing since she has been going to garage sales forever. Raj finds a ping-pong table which Howard used to play with his Transformers. Raj and Penny used to play, while Amy only served since she had no one to play with. Howard is upset that Bernadette is planning on selling his Doctor Who TARDIS. He wants to save it until it's worth half what he paid for it. Bernadette doesn't want it moved into the house.Listening to the radio Sheldon hears the \"Play your funky music, white boy,\" Sheldon is confused because they are asking the white boys to play it and yet the white boys are listening to this funky music. It's a paradox so Sheldon turns it off since music should be fun and not contradictory. Due to being ahead of schedule, they decide to head to Star Wars director George Lucas' headquarters at Skywalker Ranch and see if they can get in. Sheldon gets \"so excited, that he just can't hide it\".Penny and Raj are playing ping-pong, though not too competitively. Bernadette wants to update the house to tasteful modern instead of Hebrew mother taste. Amy talks about pricing the TARDIS, while Howard still wants to keep it. Bernadette suggests that they arm wrestle for it. Raj suggests ping-pong. Bernadette doesn't think that's fair since he grew up with it, though he just used it as a Transformer-Thunder-cats battlefield. Penny offers to play for Bernie because of all of the \"Doctor Who\" episodes Leonard has made her sit through. Howard chooses Raj since he was a champion boy's school badminton player.Leonard drives up to the Skywalker Ranch gate and is in awe of it though it is so plain. Sheldon wants to try and get in. Leonard uses the speaker box and tells the Security guard that they are big fans, but not the crazy type that have a backpack filled with duct tape and rope. The guard can't hear them and buzzes them in.Next they reach the security guard shack and Sheldon says they have defeated the first quest. Leonard insists that they are trying to meet George Lucas, not slay a dragon. He just wants to be honest with the guard. As a back-up plan Sheldon hopes that they have a nurse's office which will work as long as Leonard has a willingness to be gently stabbed. Leonard tells the guard that they don't have an appointment, but they're really scientists and big fans. The security guard won't let them in. Sheldon claims that he does the voice-over for Yoda. The security guard says no, but offers them free hats and t-shirts as souvenirs. Sheldon jumps out of the car and runs in. Other guards chase him and he gets tasered in front of Leonard.Penny is playing Raj and is losing 8 to 4. Bernadette tells Raj if he wins the TARDIS can be moved to his apartment. It would look great as his front door since the TARDIS is \"bigger on the inside\". Raj decides to lose. Howard demands a new champion and wants Amy to play for him. She claims to be rusty, but has a fast powerful serve that throws Penny. Bernadette chooses Raj to replace Penny.Sheldon and Leonard are now being held in a detention room with another guy. Leonard sarcastically says that Imperial officers will probably take them to a holding cell in the Death Star. Sheldon asks the other guy what he was in for. He wanted to get in and say thank-you to George Lucas for creating a world where he fit in. He also tried to make-out with a Chewbacca statue. The guard lets them go with a warning, but they are not to return or they will be arrested. Also, they will have their picture taken for posting in the guard shack. The Wookie-kissing guy wants to know if he will get the same treatment. But the guard will not let him off so lightly. Sheldon wants to know if he can have his picture taken with George Lucas. After getting a dubious look from the guard, Sheldon says in his best Yoda voice impression, \"Quite grumpy, you are.\"The match is eleven points. Raj can't return Amy's power serve and Amy can't return Raj's serves. The game goes to 10-10. Final point would allow Howard to keep his TARDIS until Bernadette convinces Amy that if she loses, she can have the TARDIS, replace her bedroom door with the box's door and lure Sheldon into her bed. So Amy throws the game and Howard loses. The door is installed as Amy's bedroom door. Bernadette tells her that if the TARDIS doesn't get Sheldon into her bedroom, then nothing will.Leonard is climbing the stairs mad at Sheldon because they almost got arrested and missed their chance to give their lecture. And they were held in a room with a Wookiee crazy sex fiend. Sheldon's upside is that they got onto Skywalker Ranch which no one they know has done and with all the times he has irritated Leonard, he got him hit with a taser.Sheldon, dressed as the Fourth Doctor, runs into Amy's bedroom claiming that they have to \"reset the time circuits\" and finds Amy on her bed. He claims he left his sonic screwdriver outside and runs back out to get it. Amy realizes that she didn't think her plan through.Title reference: Sheldon and Leonard's intrusion on Skywalker Ranch.", "episode_21": "In the Caltech cafeteria, Sheldon tells Leonard and Howard that he has been working on songs and changing the lyrics to get kids interested in the hard sciences. To the the tune of \"B-I-N-G-O\" he substitutes the name of physicist James Clark Maxwell. Leonard stops him when he removes the first letter of his name by clapping thus start the final seventeen verses. The second song was to \"The Itsy Bitsy Spider\" explaining in the song that it is not an insect since it has eight legs and a body with two parts. Leonard thinks that that one was cool.\nRaj joins them and starts talking about a NASA project to try to contact alien lifeforms. Raj had been asked to put in a proposal for a message and a delivery system and asked the guys if they wanted to help. Sheldon and Howard start spouting out ideas until Raj gets mad that they aren't asking him for ideas. He just wants to work with Leonard whom he considers a gentleman.Leonard shows up at Raj's apartment excited to work on Raj's project. Raj is glad to have him since the others would have taken over the project and bossed them around. Just that morning, Sheldon wouldn't let Leonard put almond flavored soy milk on his Grape Nuts because the tastes conflicted. Leonard is all ready to begin though Raj who is in charge doesn't know how to start his project.Penny approached the door of Apartment 4A, does a triple knock and smiles at her little joke. Leonard was not there, though Penny came to talk to Sheldon. He thought that that was nice and his favorite topics are quantum mechanics, trains, flags... Penny seeks advice on whether she should try out for the movie. That's not on Sheldon's Task list. Penny explains that she has to decide whether to take the audition and risk the job she likes if she should happen to get the movie. Sheldon knows what she should do, but can't tell her since earlier the guys told him that he tends to force his ideas on people and he is trying to turn over a new leaf.Howard is in his late mother's kitchen making molecule-size cocktails contained in a pill size sphere. He offers on to Bernadette who has to put it in her mouth and pop it like a zit. She decides to have a beer instead. First Howard takes a picture of them and his mini-cocktail to send to Raj whom he had planned to do it with. He just wanted him to feel bad since he wasn't working on the space project with him. She then tells him that he is a leader and then tricks him into cleaning up the kitchen by himself. \"That's my big boss man.\"Back in apartment 4A, the topic is still trains and Sheldon is explaining about the cow catcher on antique locomotives. Penny then asks Sheldon that if she were in a train station and one train took her to her current job and the other one to an acting job, which train should she get on? Sheldon suggest a third train that goes to the audition and then she puts off a career decision until after she gets the part. Penny agrees with him and calls him a wise man.Discussing their project, Leonard and Raj mention the Voyager gold record that was sent for aliens, but they needed to build a record player to listen to it. E.T. built a phone out of an umbrella and a Speak-and-Spell. Changing the subject, they want something simple that doesn't require outside machinery. Animals use their other senses to deliver messages like scent and touch. They could send out a system that has a video message and also delivers it in a matter that uses the sense of touch. This idea was also the one that Howard and Sheldon had.Back at the Caltech cafeteria, Sheldon is demonstrating a song to Howard about animal senses to the tune of \"The Eye of the Tiger\" from \"Rocky 3\". Leonard and Raj join them and ask Sheldon and Howard to join the project. Leonard and Raj want them back because their idea sounded great. After Sheldon and Howard are back on the team, Leonard says that they should all get together tonight. Sheldon insists that it should be Raj's decision since it's his project. Raj wants to start immediately; however, Sheldon isn't available until tonight.Penny shows up at the audition talking to herself that she can do this. She wonders why she ever gave it up, enters the casting room and finds twenty other blonde actresses also applying for the part.Raj is explaining how they are going to work. The next speaker must respect what the last one had just said and build on it. Sheldon says he is going to build on it and now wants to order dinner. Raj and Leonard want them to get back on topic, but all they talk about is dinner.Another actress recognizes Penny and asks where she has been. She tells her about her new job. Now she can act that inflamed heart is only a mild side effect. She does miss acting sometimes, while the other woman is sick of the humiliation and being treated like a piece of meat. She gets called and immediately perks up. \"Wish me luck.\" The actress next to Penny says that she is sure she is pushing forty and everything is fake. Penny remembers starting that rumor.After having decided on the delivery system they start to discuss the message. The Pioneer probe showed a naked man and woman though Sheldon thought that that showed to predator races how soft and squishy we are. Raj prefers a person waving and holding the severed head of a tiger. Howard thinks thinks that a passive-aggressive message is ridiculous. Their squabble includes going to San Diego Comic-Con as Jabba the Hutt and Leonard was the tail, Howard took Sheldon to NASA in Texas, Leonard and Sheldon went to Skywalker Ranch and Sheldon spent the night with James Earl Jones. In each example, Sheldon came out on top and loved it; therefore, when he is in charge, good things happen. Leonard insists that Raj is in charge.At Penny's place, she explains to the girls how much she had forgotten how much she hated that world. The anxiety, the depression, the negativity. She felt she did a lousy reading for the part and then walked out. She never properly thanked Bernie for getting her her job. Bernadette suggests that Penny take her out to dinner as a more proper thank-you. Amy adds she should be invited too since they were discussing it in front of her. Penny cheerfully agrees.Finally, a fleet of alien spaceships cruise by. A couple of extra-terrestrials with tentacles are watching Sheldon in his video. As the image changes, a 3D simulator full of pins also shows the image. Sheldon tells the universe where to find our planet. They think that the soft pink creature looks quite delicious and they want to feast upon him just like Sheldon thought they would.Title reference: The breakdown of communication among the guys because of Raj's project and the attempt to communicate with aliens.", "episode_23": "While setting up dinner, Leonard, Sheldon, Penny and Amy are discussing the upcoming the visits of the guys' mothers to see them get an award. Sheldon is preparing a bowl of yellow roses for his mother. If Amy asks for roses, then he calls them a \"bouquet of severed plant genitals\". Sheldon did get her a rotting log that produced mushrooms for Valentine's Day (Amy points out that while flowers die, a moist rotting log will produce mushrooms for 2-3 years). Penny wonders if she should get something for Beverly (Christine Baranski) since she is not that excited about her relationship with Leonard. Leonard suggests her getting a Ph.D. overnight. Will the two different women get along? One is brilliant while the other is sweet and simple according to Sheldon.Sheldon is having tea with his mother Mary (Laurie Metcalf) who is proud of both of them, but can't understand the research paper they wrote about understanding the universe as an n-dimensional super-fluid.

Sheldon does love her, but is embarrassed by the things that she believes, does and says.Leonard and his mother are climbing the stairs, while she asks about a wedding date. After seeing each other for seven years, she wonders if the sex between them is satisfactory.

Bernadette doesn't mind him living there, but among the rules, he has to wear pants.Mary tells Beverly that she must be very proud of her son. She replies that he is arguing his first legal case in front of the Supreme Court. \"He did?\" asks Mary. \"Oh, you mean Leonard?,\" says Beverly. Sheldon starts to show Beverly the math he worked out for his hypothesis. Beverly wonders when Mary first knew that Sheldon was going to have such a remarkable mind. When he was thirteen he tried to build the nuclear reactor to supply electricity for the whole town because he was always concerned about the well-being of others. To power the reactor he had arranged to get some yellow cake (uranium) from a warlord in Chad (Africa). His mother thought he was getting some Twinkies from a local friends. Leonard wants his mother to tell the story about how he made a Van De Graff generator out of their vacuum cleaner. Beverly merely says that he broke the vacuum cleaner.Howard and Raj are playing a video game in the living room, while Stuart is reading a magazine and wearing pants.

She wants them to clean the kitchen from top to bottom including Raj who is doing his laundry at their house.Sheldon is showing Beverly pictures of when he got his bachelor of science degree. Penny pops in the door and apologizes that she got caught up at work. Penny shows off her engagement ring that Sheldon announces was made from a re-purposed diamond drill bit. Leonard tells Penny that it came from Tiffany's, though Sheldon is sure that only the box came from that store.Entering Leonard's room, Sheldon wonders if he misspoke abut the ring. Leonard confirms it and he feels that Sheldon is hogging the attention from both mothers like a seal pup or a \"Super Weaner\". Leonard does think he is being a super wiener. Sheldon feels that the situation is like when two mothers faun over the same pup making him a \"double mother Suckler\"Penny admits that they aren't in any rush to set the date for the wedding. Mary tells her it doesn't matter and that the moment a woman lays with a man, they are married in the eyes of the Lord. Beverly apologizes and says that she forgets how much a person's superstitions mean to them. Mary counters that she read Beverly's books that Sheldon sent her about superegos and ids and she wonders what bull dropped that on the barn floor. Sigmund Freud. Mary's bearded guy teaches love and compassion while Freud wants to talk about why you want to hold your poop and crawl back into your Mamma.\nWhile driving to church and pregnant with Shelly, she prayed that her son was smarter than his dumb-ass daddy and she saw a bobble-head of Jesus in the next car nodding yes. Penny wants to change the subject to shoes or how cute tiny Chinese babies are.The Wolowitz household guys are cleaning out the kitchen. Raj is working on the refrigerator. Raj tells Howard that Bernie should stop babying him like his mother did. Howard agrees and that he has to start acting like an adult in their marriage. He decides to take out the garbage. Picking up the bag, it splits, spilling the contents all over the floor.Beverly and Sheldon are having tea in a cafe and Beverly apologizes for upsetting Mary. Beverly also mentions she can't help but notice how Mary's unconditional love for Sheldon is diametrically opposed to her own parenting style. Sheldon describes her style has doling out affection as a reward for achievement, a proven way to raise a child or train a rat. Sheldon still turned out very successful under his loving mother. Leonard's brother and sister are very successful under Beverly's style while Sheldon's brother and sister are mouth breathing idiots.Leonard and Penny are talking to Mary as Leonard complains that he never got any love or affection from his mother for just being himself and that he always had to earn it. Penny assures him that he doesn't have to earn her love and he knew that when he bought her that princess drill bit diamond ring. Mary plans to apologize to Beverly just like a good Christian, though a real Texan would have shot her.Howard is finished cleaning up the big sticky mess of the garbage spill. Bernadette comes in and tells them how impressed she is that they did everything by themselves. Howard agrees, but then first his shoe and then his sock sticks to the floor, much to Bernadette's amusement.Beverly and Mary shake hands and agree to respect each other's beliefs. And Mary will pray for her. Beverly admits that she always made Leonard earn his affection, but she wants to initiate a new protocol to shower him with unconditional love.

He has been singled out by taxonomists as the weird kid on the playground. Leonard points out that a gibbon doesn't even know it's an ape, yet alone a gibbon. Sheldon commiserates with Howard that he has it worse than the gibbon.Bernadette and Amy enter Penny's apartment with snacks for their movie. Penny is cleaning out her closet since she needs room for all her new business clothes. Among other items, Amy comes across Penny's prom dress.

Amy says \"easy\" and Bernadette says sexually promiscuous. Penny corrects them and says that the term is \"popular\".\nAmy didn't go to her prom, but was on the clean-up crew. The DJ let her dance with her mop to \"The Lady in Red\". Bernadette's date liked her friend and he spent the whole prom talking to her friend. Bernadette figures that Penny went with the captain of the football team. Penny denies it and only made out with him while his date got sick. Bernadette suggests that they have a prom do-over. They could fix up the roof, make the guys wear tuxedos, slow dance and fix up their hair. Penny has been to 7 proms. The themes were four \"Under the Seas\", two \"Enchanted Evenings\" and one \"Night to Remember\" which Penny ironically can't remember.Howard joins Leonard, Sheldon, Penny and Raj for take-out in Apartment 4A. Raj has wanted to go to a prom ever since he saw \"Pretty in Pink\" and then changed his mind after seeing \"Carrie\". He changed his mind again after seeing \"Never Been Kissed\". According to Howard, Bernadette is so excited that her voice got high enough for the beagle next door to start howling. Sheldon did not go to his prom because he had a date with a good education, and due to skipping middle school and high school. Penny thinks that the whole idea is lame. Leonard feels that it is neat to even go to a fake prom with a woman as beautiful as Penny.At their place, Bernie is on her laptop telling Howard that everyone accepted their invitations. Even Stuart is bringing a date. Howard then calls up Stuart telling him that he can't take it because he is dating his mom. Stuart tells him to not worry because he is bringing a date. Then is he cheating on his mother? Stuart corrects Howard that nothing weird is going on between the two of them.Sheldon knocks on Penny's door more than three times. Just in case he is in a rush someday and could use a few in the bank. Penny asks if he will be participating in any post-prom mating rituals.

Sheldon is now officially interested in the prom do-over.Leonard is helping Sheldon fix the tie on his tuxedo; he mentions that Sheldon could use a clip-on tie. The tie looks perfect which pleases Sheldon since he wants everything for his first prom to go right. Sheldon gets out a flask. He is going to spike the punch though only with pomegranate juice. Also, he plans to have his picture taken, slow dance and get elected prom king, though being king is a hereditary title and not an elected position. Leonard tells him not to feel any pressure about having sex even though all his friends are. Sheldon begins to worry.Leonard and Sheldon go over to Penny's to pick up the girls. Penny is wearing her old red prom dress and Leonard thinks she looks amazing, as she does with him. Amy is wearing a turquoise dress and tells Sheldon that he looks handsome. Sheldon begins to stress out and excuses himself, claiming that he can't do it.Howard, Bernadette, Raj and Emily are in a limo having champagne. Bernadette says that she likes Cinderella.

The guys' \"good\" news is that they have already ordered lunch and the four of them can play the Lord of the Rings version of Risk for the next eight hours. The girls want them to agree to do something they want to do since they usually do what the guys want to do like video game nights, game night and watching movies with director commentaries. Even Sheldon agrees to let the girls decide. Penny suggests horseback riding (Kaley's hobby), but Amy has a narrow pelvis as a direct result of riding a thin pony and falling off after hitting a bump. Amy wants to do basket weaving at a Wilshire Boulevard craft store. Penny then insists that they find something that the guys will hate to do since she went with Leonard to the Dr. Who convention. Sheldon starts to make suggestions because he is a problem solver; he suggests ice skating to trigger Leonard's asthma and bring out his fear of Zambonis.At Howard and Bernadette's Apartment, Raj is worried about the New Horizons spacecraft which he worked on. It is scheduled to be turned on as it approaches Pluto and he is worried that it will not operate. The spacecraft could have been hit by space ice, which could have destroyed it. He can't even bear to watch the movie \"Frozen\" anymore.Back in apartment 4A. First they talk about seeing the Philharmonic which has a Beethoven concert. Amy always goes along with Penny which Leonard finds interesting since they want the guys to follow her ideas (also, the guys are accused of controlling their activities, while Penny hypocritically does the same thing to Amy). Sheldon then suggests that they go back to the basics and go clothes shopping while the guys sit in uncomfortable chairs holding their purses. Both of them would hate that. Finally they decide on shopping, Penny's favorite past-time.Raj is getting more nervous as it is still over two hours to go. Raj then decides that if he makes a basket shot into the waste can he can assume that the space probe will operate. After he makes his shot, Howard tells him to settle down; however, he HAS to try the best two out of three shots.Sheldon and Leonard are sitting outside the dressing rooms. Sheldon is uncomfortable staring at all the panties in the lingerie section. There is also no cell phone service in the store.

Now he wants to complain to their corporate office that they have no Wi-Fi, but he can't call him either. Son of a biscuit!\nSheldon surprises Leonard when he says that he makes compromises for him all the time. He didn't mention the lettuce that was stuck in his tooth at lunch even though others were laughing at him. Leonard explains that he drives Sheldon everywhere because he won't learn how to drive. Amy has taught Sheldon to drive, but he finds it scary and doesn't want to take away what he thinks is Leonard's purpose in life.Howard and Raj go out for a drive to calm Raj down. He wants to go to a temple. Howard is worried that they might rip his heart out like in \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\". Even though the imperialistic movie makes the Hindu religion seem like barbarians, Raj still loves that film. Raj admits that religion is a sensitive subject for him, and that he does go to temple whenever necessary. Even though he's a scientist, Raj still has reasons for having a religion, just like Blaise Pascal, Michael Faraday, and Albert Einstein did (Howard only thinks that Einstein believed in God after having coitus with Marilyn Monroe).Penny and Amy are trying on clothes. She asks Amy why she does everything Penny wants. Amy replied that if she got friends, she would do exactly as they asked. Penny says that was then and now she is a woman who is smart, has great friends, a boyfriend, but zero fashion sense as Amy exits the changing stall. Penny agrees to do what Amy wants to do and that's basket weaving at the Crafts Festival Museum.Leonard and Sheldon are still talking about compromises. Sheldon put the apple pancake mix out of alphabetical order on a lower shelf so Leonard could reach it and make Sheldon his breakfast. Leonard compromises because he can't adjust the temperature in his own home, he can't whistle, he can't wear squeaky shoes, and he hasn't moved in with Penny because the last time he mentioned it, Sheldon ran away. Leonard explains that Sheldon has no idea how much he inconveniences the lives of everybody around him due to his behavior, which is exhausting. Sheldon feels that Leonard is mean to him due to his sarcastic comments and eye-rolls. Then Sheldon tells him that if he wants to move out and live with Penny, he should. Leonard doesn't want him to get upset; however, both start to cry over losing their roommate and best friend. They agree that he should do it in stages and the two nights a week at Penny's apartment gets reduced to once a week and Leonard can whistle in the apartment when Sheldon is not there.Howard and Raj arrive at a Hindu temple and Raj starts to describe the architecture. Howard is worried that he is dressed right. Raj always feels that when entering the temple, everything is going to be all right since we are all part of the same cosmos and are all interconnected. His philosophizing stops when someone hits his car with their car door. He starts yelling at the older Indian man who did it. In the middle of this outburst, Howard gets a message and tells Raj that the probe is working fine. Raj calms down. He becomes a suddenly benevolent and respectful Hindu and gives Grandpa a folded hand Namaste! bow.Shamy and Lenny are making baskets at the Crafts Festival Museum and Leonard doesn't find it boring. Penny tells Leonard not to let Amy know or they'll be there every Sunday. Sheldon is not making a basket; he's making a 16th-century Chinese warrior hat.

Leonard had a camera shoved up his nose and was diagnosed with surgery because he has a deviated septum. Sheldon doesn't want Leonard to have the surgery. Amy points out that he always complains about his snoring. The noise helps Sheldon sleep. End of the story, Leonard is going through it.That night Sheldon is watching Leonard snore in bed when Leonard suddenly wakes up. He admits that the snoring helps him sleep. That which is bothering Sheldon is if the surgery is successful, his snoring is gone. Or if he dies in surgery, the snoring is gone. One in seven hundred thousand people die during surgery from anesthesia. Leonard says that it worked out for the other 699,999.Raj is having dinner with Howard and Bernadette at their apartment and is fretting over finding a gift for his parents' fortieth wedding anniversary. He thinks about making them a gift like the drink coasters with a picture of his face he gave Howard and Bernadette.The next day, Leonard arrives home and finds Sheldon is at his whiteboard. Sheldon has been considering everything that could possibly go wrong with Leonard's surgery and has the odds down to one in three hundred. His factors include an allergic reaction to latex gloves, the surgeon might have an epileptic seizure, driving to the hospital, falling down the apartment stairs and an asteroid hitting the earth. Leonard appreciates his concern, but assures him that he is not going to die.Howard shows up at Raj's apartment to hang out and Raj is on the phone with his father. Raj has learned that his parents have split up. Raj breaks down saying that now he comes from a broken home.Leonard and Penny are in the hospital waiting room filling out paperwork. Leonard tells Penny that he told Sheldon they were going Human swimming in the public swimming pool.Sheldon is eating in Amy's car figuring out how much urine would be in the water of a public pool. And he is eating French toast sticks getting Amy's dashboard sticky. He wonders how he could go since he doesn't have his swimming t-shirt which was destroyed last year when they cut him out of it after getting sunburned. After pestering her, she admits that Leonard got an earlier date for surgery and was having it that morning. Sheldon then insists that Amy take him to the hospital.Amy and Sheldon find Penny is in the waiting room who looks uncomfortable after seeing them. Penny complains to Amy that she had to tell him, but she was distracted because he wore extra baby powder. Leonard is still in the operating room. She pats his hand and finds it still sticky from the syrup.Bernadette and Howard come by Raj's office to bring him some muffins. Bernadette keeps making muffin jokes and Howard tells her that they're not that funny. Raj is feeling better and admits the news was harder on him than he thought. Bernadette understands as she would be devastated if her parents split up. Howard says that her father barely speaks to her mother. Bernadette says at least her father stuck around unlike his.Back in the waiting room, Penny mentions the teddy bear and balloon that Sheldon brought him. It's not for Leonard. Amy got it for Sheldon since he stubbed his toe in a revolving door on the way in the hospital when he kept going around and around (he got distracted by the lobby's plant). Penny also asks him to not give Leonard a hard time when he is done since he will not be feeling good. Sheldon promises nothing since Leonard took unnecessary risks and deceived him. Penny cares because she is going to spend the rest of her life with him. \"And I'm not?\" shouts Sheldon as he disturbs Penny. Then the waiting room shakes due to an earthquake tremor which startles Sheldon. He wonders if that could turn a deviated septum into a lobotomy. Then when the lights go out, Sheldon gets up quickly and heads for the operating room running into the glass on the door.Howard and Bernadette are in their apartment sitting at the table talking more about marriage. She doesn't want things to remain bottled up like with Raj's parents and wonders if there is something about her that bothers him. First he thinks he is in a trap and then he tells Bernadette that she is just too beautiful at times. Instead as in Howard's therapy class, they start telling each other what they like. It starts out find and then it degenerates into what they don't like, but in eerie positive statements.Back in the apartment Sheldon and Leonard are in their robes on the couch both with bandages on their nose. Penny is taking their picture for this year's Christmas card. It was revealed that despite the earthquake and minor power outage, the surgery still went through without any trouble. Sheldon still lists all the post-operative problems that could plague Leonard. Penny says that Sheldon is never going to leave Leonard, though Amy insists that he will move out eventually. Leonard is teasing Sheldon telling him nasally \"You Wuv me.\"Raj walks in on them having a round-about argument and says that his mom has already started dating someone. She was probably doing that while she was married. She also has bought the book \"Eat, Pray, Love\" and also set his father's car on fire. Howard mentions that they were telling themselves about all the things they love about each other. Raj remembers that they had done that together at couples therapy which shocks Bernadette.Finally, after both guys have recovered a bit Sheldon is unpacking the urn he bought for Leonard, in case the worst happened. Penny wants him to send it back; however, Sheldon got it engraved, making that not possible. \"Here lie the ashes of Leonard Hofstadter. He thought he was right, but his roommate knew better.\" He also got one for himself which said \"I'm with stupid.\"Title reference: Leonard has deviated septum surgery against Sheldon's wishes.", "episode_2": "While having dinner, Sheldon is describing a World War II project where Soviet Union Premier Joseph Stalin wanted to have human women impregnated by gorillas to produce super soldiers. Leonard suggested hippos would make pretty bad-ass soldiers. Howard counters that when they are hungry-hungry, they could be stopped by marbles. Sheldon says a Koala army would be so cute that it couldn't be attacked.\nPenny's job starts next Monday and Bernadette is pushing Penny to finish studying the background material she has. Penny feels that they will teach her everything she needs to know; however, Bernadette just feels that they would be impressed if she was already familiar with the material.Sheldon has a meeting with Janine Davis (Regina King) of Human Resources. Sheldon assumes that she wants to reopen their dialogue on him changing his field of study: Janine says that while he was away, the university worked on his problem and came up with a solution. His current grant is for researching string theory; however, promoting him to junior professor he can work on anything he chooses though he will have to teach a class. Sheldon describes their solution as giving him a promotion and paying him more money so he can impart his knowledge to the next generation.Amy is back to working with starfish when Penny comes over to have lunch with her. She is stimulating the pleasure centers of the starfish. Penny didn't invite Bernadette to join them since is constantly bugging her to study. Amy figures that Bernadette thinks that she wants her to do well since she might not due to her poor performance as a waitress. Amy says that sharing negative feelings can be a powerful bonding force between two friends. In the spirit of science she asks: What is that little bad person's problem?\"In the cafeteria, Raj is trying to come up with a cute couple's nickname for him and Emily, like \"Emipali\" or \"Koothremily\". Her last name is Sweeney and Raj doesn't like \"Koothrapeeny\". Sheldon shows up and describes the awful situation with his new promotion. He doesn't want to babysit a bunch of grad students who think that dark matter is what is in their diapers. Leonard tells him that it is a way to let him go on and study dark matter. Sheldon has had many heroes who took people under their wings. Richard Feynman. Albert Einstein. Professor Xavier. Some of Doctor X's students really had wings, Sheldon notes and was the only one laughing. He plans to use that joke in his class after everyone fails the midterm.Amy is continuing her pleasure center research with her starfish (You like that, don't you?), when Bernadette Skypes in. She invites Amy out for a drink without Penny since she is frustrated with her. Amy asks if she is mad because Penny isn't trying hard enough. Also, via Instagram, Bernadette saw that Penny went out to lunch and got a manicure. Amy adds that it's like Penny doesn't even care and that Amy is there for Bernadette, now playing both sides of their fight.Leonard, Raj and Howard find Sheldon in his empty classroom. No one signed up because Sheldon has a reputation for being obnoxious. Now Sheldon can devote all his time to the study of dark matter. Howard volunteers to take his class since he wants to start work on his doctorate. Sheldon thanks Howard, but doesn't think he would understand anything about it since it was a graduate level class. Howard insists that he is more than smart enough; he is an engineer. Sheldon throws three physics questions at him that he answers correctly.Walking up the stairs Amy tells about Penny calling her to complain about Bernadette and then she gets a text from Bernie. Sheldon is trying to prepare his lesson plans for Howard. Amy loves being in the center and now feels like she is the popular girl. Sheldon wants to figure out how to intellectually emasculate Howard.Late at night, Leonard comes in finding Sheldon creating a lesson plan that will make Howard feel lost. Leonard can't understand why Sheldon has to prove that he is smarter than Howard. Sheldon finds that a pleasure that, that is his job as a teacher.Howard comes into Sheldon's classroom and tells him that Leonard warned him that he is going to make the course very hard, in order to belittle him. Should Sheldon make an effect to be a good teacher, Howard would give the class a shot. Sheldon agrees, then jumps on him when he finds something he doesn't know. Howard plugs in his iPod to ignore him. Since Sheldon is a bad teacher, Howard plans to be a crappy student. Then Howard makes a spit ball shooter and propels one into Sheldon's mouth. The ball goes down his throat and Sheldon flees in fear.Amy is enjoying being in the middle of Bernadette and Penny calling up Penny to go out and bad mouth Bernadette. Penny is now studying to do well. Amy then calls up Bernadette to go out. Bernadette is planning on helping Penny study and thinks that they are being too hard on Penny. Everything is now good between Penny and Bernadette. Then she calls Sheldon who is trying to deal with the spit ball in his mouth.In the apartment, Leonard is looking down Sheldon's throat. Leonard assures him that his uvula doesn't have an STD. Howard goes back to confront Sheldon after Sheldon reported him to Human Resources; Wolowitz says that he dropped the course. Howard tells Sheldon that just because he asks him things he doesn't know, that doesn't make him smarter. Howard could do the same thing to him with questions about engineering. Sheldon answers the first two questions from Howard but when he gets to the third one is left speechless as he doesn't know the answer. Howard proceeds to taunt Sheldon at his lack of knowledge on engineering. At this point, Sheldon finally coughs up the spitball from his mouth.Bernadette goes to help Penny and finds that she understands the background material she was given. Since they are done, she decides to call Amy since she really wanted to go out. She is listening behind the door and runs down the stairs to take the call.Finally, the guys keep asking each other scientific questions, feeling proud that they are so smart, but lamenting that they still didn't get girls in high school. They were awkward, weird and couldn't play sports.

He works on it all night and keeps repeating the words \"Proton Decay\" over and over while wearing his noise canceling headphones.The next day Leonard finds Sheldon in his spot wearing his pajamas. Sheldon is not going to work cause he spent all night working on proton decay and he accomplished nothing and is wondering if he made a mistake deciding to study dark matter. Sheldon thinks that he has been in the apartment too long and needs some fresh air. He steps into the hallway and takes a deep breath. He hears groaning coming from Penny's apartment, does his knock and then enters without an Invitation. Penny is exercising doing a strenuous routine she hates which makes her work harder at it. He asks her to guess why he is staying home. She says that he spent all night working and he accomplished nothing so he is going to stay home to pout about it.Leonard, Raj and Howard are eating at the cafeteria. Howard says he has invented a new game: Emily or Cinnamon. Players have to guess whether quotes that Howard has heard Raj say are about his girlfriend Emily or his dog Cinnamon.

To check his problem solving rate, Amy starts to make noises rubbing the outside of a balloon. Sheldon gets annoyed and pops the balloon. She needs to irritate him to find his optimal anxiety zone. Sheldon vetoed tickling, polka music and watching Amy eat a banana. She eats it sideways because \"that's the way a good girl does it\", according to her mother. Amy explains that he is a great scientist who needs to be patient until he makes his scientific breakthrough. Also if he only does solid research, what does it matter? Sheldon feels that she is insulting him which drives his anxiety level up. This result makes him happy which drives the level down. Frustrated, his level goes up again starting an anxiety cycle that he continues.In apartment 4A. Howard wants to play Emily or Cinnamon. First quote: You're so lucky. You have the shiniest hair.

Amy would rather visit the Mauna Kea observatory. Sheldon joins them and wants to increase his anxiety level by spending an evening listening to tasteless uncensored crotch talk.

Sheldon claims that Isaac Newton worked while thinking that he was an armadillo. Amy says that that is not true, though Sheldon claims that has been hallucinating lately. Amy then demands that he take off the cap. Sheldon stops and then asks what she is going to do if he doesn't. Amy kicks him out of her apartment. On the bus ride back, Sheldon hallucinates that the man sitting next to him (whom he is talking to) is an armadillo named Isaac Newton, who surprisingly understands why Sheldon was so frustrated with Amy.Finally Penny and Leonard walk Sheldon to his bedroom though he doesn't see the \"President of Science\". They get him to lie down in bed though Sheldon tells them that he is not going to sleep. Penny starts to sing Soft Kitty to him and Leonard joins in. He finally goes to sleep.At the Caltech cafeteria, Sheldon has recovered and is making progress without his anxiety workout. Raj and Emily approach the gang to join them for lunch.

To counter this codicil, Sheldon hides behind a happy face mask.While Raj and Bernadette discuss redecorating ideas, the doorbell rings. A young man Josh (Matt Bennett) is there and tells Howard how a lawyer contacted his father, Sam Wolowitz, about the title on that house. Since Sam was Howard's father, that makes the young man, Howard's half-brother. Howard calls and tells Bernadette that weird things were happening.Penny is answering a question that she first knew it was a bad movie when she read the title: \"Serial Apeist 2: Monkey See, Monkey Kill\".

After a poor high school experience, he gets to return as a successful scientist with a beautiful girl on his arm and, per Sheldon, a pointy hat sticking out of his eyeball.As Penny and Leonard head down the stairs, Penny explains how she packed so fast. One spring break she took nothing, but a long T-shirt and a belt (the belt being used for \"an evening look\"). As Leonard is knocking on New Jersey, he gets a text message that their airline flight has been canceled due to bad weather. To lighten the mood, Penny suggests that he give the speech to her (giving him the thought of her as a high school cheerleader fascinated with esteemed alumni).Howard and Sheldon are trying to get the helicopter video system to work.

The gown is from a costume store and is very short since it is a \"sexy graduate\" costume.The helicopter is completely disassembled on the kitchen counter. Howard doesn't seem completely sure what all the parts do, but he still flaunts his education. Sheldon reminds him of the space toilet he built for the space station that didn't work. Howard counters that the toilet wasn't designed for the Russian cosmonaut's potato based diet. Raj shows up and freaks out that he took it apart. Raj wants to return the helicopter due to his father's actions. After Howard gets him to calm down, Raj decides to take responsibility for his life and calls his mother (Alice Amter).

Penny offers to take him someplace nice if he'll put on a belt like her own Spring break outfit.Howard had narrowed down the problem to a faulty pin on a computer chip. Sheldon is impressed and asks him if he could fix a toy locomotive that no longer puffs smoke. Bernadette shows up with the tool that Howard asked for. Raj plans on just buying a new helicopter; however, Howard, as an engineer, wants to fix the problem anyway. Bernadette suggests that they call tech support. The geniuses balk at that suggestion since they laugh at people who call those folks, proceeding to do so with Bernadette, who does call them.At Leonard's old high school, he is introduced as a distinguished alumnus, the noted Caltech physicist, Doctor Leonard Hofstadter. Leonard remembers that last time he was in that auditorium, the lacrosse team played with his asthma inhaler. He thanks his beautiful fiance for setting up the broadcast and then surprises Penny by showing her on video. She says \"hi\" and for everyone to stay in school and stay off drugs, even though they are currently graduating.The helicopter now has a working power supply, WiFi, GPS, and a charged battery. Preparing for takeoff as the helicopter lets out a puff of smoke just like Sheldon's locomotive used to. Howard concedes to Bernadette to call tech support.

He wants to know what he talked to his mother about. Raj claims that she has a lot of imagination and that it's good he took after his father. Dr. K was Raj's role model and that is what got him into science so he claims. Then Raj charges into the apartment asking who wants to fly to Vegas on a real helicopter.Continuing his speech about knowledge, Leonard changes the subject to that they are probably as bored with the speech as he is or Penny. Reflecting on how he didn't feel like he existed, he then speaks to the smart and invisible students currently at the high school. With all that time they are spending alone, they are just becoming interesting and people out in the world find them a lot cooler than they thought. For the popular kids, their popularity is now over.The guys are still waiting to have a tech rep get on line. Howard muses that he has become an old man now baffled by modern technology.

Tech support answers and an anxious Sheldon tells him that there's a robot uprising and he should call the police.\nIn the last scene, the helicopter is still flying all over and attacks Leonard and Penny in the hallway.Title reference: Leonard's speech being transmitted over Skype.", "episode_14": "While Leonard and Penny are eating dinner together, Penny asks about his on-going work with a particle detector and super-fluids. The super-cooled helium has a habit of crawling up the insides of the container and spilling out all over the place. Leonard then starts to talk about super-fluid vacuum theory for a moment and then stops. If one images three-dimensional-space on the surface of a n-dimension bubble wonders Leonard. He gets excited and he runs off to discuss it with Sheldon. After describing his theory, Sheldon considers it rather noisily. Sheldon replies that it is good and he likes it. Sheldon gives Leonard a sticker with a kitty on it saying \"Me-WOW\".Later that night, Leonard wakes up and finds Sheldon has finished the calculations on his theory and written a research paper. First, Leonard wonders why Sheldon wrote a paper about his idea. Leonard looks over his work and thinks the paper is good. Their concept is revolutionary and he wonders if anyone else has considered it. The only way to know is to post it on-line. Leonard thinks they should sent it out and the two of them both click the computer mouse to sent it out to the world.The girls are getting together for movie night. Amy and Bernadette want to watch Penny's gorilla movie. Penny doesn't, but they do find it online and start to watch it. The movie starts with a guy selling fresh bananas after which Bernadette knows this movie is going to be a train wreck.In Leonard's lab he is continuing his work with super-cooled helium. Raj and Howard enter with some great news; their paper was mentioned on the Quantum Diaries physics blog. There is a paper summary and they are is getting a lot of positive comments. \"Insightful and innovating.\" \"The concept shows some real out-of-the-box thinking.\" One person named \"GeneralRelativity\", comments that he wished this blog would devote itself to real science and not wanna theoreticians who are in a rush to publish. He has a theory that space-time is like two clowns with their heads in a bucket like Cooper and Hofstadter. Sheldon responds to the message.Penny is suffering through watching her movie until she finally turns it off. Her character knows that she is a killer gorilla because she just bit off the fingers of the doctor's receptionist. Penny then digs up a video of Bernadette in a beauty pageant. Bernie snaps back that she just came to the revelation that making fun of people is wrong. Amy, wanting to watch the video, tells Penny to play it, which she proceeds to do. An adorable little Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski is campaigning for Miss California Quiznos in 1999. In her video she says that she really, really \"wanna\" to win it several times per the Spice Girls song. Bernadette is horrified.In the apartment, they have not found any more comments from \"GeneralRelativity\". Sheldon's responses stated that they are both professionals and not crack-pots or wanna-be and that they stand behind their paper and, later that night, his mother.Bernadette is embarrassed about her beauty pageant past in which Penny agrees. Then, she blurts out that Amy writes \"Little House on the Prairie\" fan fiction that includes herself and Sheldon, and posts it online. Amy wants to know what she did to deserve that. Bernadette replies that she had to get the attention off of her, and that tearing down other women was part of her pageant training. Penny concludes that it's about her and Sheldon. That is not true. Her story is about a physicist named Cooper time travelling back in time and meeting a pioneer woman named Amelia. Penny quickly finds it and starts to read as Bernadette listens carefully.Raj is creating some fake accounts to add positive comments about their paper. Finally the troll responds that Sheldon and Leonard's juvenile attempts at humor go to prove that the physicists at Caltech are nothing but a bunch of engineers which really insults Sheldon and Howard. Sheldon challenges the troll to meet them face to face. He gets an Internet video call. Sheldon freaks out and slams his computer shut, thus not taking the call.Penny and Bernadette are having a great time reading Amy's story. Sheldon is found to be exhausting even in her fantasies, comments Bernadette. Amy says that then she changes him because that is good writing. And wishful thinking. They get excited reading about how Amelia is reacting to the man from the future named Cooper as they start to flirt.Back in the apartment the guys discuss how these trolls feel that the anonymity of the Internet allows them to say what they wouldn't say in front of their face. Sheldon remarks that he can't think of a thing that he wouldn't say in front of somebody. They decide to confront this troll. Returning the call and Sheldon and Leonard find out that it was Professor Hawking. When asked if he didn't like their paper, he admits that he did find it intriguing and after forty years in a wheelchair, one gets bored. Leonard and Sheldon are so glad Hawking likes their work, and even Howard has to admit it's pretty cool.Still reading Amy's story, Amelia is helping Cooper fix his time machine. Amy stops them after they seem to be making fun of her; however, Bernadette and Penny have gotten so invested in the story that they want to hear more of it. Amy agrees and starts to read how Amelia wants him to stay, but he still has to depart. He disappears. Amelia starts to cry as a hand reaches for her shoulder. Cooper has returned. Amelia asks \"What about the future?\" He admits that there is no future without her. As Amelia starts to feel excited, Leonard runs in with his exciting news that Professor Hawking liked their paper. Penny and Bernie shout at him, \"GET OUT!\"Finally, Cooper and Amelia (Sheldon and Amy) are seen with Cooper being bathed by Amelia. He thanks her for his warm bath and tells her all about his Underoos. Leonard tells her to keep reading the story while they are in bed.

A pipe broke over her clothes closet destroying all her clothes and her apartment will be uninhabitable for five weeks. Penny suggests that she stay in Leonard's bedroom while the Hofstadters stay across the hall. Technically Amy would be moving in with her boyfriend while Penny gets to live \"alone\" with her husband.While setting up dinner, Sheldon comments that cohabitation is a lot to process. Penny reminds him that it is only for five weeks and that they'll be right across the hall. Amy proposes it to him as a scientist to collect data about their compatibility. Like Star Trek, Leonard compares it to Sheldon's own five-week mission. Now that is what Sheldon considers as sexy talk. Next Sheldon is worried that he might find it being comfortable with Amy because he was in a familiar environment. They need a neutral ground. Penny tells them to move in across the hall. Finally Sheldon accepts the five-week mission as Amy grabs and hugs him happily.Howard, Bernadette and Raj enter the kitchen as Raj tells them how happy he is with their OB/GYN. Howard complains that he doesn't have to come to every appointment. Bernadette does not like him describing her textbook cervix.

They say their final farewells and then Sheldon and Amy are in the apartment alone officially living together. Sheldon declares that the experiment has begun. Penny and Leonard can be heard yelling, \"WE DID IT!\"Later, while Amy is unpacking, Sheldon wonders which side of the bed she wants. They argue about who should pick and Amy insists that Sheldon do it. The left is closer to the door for exit in case of emergency, but is closer to the entrance in case of attack. The other side is closer to the window, but perverts could be watching him while he slept. Amy then closed the drapes as a solution. That solves the problem until Sheldon wonders about someone standing behind the drapes.Howard is coming to bed while Bernadette remarks that it is ridiculous that everyone else knows the sex of the baby including the doctor, the sonogram technician, and Raj.Amy is getting ready for bed, making noises from the bathroom. Sheldon makes a sour face from those noises and then moves over to the side of the bed away from the bathroom. Amy notices his move and Sheldon remarks that she should be glad he was still in the room. Sheldon wants to build a wall of pillows between them. Amy shoots his idea down. Sheldon says that he is very sensitive to heat and that her bottom should have iguanas lying next to it.Over to Apartment 4A, Leonard looks at his wristwatch declaring that it is Sheldon's bedtime and he is in for the night. Penny is ecstatic to have the apartment all to themselves and asks what he wants to do and he takes his jacket off.

Raj is asleep with Cinnamon and picks up the phone just as Howard hangs up.Penny eventually caved in and is seen dancing with Leonard.\nSheldon is now snoring and Amy can't get any sleep.\nNext Penny is comforting Leonard who exerted himself from doing the worm and is now on his asthma inhaler.\nRaj gets another call and hears Bernadette shouting to hang up.Amy is now spooning with Sheldon looking very happy.

Penny smiles at her and tells her \"Yeah, get it, girl\". Amy says that it's not what she thinks. Leonard joins them complaining that he pulled something. Penny quips that it's really not what Amy thinks. Sheldon enters (without knocking) telling them about his good night's sleep. Amy exclaims that she was on the floor all night and that maybe living together was a bad idea. Sheldon argues that she is a scientist and should stick with the experiment.

Bert tells them that he's going to start cleaning up. Bert asks Amy not to spread rumors about the bust of a party since she is the coolest girl on campus, a fact that surprises both of them.

At Leonard's request he agrees to pull it together, but then starts getting physical tics and twitches from his caffeine withdrawal.Having tea in the kitchen, Bernadette apologizes for lashing out at Raj and blames it on hormones.

Then she yells back at him that she is clearly upset and that he should follow her.Bert is visiting with Penny and Amy and tells a story that when Amy developed a laboratory cleaning solution, everybody started using it.

Raj introduces Bernadette, who his father is happy to talk to. Dr. K listens and then explains that some people are or aren't baby people. That doesn't mean that she won't love her own baby. Mrs. K was excited about being pregnant with Raj, doted on him constantly and then he broke her heart by moving away and dating poor white women. Bernadette thanks him and feels better.

Penny wants to know what the real story is. Sheldon begins a story that he has told no one. When he was 13, on a break from college (They ran out of math that they could teach him.), Sheldon returned home and found his father in his parents' bedroom having relations with another woman. That is why he knocks three times. The first is traditional and the other two get one time to get their pants on.

Sheldon then offers a toast to Stuart as a fine friend and good guest.Leonard is now holding court before five fans on how an asthmatic nerd landed the hot fox.

Of course, he also thinks that Leonard has done nothing so he shouldn't be jealous of others, which unsurprisingly angers Leonard beyond belief. Sheldon is still angry that someone that studies rocks would better him. He picks up a rock to metaphorically throw away his anger.Next, Leonard is helping Sheldon back into Apartment 4A as Sheldon complains about his feet. He threw the rock down hitting his foot and then got even angrier and kicked another rock with his other foot.

Leonard leaves to help him and take some pictures.Sheldon explains to Amy that he tried to punch a water fountain, slipped on the wet floor and then his head hit the water fountain (she initially thought he headbutted the fountain).

Raj says that he is jealous of the happy relationships his married friends are in, but isn't too impressed with Amy and Sheldon. Leonard is jealous of how wealthy Raj's family is, something Raj loves to hear. Amy is jealous of how beautiful Penny is. Then she was happy that she cut her hair. Why?

Though he has been on \"The Simpsons\" and \"Star Trek\". He reminds himself that every scientific advancement is a victory. Sheldon should not waste his time on jealousy since he is so brilliant. It would be easy to replace him with the sitting statue of Abraham Lincoln in the Lincoln Memorial. Hawking wishes that there was a little motorized version of him, an idea that Sheldon supports.

Now everyone is complaining about who they have to stay with as Sheldon tries to diagram where who should be in which apartment.Back in 4B, Wyatt asks his daughter about the world of pharmaceuticals. Susan doesn't want any more drug talk for the rest of their trip. Wyatt wants another beer while Susan thinks that he has had enough. Susan says that she can see why Randall turned up in jail. Leonard and Beverly enter the apartment and Susan is very glad to see him again and hugs him.Back to 4A: Alfred tells Amy that he is sorry because of all the trouble he has caused. Amy is happy that Alfred and Mary like each other. Alfred reaches for Amy's hand and says, \"You are a patient young woman.\" Sheldon growls and tells him to take a cold shower \"Grandpa\". She's mine!Howard is still worried about what the Colonel wants and figures that it is bad news. They could do away with the invention and Howard is left with nothing. Raj tells a story about the scientists on the Manhattan Project who got nothing from it.At Penny's, Beverly asks Randall what he does for a living. Susan steps in when he is between jobs. Randall adds that he is also between court appearances. Wyatt is happy to meet the woman who raised Leonard, this fine young man. Susan tells Wyatt that he doesn't need another beer. Penny comes in hoping that everyone is getting to know each other.The wedding ceremony:In a park setting backed-up with trellises, the guests are seated while Bernadette stands in front to officiate with Leonard. Amy has her harp. Stuart walks in and sits in the empty seat between Leonard's parents.\nPenny is escorted up the aisle by a very proud father. Wyatt welcomes Leonard to the family and advises him to not loan his brother-in-law any money. Bernie speaks that they are there to celebrate love. Not just the love between the bride and groom, but also for the love they have for them and between each other. Love is patient and doesn't put up with all the side-chatter coming from the audience's comments. Standing in front of all their family and friends brings up a lot of feelings in her, like eloping the first time was a good thing. Leonard has also made her very happy and she thanks him for marrying him.\nLeonard describes how as a scientist he has to explain why things happen and he can explain why someone like him ended up with someone like her. He doesn't have to understand it, just be grateful because he loves her. Alfred stands up and says to everyone even though he and Beverly don't bring out the best in each other, the best thing to come out of their relationship was Leonard.\nBefore they can go on, Sheldon stands up and says he has to say something to a person who is pretty special. Amy starts to stand up and says, \"It's happening!\" thinking that she was getting a proposal. Sheldon then says \"Leonard\". Sheldon tells Leonard that he has always considered him family. Leonard and Penny thank him.Leonard drives both his parents to the airport. They seem to be getting along until they start arguing about Leonard getting into the carpool lane. Amy is driving Mary to the airport with Sheldon in the back seat. Penny is driving her folks and brother to the airport. Her mother doesn't know what she was worried about since Penny's friends are just lovely. She does find Sheldon a bit peculiar. He reminds her father of a turkey they had that drowned looking up at the rain. Everybody has a laugh until Randall sees some cops and hides.Title reference: Everyone assuming Mary and Alfred slept together.", "episode_2": "In apartment 4A, Leonard and Sheldon are at their computers. Sheldon discovers that Elon Musk has a theory that everyone is all characters in some advanced civilization's video game. Leonard wonders if some alien kind got him the upgrade for an inhaler and eye-glasses. Howard and Raj are complaining that there is a problem since the military visited Howard and wants to have a meeting about their gyroscope. Leonard adds that if the research is declared classified, the government could take it away from them and end their \"big payday. Sheldon says that All of them could become faceless cogs in the military-industrial complex AND he finds that exciting. Howard objects that they could be working on a weapon system that could oppress mankind for the next millennium. Sheldon feels that Howard is then on board and asks Leonard if he is too.In apartment 4B, Penny's Posse is having wine while Bernadette (apple juice) says that she is worried about Howard being a nervous wreck since talking to the military. Bernie gets a text from work from somebody congratulating her on her pregnancy. She hadn't told anyone at work. Penny denied having spread the story. Bernadette figures that it was Barbara Chen from Retrovirus who heard her throwing up in the bathroom. If the company knows that she is pregnant, she could lose a big ImmunoTherapy project. She did the same thing to Barbara Chen last year when Bernadette learned that she was pregnant.Returning to 4A, the guys stop Raj from putting on Snapchat the fact that they are working on a secret government project. They wonder if they should talk to a lawyer. Sheldon says they don't need a lawyer, they have him.Back discussing Bernadette's pregnancy, she said that she was going to hide it by leaving Dove Bar wrappers all over the place to explain her weight gain. Bernadette leaves to find out if her boss knows. Penny gives her a loving send-off and then tells Amy that she was the one that accidentally let her fellow employees know. Penny feels bad that she lied to her.In Howard's lab, the guys are setting up a video chat with Howard's lawyer cousin, Marty (Josh Zuckerman). Sheldon wonders how a tax lawyer from Fort Lauderdale could give them advice on intellectual properties. Sheldon thinks it's pointless as Howard's cousin doesn't do this kind of law and lives in Boca Raton. Cousin Marty is peeved that Howard went into space, so whatever he accomplishes, his mother will be disappointed in him, though Howard points out that they're even because he married a Catholic woman. Marty claims to not know much about patent law. Marty's advice is to listen to them, tell them as little as possible and not to sign anything.In Bernadette's office, Penny comes by because she was attending a seminar on a sleeping pill which put her to sleep. Bernadette still doesn't know who told them about her pregnancy and is furious. Penny reluctantly confesses, tells her that it was an accident, and is very sorry that she lied about it. A shocked Bernadette just tells her to get out. Penny sadly leaves.The guys are waiting in Howard's lab to meet with Colonel Williams (Dean Norris). Sheldon is not allowed to say anything since his comments enrage people. Can he exchange pleasantries with him? Yes. Can Sheldon inform him that Colonel Sanders was not in the military? Leonard is now enraged. Colonel Williams enters. He asks who the main brain behind it, Howard humbly takes that credit. Sheldon says nothing, but is very upset.Later, Howard and Leonard are explaining the gyroscope to the Colonel who understands it, because he is an engineer (Sheldon gasps) who went to M.I.T. (Another gasp.) The Air Force has an application for their invention and wants to fund it. They are happy, but are worried that it might be used for weapons. The Colonel says whatever they use it for is none of their business. He tells them that it's just a guidance system and not like they are handing him the Death Star from Star Trek. Sheldon goes silently ballistic over this inaccuracy. He does need them to reduce the size down to a cantaloupe. The Colonel says that some people at M.I.T think they can do it in four months. Sheldon finally explodes stating that they can do it in two months. After he introduces himself and adds that engineers aren't real scientists, M.I.T. is a trade school and the Death Star is from Star Wars. And he thanked him for his service in the military giving him a salute.Bernadette is in her office working late, so Amy brought her dinner. Amy wonders if she is worried that people will start treating her differently. Bernadette exclaims that she has always been treated differently because of how she sounds and looks. Bernadette complains that it took her time to get where she was and doesn't want to start over just because she is pregnant. Amy wants to help her. Calming down, Bernadette was pleased that at least she brought her French fries. Apple slices, because she was pregnant. Bernadette then snaps asking what lunatic goes to McDonald's and brings back fruit. Amy quickly exits to retrieve fries while Bernadette also demands a chocolate shake.Penny enters her home while Sheldon is making Leonard lemon bars. Sheldon is mad at Leonard so he's making something that Leonard doesn't like. They have a ridiculously short time frame to finish the project thanks to Sheldon. After Sheldon asks, Penny told him that she let Bernadette's pregnancy slip at work and now she feels terrible. The exact same thing happened to Sheldon except that he told it on purpose and has no regrets.Now in Howard's much emptier lab, the guys are boxing up his project. Howard figures they will have to work 24/7 to meet the two-month deadline. Raj is sad that he won't see them much. They are off with the military and he knows how those Army wives feel.Bernadette walks up to apartment 4B, and Penny lets her in awkwardly. She apologizes to Penny because she knows that it was an accident. As to the project, Bernadette reminded him that she was a sweet little pregnant woman who wasn't afraid to cry in front of a jury. Penny asked if she was going to sue. Bernadette replied that when you're four foot eleven and looking in every guy's crotch, you know where to hit him.Sheldon, Leonard and Howard are walking down a hallway inspecting the university's building where classified work is done. They reach the door of their new lab and discover that the door has a retinal scanner on it. Howard and Leonard try it out. An hour later they are still playing with it.Title reference: The military wanting a smaller version of the guidance system.", "episode_8": "Sheldon's sitting in Amy's lab lamenting how much the skin tissue sample she is about to take from him is going to hurt. Amy wants to synthesize a neural network using their joint skin cells. Sheldon is willing to do it for science though the alcohol swap is very cold. Amy gives him a count of three before he takes it. Three. Two. Swab! Sheldon doesn't even feel it, but does make her say three because of his need for closure.Raj is in the telescope lab eating Funyuns and looking for extraterrestrial planets. Isabella (Maria Canals-Barrera) the maintenance worker comes in. Raj finds a gravitational wobble that could be an extra-solar planet that could have life on it and could be named after him. Isabella wonders if there is life, maybe it already has a name. Raj helps her with the trash and they stare at each other for a moment and then say goodbye.While Amy is checking their brain cells, Sheldon pushes her aside and all he sees is his own eyelashes. Amy then checks and finds AstroCytes which means they have grown a primitive neural network. Sheldon then finds himself with a profound sense of creation since they used his DNA not unlike when he made sea monkeys. Since it was also using Amy's DNA, he redefines their creation as we-monkeys. They then start to test it to light and sound to see how it reacts.The gang is around the table in Apartment 4A. Howard figures the order was screwed up since they got steamed broccoli which was for Raj. Penny is sure that he must be seeing someone since he has switched to broccoli. Finally he admits that he met a woman in the telescope room named Isabella. Leonard figures that she is an astronomer and then Raj doesn't correct him.Bernadette is discussing the DNA experiment at Amy's place (Apartment 4B). She can't believe that one can turn skin cells into functioning brain cells. Amy counters that she turned Sheldon into a functioning boyfriend. According to Bernadette, her baby is now facing down getting ready for birth. She gets uptight when Sheldon compares their growing neural creation with her gestating human child. Sheldon agrees to think of both of them special in their own way, though they didn't have to have sex with Howard to have theirs.Raj is helping Isabella clean the men's room calling it fun. He also mentions that he had a cleaning lady and other servants when he was growing up. Raj finds out that she is unmarried and has a 19-year-old son at UCLA studying law. She appreciates the interest, but she works two jobs and has no time for dating. She tells him \"Good night\", though Raj while leaving says that he still thinks that there is something going on between them.Amy and Sheldon are very happy with their results since their little network is processing more information than most. He wants to go onto step two. Amy says that would be to try to replicate their results again. No. Sheldon wants them to have a baby. Amy asks what he is talking about? Sheldon points out that their DNA combination is truly exceptional and that it might be the next step in mankind's evolution. Amy is not ready to have a baby, even though Sheldon insists that her menstrual cycle is right for it. Sheldon then leans over and starts wiggling his bottom at her. Amy gets disgusted and leaves.Isabella comes into the telescope room and has found that Raj has made them dinner since she was too busy to go out. He even cleaned up the next office so that she could take a break. He claimed that it was food from her homeland. Cuban food? Raj then wonders if they had Mexican food in Cuba.Amy is discussing Sheldon's need for making a baby with Leonard and Penny. Penny wonders if he wanted to make the baby out of Lego. Then Penny asks if they would have a super-intelligent child? That was possible, but not guaranteed. Sheldon's father once picked a fight with a cactus, but that didn't include his extraterrestrial parents that sent him to earth. Reaching the top of the stairs, Amy finds a path of rose petals going into her apartment. \"Oh, man!\" she exclaims. Leonard and Penny have fun with whatever nightmare is behind door number two.\nAmy finds the lights low, candlelight, cool jazz playing and Sheldon dressed up with his hair slicked down drinking brandy from a snifter. Sheldon offers her a brandy and Amy declines. Being himself for once, Sheldon replies that it is just as well since it's disgusting. Amy tells him to stop trying to seduce her and then leaves. Sheldon tells her that he doesn't know how to open the oysters.Raj is now having dinner with Isabella. They are talking about when they first came to America. She mentions that she has some time off on Sunday as Howard comes in. He asks if she was the astronomer that Raj met. Isabella is not happy and leaves because she is not going to waste her time with someone who is embarrassed by her. Raj runs after her to apologize and he tells her embarrassing things about him. Finally she says that he can take her out to a nice place to eat on Sunday night and it can be Pakistani food if he likes. He says he's Indian, to which Isabella says now he knows what it's like to be stereotyped.Amy is talking to the Hofstadters. Penny wonders how much she was turned on. Amy said it felt like being hit on by Rat Pack Pee Wee Herman, meaning she wasn't. Sheldon comes in and starts to flamenco dance to Amy, the world's sexiest dance. Amy calls Sheldon ridiculous and then leaves. Leaning up against the wall outside of 4A, Amy is obviously turned on and exclaims, \"That was a close one.\"Title reference: Sheldon and Amy mix their DNA and incubate some brain cells."}, "season_2": {"episode_16": "The guys play paintball. Raj, Sheldon and Leonard attack the enemy positions while Howard was asked to cover them. Sheldon was unhappy with Howard since he didn't attend Sheldon's paintball strategy meeting since he had to take his mother to the doctor's for her varicose veins\nAs the attack commences, Howard is alone in the shed when Leslie Winkle enters. She claims that she shot her team as they didn't listen to her. They compare paintball to war and proceed to have sex (since they want to live each day as it is their last)Back home from paintball, Penny accidentally shoots several green paint-balls at Sheldon's couch cushion (Sheldon was going out of the apartment for work and asked Penny not to sit in his spot, even though he himself wont be sitting there), and she and Leonard try hard to fix it.\nPenny flips the cushion so Sheldon wont notice, but the butt prints are all wrong and Sheldon figures out .. Penny gives the cushion to the dry cleaner to get the paintball stain out. Sheldon drives everyone crazy by roaming all over the apartment and not finding a satisfying place to sit. Howard even removes the cushion from under Raj and gives it to Sheldon, but Sheldon wont accept it as he needs his own cushion.Penny gets the cushion back from the cleaners and Sheldon still rejects it. To distract Sheldon, Leonard then reveals to Sheldon that the cashew chicken he has been having for the last 2 yrs, thinking it is from Szechuan Palace, is actually from Golden Dragon. As Szechuan Palace closed down 2 yrs ago. Before they went out of business, Leonard bought 4000 Szechuan Palace containers (stored in the trunk of his car) and transferred the food (from Golden Dragon into the Szechuan Palace containers) to make Sheldon think it was coming from his usual place. Sheldon gets so distracted by this bad news that he forgets all about the cushion.Leslie and Howard begin a relationship after having sex (twice) during the match. There are funds cutbacks at the university and everyone's grants are reduced to the bone. But Leslie has access to some unrestricted grant money.\nLeslie secures the funds for Howard's work (and the related required expensive equipment) and even invites him to a trip to the CERN Large Hadron Collider project in Geneva, but threatens to withdraw the invitation unless he accompanies her to a cousins wedding. So sex is just Leslie's way of controlling Howard.\nAlthough initially reluctant, Howard later happily accepts his role as a \"sex toy/arm candy\" after Leslie comforts him. Howard and Leslie had sex at his mother's house and Howard lies to his mother that Leslie is Jewish. Howard has transient idiopathic arrhythmiaSheldon, still upset and dissatisfied with his eventually dry-cleaned cushion, team-kills Penny in the next paintball game (even though she was their only hope). In retaliation, Leonard and Penny shoot Sheldon and Sheldon shoots Leonard..\nThis causes the others to surrender and then go to Denny's for food.Title reference: Sheldon's cushion, which Penny \"saturates\" with paint.", "episode_13": "Sheldon hears that Kripke controls access to an Open Science Grid computer, so he plans to befriend him to gain access to it. Sheldon needs time on the computer and has come to understand that Kripke allows his friends to access itThe socially inept Sheldon struggles (Kripke has no interest in becoming Sheldon's friend), and his current friends are of little help in this area. To understand why his current friends like him, Sheldon has devised a 211 items questionnaire (which takes 3 hrs to complete, along with essay type questions) to figure out why he doesn't have more friends\nLeonard advises him not approach friendship as a science project, like he did when he tried to learn swimming from YouTube, on land.. and rather make friends by spending time with them and getting to know them. Sheldon maintains that the swimming skills he learned on land are transferable to water and that he has no interest to go into water\nHe does accept though that most of the research on the topic of making new friends would have already been done.So, in the hope of finding self-help literature on friendship, he has Leonard drive him to the bookstore. Sheldon is told to look for the books on making friends in the kids section. There Sheldon tries making friends with a little girl (reading the book \"Stu the cockatoo is new at the zoo\"), but Leonard makes him exit quickly before he is picked up as a pedophile.A children's book from the store helps Sheldon design an algorithm in flowchart form for making new friends. Sheldon starts by proposing dinner, then a beverage to Kripke and when he refuses, Sheldon tries to engage with him in a common activity\nHoward has to make an adjustment (introduce an escape to the least objectionable activity, combined with a loop counter) when Sheldon gets stuck in an infinite loop trying to find a common activity that he and Kripke can share (Horse riding & some other of Kripke's suggestions were not acceptable to Sheldon). This pays off when Sheldon goes rock climbing with Kripke, but Sheldon faints due to his fear of heights and is unable to complete even a kiddie course.Back at the apartment, Sheldon decides to cut off Raj as a friend to make room for Kripke as he feels managing 5 friends at a time will be onerous (Raj's answers to the questionnaire were most incorrect among them all. Sheldon is particularly angry since Raj picked the wrong amino acid as Sheldon's favorite.. The correct answer was Lysine and Raj picked Glutamic acid)\nKripke meanwhile is disgusting. He hits on Penny, flosses in the open and is racist towards Raj. However, when Kripke reveals he does not actually control computer access (there is an official access schedule and Kripke has absolutely no control over it), Sheldon dismisses him and restores Raj as a friend (since Raj likes monkeys and Kripke does not).Title reference: The algorithm created by Sheldon that he uses to make friends with Kripke.", "episode_7": "When Penny's TV cable is blocked after she fails to keep up with her monthly payments, she goes to the guys' apartment to watch America's Next Top Model, to Sheldon's despair and Howard's and Raj's delight.\nHowever, she accidentally touches Sheldon's onion rings (Sheldon is very specific about people not touching the food on his plate) and sits on his spot on the couch (she refuses to move as she decides to make a stand and tells Leonard that the longer they indulge Sheldon, the longer will be his resistance to learning that this behavior is not OK), thus scoring 'three strikes' including an earlier 'offense' (which was basically to forward him spam email, which Sheldon considers a breach of sacred trust. It was LolKitties in this case), so he banishes her from his apartment.Penny later refuses to serve him at the Cheesecake Factory (Which Sheldon points is against California state law and Cheesecake factory policy). After a fight with her manager, Sheldon forces Penny to wait on him and bring him food, but Penny dares Sheldon to eat it implying that she did something unsanitary to it.Their dispute escalates, with Sheldon blocking Penny's Wi-Fi access (he even gives one additional strike to Leonard, Howard and Raj for trying to help Penny out by circumventing his block) and Penny sabotaging Sheldon's laundry night (by engaging all the machines with her coins). Give Sheldon's OCD, he is terribly irritated at not being able to carry out his tasks as per his carefully laid out scheduleEventually, after Sheldon hangs her clean underwear (which he steals from the dryer in the laundry room which Penny had left unattended) on an outdoor telephone wire, Leonard gives Penny Sheldon's mother's phone number, \"Sheldon's kryptonite\", so Penny can complain to her about Sheldon (it will shorten the war by 5 yrs and save millions of lives-using the same argument that the Americans used to nuke the Japanese).\nSheldon's mother forces him to apologize to Penny and give back her laundry, despite Sheldon protesting that she touched his food and sat in his spot and basically started it..\nSheldon does that and Penny is no longer banished (She even pushes Sheldon to let her sit in his spot, but backs off when she sees that Sheldon is literally in tears at the suggestion). Sheldon warns Penny to use her power responsibly.Meanwhile, Howard finds out that the models in America's Next Top Model are in a house in Los Angeles. Determined to enter the house, he and Raj search for it using all available technologies, legal and otherwise (he gets a buddy of his at NORAD to fly over the area with a spy drone), and actually find it. They first find the house where 2 of the top models were sunbathing European style and then were able to get the exact address using Google Street view Trademark registered.\nHoward and Raj finally get in by posing as cable guys.

Failing to regain control of the Mars rover (Raj doesn't even try as he was busy checking his emails), Howard subsequently destroys all security tapes and hard drives relating to the mission (Howard calls this Plan B, although Sheldon is perplexed as to why this was not Plan A). Leonard starts having sex with Stephanie secretly. Stephanie admits that Howard had no chance with her (he was wearing an eye patch) and that she only went with him since he promised she could drive a car on MarsLater, Stephanie (who is a doctor) tells Howard that she has started dating Leonard (Howard had invited almost his entire family to meet Stephanie). Howard is angry at Leonard and pretends he and Stepahnie are dead to him, but Howard forgives the pair when she invites him to meet her friend Lisa on a double date.In the end, Howard hears on TV news that the rover found water on Mars at the bottom of the ditch (which is the first definitive indication of life on Mars), but because he had all the security data destroyed, it could not be determined who was responsible for this monumental discovery.Meanwhile, Sheldon and Raj play a game of rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock, \"The Lizard-Spock Expansion\" of the traditional rock-paper-scissors game, to decide who gets to watch what on TV, but they both choose Spock. Sheldon had invented this since the traditional rock paper scissors ended into a stalemate around 75-80% of the time.. yet the new game was not an improvement, since everyone always chose Spock.They, along with Howard, then play the game for Leonard's dumpling. When, again, all choose Spock, they conclude that someone must stop playing Spock. They try to determine who by playing the game but, yet again, all choose Spock.\nMeanwhile the mars rover sends back signs of organic life on Mars and since all data has been erased, there is no one to credit this discovery to.

He even tries to time Penny's ovulation cycle, since that would release pheromones and attract Leonard towards her (which would make Penny a distraction).However, Sheldon dismays Leonard by joining the couple when they have a romantic dinner (Sheldon feels Leonard is dropping the conversational ball with Stephanie, while Leonard was only feeling very awkward due to Sheldon's presence during his intimate dinner with Stephanie). Sheldon also joins the couple at the movies (Leonard hadn't told Sheldon when and where and had only had left a note saying \"Going to the movies\".. Sheldon went through Leonard's web search history to figure out which movie he was watching with Stephanie). Sheldon tries to find the acoustic sweet spot by making weird noises all over the theatre.\nBelieving that Leonard is losing Stephanie (Her Facebook page still has her status as single and she is sending digital sheep to a guy named Mike), he seeks Penny's help to figure why she didn't go out with Leonard, including if he was inadequate in the bedroom. Penny kicks him out after insisting that she and Leonard never got to the bedroom.Sheldon wants Leonard to open a recalcitrant jar of white asparagus in Stephanie's presence to emphasize his physical strength and establish his presence as the Alpha male. However, Leonard is not able to open the jar (even though it was pre-loosened) and accidentally shatters the jar (when he bangs it against the counter in a bid to open it up), cutting himself (& vomiting when Stephanie tells him that he will need stitches.. Sheldon was defrosting a stake in the sink where Leonard vomited). Stephanie gives him the necessary stitches at her hospital and later tells him she will not be sleeping with him that night as planned, as he needs rest (Leonard had cried during the process of getting the stitches, although he insists that his eyes only watered up as someone was driving a needle into his flesh).At home, Leonard finds Sheldon hacked his Facebook account and changed his status to \"In a relationship\" and yells at him for attempting to intervene in a relationship in which he has no experience.Howard says this, after only two weeks, makes Leonard appear desperate, but Raj then discovers Stephanie apparently changed her status to \"Stephanie Barnett is in a relationship with Leonard Hofstadter\".

Sheldon considers it a compliment, but he just doesn't see the connection.Leslie Winkle calls Howard and ends their \"Casual_relationship or friends with benefits\" relationship. Sheldon first asks if Leslie provides Howard with health insurance. Leonard explains the phrase to Sheldon who then finds that kind of relationship very practical to reproduce without any emotional attachment. Howard on the other hand has an emotional reaction to the break-up partly because he has seen her naked. Sheldon surprisingly suggests that in Nevada there is a city where people can forget their problems and replace them with new problems, such as alcoholism, gambling addiction, and sexually-transmitted diseases. The guys get excited as Raj asks \"Is it me, or is that Sheldon's way of saying 'Las Vegas or VEGAS, BABY!!'??\"Sheldon is walking up the stairs with Penny carrying his take out dinner in an exceptionally good mood. His dinner consists of Kadai Paneer. It is Indian food (which Raj loathes), containing copious amounts of peanuts (which would reduce Wolowitz to a 97-pound wheezing blister) and includes Paneer, a farmer's cheese (which would cause Leonard to make any room uninhabitable within five minutes). Sheldon asks Penny not to disturb him in his Fortress of Solitude. (\"That's Superman's ice-thingy, right?\"), He even finds Penny's tenuous grasp of the English language folksy and charming. Then Sheldon shouts \"Noooo!\" as he doesn't have his key and has locked himself out of his apartment. Penny quips, \"What's wrong, Superman? Locked out of your big ice-thingy?\"In Vegas, Leonard and Raj are preparing for their night in their hotel room. Leonard needs some aftershave and can choose from Howard's drug store collection of colognes, musk, pheromones, and condoms. Howard is poring over Leslie's Facebook page while Raj and Leonard head downstairs. Raj says that he needs a plan in case one of them gets lucky. Leonard agrees if he finds a woman, he'll take her to his stately manor in Gotham City, and if Raj hooks up, he'll find a bunk for the night on the moon.In Penny's apartment, Sheldon laments that he didn't take his key out of the bowl next to the door. Penny goes to get their emergency key which she left in their apartment when she went to borrow some milk. Sheldon had mentioned a few episodes before that some of the milk was missing. (You're the milk thief!) Penny invites Sheldon to have dinner with her until the apartment manager comes to let him into his apartment. Sheldon objects in a southern drawl, \"Eat my dinner?

A woman asks Raj if he wants to party which interests him until Leonard tells Raj that it'll cost him money to party with her. Howard's messages are getting more and more depressed so Raj suggest that they hire the prostitute to cheer Howard up. Leonard is against it until Howard mentions that he is about to open a $20 jar of peanuts and end it all.Sheldon and Penny are having a quiet dinner together while Sheldon attempts some small talk and asks about her day though he really doesn't care about it.Leonard and Raj approach the woman named Mikayla (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe) and ask her to help cheer up Howard without him knowing that she was hired by them. She proposes to give him the \"girlfriend experience\". Raj then asks her to give him the Jewish Girlfriend Experience.Sheldon and Penny are now playing 20 Questions and Penny asks if Sheldon is Star Wars, one of Penny's standard answers. Sheldon was the character Spock, another standard answer for him. Sheldon then asks \"Are you and Leonard \"friends with benefits\"?\" Penny denies it and asks if Leonard had said that. Sheldon said no and then said that he had noticed Howard was in that type of relationship and ended up crying like a little girl. Penny replied that some people can't handle that kind of relationship. Sheldon then asked Penny if she could and she abruptly ended the conversation as very uncomfortable for her.Howard is convinced to come downstairs due to the guys raving about the marvelous shrimp bar when Mikayla steps up behind him and says \"Boy, would it kill them to put out a nice brisket?\" Howard immediately turns around and says, \"I'm Howard Wolowitz.\" Mikayla replies \"Hi, I'm Esther Rosenblatt.\"Penny is preparing the couch for Sheldon to sleep on; however, he objects and does not want to reenact Snickering's beloved children's book \"The Tall Man for Cornwall\" since the couch is too short for him to sleep on. Penny then reluctantly gives Sheldon her bed if he \"shuts his hole\" for the next 8 hours.Meanwhile, Howard is getting to know 'Esther', whose turn-on include reading in front of a fire, long walks on the beach, and getting freaky on the Sabbath with a bacon cheeseburger. After her \"Oy Gevalt, you're hot\", Howard goes and asks the guys if she is bought and paid for. They admit the truth and he whispers \"Thank you!\"Back in apartment 4B, Sheldon can't sleep. He asks her to sing \"Soft Kitty\" since he is homesick, which is a kind of like being sick. So she can get back to sleep Penny starts to sing, but messes it up and Sheldon has her start over. Sheldon tells her, \"Penny, thank you for letting me sleep over.\" Really touched Penny replies, \"Awww, you're welcome sweetie.\" Then he says \"I'm sleepy now, you can get out,\" which sends Penny off peeved.Leonard returns home, and Sheldon is very happy to get back into his apartment. Leonard wants to know why he was at Penny's and Sheldon gives him a brief account of the previous evening. Also he now has a much better understanding of \"friends with benefits\" which, as often the case, confuses Leonard.", "episode_2": "After the guys return from a Renaissance fair (Sheldon complains about the historical inaccuracies, like not using the right Lenin, wearing modern underwear and so on) and see Penny with her new boyfriend Eric (Travis Schuldt). The guys were all dressed to the tees in their period costumes.\nThe guys tell Leonard to move on from Penny and get on with his life. Leonard is approached in the Caltech canteen by Leslie Winkle (Sara Gilbert), who proposes renewing their one-time \"relationship\". She says that she got a text from Howard saying that Leonard's brief relationship with Penny has crashed and burned and that he is available again.\nLeslie has grown out of one-night stands she suggests they take it slowly (who better to take it slowly with than Leonard), first determining their compatibility on all levels before proceeding to full sex (if at all); Leslie recommends dinner at his place, light petting, no coitus. Leslie is still very clear about what she wants from LeonardSheldon knows we are not in the matrix as else the food would be a lot better.When Leslie comes over, Leonard asks Sheldon to leave the apartment (Sheldon only agrees when Leonard says that he would do the same for him, if Sheldon ever got a female guest of the same species to the apartment and wanted some privacy with her). Sheldon wanted to play Mario on his laptop on a poorly coded Nintendo emulator (his mother had sent him his Nintendo PlayStation just recently).. To continue his video games, Sheldon has to take an extension cord and sit at the stair case, waiting for Leonard and Leslie to finish their date. He frequently interrupts them by going to the bathroom and getting things from his room..\nDuring their dates, Leslie asks how many children they should have and evaluates Leonard's genetic defects (male pattern baldness and lactose intolerance).\nPenny dumps Eric after unsuccessfully using him to make Leonard jealous (including a competitive make-out session between Penny and Eric and Leonard and Leslie, Leslie helping Leonard make his point that their relationship is hotter than theirs).During the second date, when Sheldon is again sitting on the staircase, playing Mario, he runs into Penny again.\nSheldon tells Penny he is uncomfortable with Leonard dating his arch enemy Leslie, but on Penny's advice he accepts the relationship. Penny says that as a friend Sheldon has to support Leonard's choices in lifeAlmost immediately, however, Sheldon deliberately provokes an argument with Leslie over the validity of loop quantum gravity, which Leslie supports, and string theory, which Sheldon & Leonard favors. Leslie expects Leonard to back her beliefs, but when he supports Sheldon, Leslie dumps Leonard, to Sheldon's relief. Leslie is worried about how they would raise the kids, and when Leonard suggests that their kids would make their own choices, Leslie is even more horrified as they are kids and incapable of making their choices\nSheldon then comforts Leonard with the fact that it's only nine months until Comic-Con.Title reference: Sheldon stating that the Renaissance Fair was just an excuse to wear a codpiece.", "episode_10": "Stephanie effectively moves into Leonard's and Sheldon's apartment, though Leonard does not acknowledge this. Stephanie gives Sheldon a physical examination as he claims to have tinnitus. Stephanie insists that there is nothing wrong with Sheldon, even though he is not convinced. When bacterial infection is ruled out, Sheldon convinces himself that he has a tumor.\nSheldon modifies the roommate agreement to give Stephanie her own shelf in the fridge (with the fridge door being now used as the common area), vacuum frequency is increased from 2 to 3 times a week due to more dead skin cells, a modified bathroom schedule, since women have different needs to men.Stephanie is alarmed to see Penny coming into the apartment in the morning in her underwear.\nPenny, initially unaware of Leonard's new relationship, shows up in the guys' apartment. Leonard panics (Sheldon is oblivious to the crisis while Penny takes particular pleasure in seeing Leonard squirm in front of his new girlfriend) and has to admit to Stephanie that he never slept with Penny, even though they dated a while back.Penny then searches Leonard's room with him, discovering various signs that Stephanie is indeed living with him. Printed bed sheets, Stephanie's jewelry box, her dresses in their wardrobe closet, and the final straw Leonard missing bat signal from his shelf. This convinces Leonard that Stephanie is now living with him in his room.After Stephanie buys Leonard new clothes (a particularly uncomfortable pant that is made from wool-fire ant blend) that he later hates as he itches all over the body due to them (and machine watches them with a lot of fabric softener after Penny tells him that they will be ruined that way), he realizes (after talking to Penny) that his relationship with Stephanie is moving too fast for him. Penny also convinces Leonard that he is entitled to voice out what he feels is going as per his wishes in the relationship, and get his partner to acknowledge it, mutually accept it and then work towards changing it.He repeatedly tries to tell Stephanie to move out, but each time she diverts him by initiating sex. He tries to tells Stephanie that he needs space and she starts crying. This again forces Leonard to back down and he simply says that he really likes her. The next day he goes to the University wearing a sweater gifted by her.Meanwhile, Sheldon sneaks into the hospital to test himself, as his tinnitus has not stopped. He asks Stephanie to authorize a bunch of tests, including a upper GI, full body MRI and so on, which she refuses as she feels Sheldon is healthy and fit.\nWhen Leonard next returns to the apartment, Stephanie has diagnosed Sheldon with a fake larynx inflammation and instructed him not to speak at all, a procedure she calls a \"Sheldonectomy\". Sheldon takes this very seriously and stops talking, to the relief of everyone in the apartmentTitle reference: Sheldon cannot understand why the third-floor neighbor, Mrs. Vartabedian, dislikes him, after Leonard claims that Penny is just a neighbor like Mrs. Vartabedian, with whom he frequently has breakfast in his underwear. Sheldon cannot understand why he has never been invited to breakfast by Mrs. Vartabedian.", "episode_12": "Howard designs a combat robot, M.O.N.T.E. (Mobile Omnidirectional Neutralization and Termination Eradicator) for the \"Southern California Robot Fighting League Round Robin Invitational\" or the SCRFLRRI, which the guys plan to enter.\nWhen Penny arrives at the apartment, Howard begins to flirt with her but pushes it too far, and she furiously lashes out at him with some uncomfortable home truths (she says Howard thinks he is a smooth talking ladies man, but is really pathetic and creepy. Nothing will ever happen between him and Penny. He will just grow old & die alone).Hurt and depressed, Howard returns home and remains in his room, refusing to go to work or meet friends. Leonard persuades Penny (she owes him one from the day she sent Leonard and Sheldon to pick her TV from Kurt. Kurt was physically very dominating and as a result Leonard and Sheldon had returned home with no pants) to go to Howard's house and apologize.\nHoward tells Penny about all his failed romances (Marcie Grossman his high school sweetheart who had an overbite), and she consoles him by saying that he is a good guy at heart and he just tries too hard to get girls.\nHoward feels there was a moment between him and Penny. He thereupon tries to kiss Penny, who intercepts him with a punch that breaks his nose.Howard is left happy, feeling he is halfway to 'pity sex'. Meanwhile, the guys' co-worker Barry Kripke (John Ross Bowie), who is also entering the competition, challenges Sheldon and the guys to a one-on-one fight between their robots. Kripke's robot is called the Crippler.\nSheldon accepts, but Kripke's robot turns out to be far superior to M.O.N.T.E. and, with engineer Howard indisposed, Barry can easily win. Raj, Leonard and Sheldon watch a video of the Crippler on YouTube, demolishing a full sized family sedan. Leonard tells Sheldon to call off the match, but Sheldon refuses as he believes MONTE is their ticket to make a stand for all the humiliation at the hands of bullies during their school years. Sheldon refuses to back down and even engages in trash talk with Kripke (He says he is given to understand that Kripke's mother is overweight, but withdraws the comment if the obesity is due to a granular problem and not gluttony)Sheldon refuses to concede defeat (he tries to upgrade the robot, but doesn't know how to open the toolbox) (the only upgrade he makes is to change the batteries in the remote). Kripke again offers to spare MONTE before the start of the fight, but wants MONTE as spoils of victory, which Sheldon refuses. As the fight starts, Kripke unleashes a fire cannon on Crippler and Sheldon has no option but to run away with MONTE. Kripke follows it throughout the university.M.O.N.T.E. is destroyed by Kripke's robot.\nThe guys return home and Sheldon tries to fix MONTE. But Howard says that MONTE is unfix-able. Penny offends Sheldon by saying that its just a robot and Sheldon runs into his room to cry, since he was emotionally attached to MONTE. Penny has to go to Sheldon to apologize to him as wellTitle reference: The killer robot created by the guys.", "episode_19": "Penny comes down the hallway in Apartment 4A, telling them that she killed the spider in the bathroom. As they sit down to dinner she mentions that the neighbors upstairs in Apartment 5A are moving out. This statement bothers Leonard because he hadn't told Sheldon who is freaked out by this revelation. Though he had never met them, they were the perfect neighbors because they never made any noise. No awkward hellos in the halls, no Clickety-Clack of high-heel shoes on hardwood floors. They might have well been a family of cats just jumping around from drape to drape, Howard suggest that he could move in upstairs to get way from his mother to which Penny uses Sheldon's earlier exclamation, \"The horror! The horror!\"The guys are willing to help Howard to move. Sheldon has negotiated it up to a Sony PlayStation 3. He refused the mountain bike. Howard's mother decides to threaten Howard with cutting the cord completely if he moves out. Also, Penny no longer needs to put her head in the oven.Back at the apartment lobby, they find moving boxes and meet their tall, blonde, hot new neighbor Alicia (Valerie Azlynn). Leonard is immediately smitten, but Sheldon is not yet impressed. He has a few questions for Alicia. He asks if she is light-footed, a salsa, Irish folk, or break dancer, fertile (crying infant possibility) and pro-rug. Her answers make him to welcome her to the building.Alicia has Leonard carrying a heavy box up to the 5th floor. They run into Penny dressed in a \"Hillary 2008\" t-shirt. Alicia claims to be dressed like a slob, but isn't. They leave as Penny's jealousy shows and she imitates Alicia. Sheldon amazingly picks up and does his Admiral Ackbar impression from Return of the Jedi.As Sheldon is \"air computing,\" Penny comes in looking for Leonard so he can hook up her printer as promised. Leonard is still up at Alicia's, hooking up her stereo with Howard and Raj. Penny seems to have issues with that as well as her jealousy shows again.Up at Alicia's Howard is trying to hit on her as Leonard works on her stereo. Penny walks in, under the guise of presenting a welcoming bottle of wine to Alicia, with high heels and a blue dress that leaves as little to the imagination and complaining that she is dressed like a slob. Leonard tells her that Alicia is also an actress with several national commercials and a recurring role on soap opera. Alicia has their full attention with a wink and a few \"sweeties\" and \"honeys\" thrown in. Penny asks Leonard to set up her printer and she gets \"Don't nag me!\" She tries a physicist's joke that bombs before a liquored-up Raj hits on Alicia.An angry and dejected Penny returns to Sheldon, who is unaffected by Alicia. He is complaining about the noise from upstairs and talking about a special he saw on bees. Sometimes a new queen bee enters a hive and they have to have a battle to the death. Penny asks if he thinks she is threatened by Alicia and that it's time for her to go. Scared at that thought, Sheldon insists was just talking about bees, not trying to give her advice. Penny then states that she was doing the same thing, while she finally understands the offensive physics joke she told the guys.Penny now tries to win back favor with the guys by buying them Chinese food. She even follows Sheldon detailed instructions (diced instead of shredded, brown rice, mustard and low-sodium soy sauce from the market.) She is offering to play Halo or watch \"Battlestar Galactica\", when Alicia comes to the door. She needs a ride to an audition where she would play a hooker who gets killed. Leonard runs out to give her a ride; Howard will practice lines with her. Afterwards Alicia will take them out for Chinese food...even though there's Chinese food right in front of them. Alicia even got Howard to drive to Orange County, California to get her television like Penny got Leonard and Sheldon (Pilot) to do though Penny considers that apples and oranges. Penny complains about the way Alicia treats the guys, when Sheldon points out that she got the incorrect mustard.Penny is very upset with Alicia and decides to confront her about it the next day in the laundry room. Alicia was underwhelmed that physicists don't make a lot of money. Penny explains that her guys are special and don't know how to use their shields like on Star Trek. Penny is shocked that she is using a Star Trek metaphor. She doesn't want her to take advantage of them. Alicia gets ticked off and says that she does the same thing. After she calls her a b*t*h they get into a fight. All the guys come into the lobby and find the girls fighting. Howard is excited and holds back Leonard knowing that he'll break it up.Later, Penny is having dinner and is a mess with a black eye, busted lip, and chipped tooth. Penny lost the fight, but she won back the guys. Howard tells her that she looks great to and she accepts the compliment. Howard realizes that her spirit is broken. The stereo comes on from upstairs. Per Howard, she is seeing one of the producers on her show. Noise comes from the bedroom as Penny comments, \"Dead whore on TV, live one in real life.\" Sheldon then complains that the couple is merely jumping up and down on the bed while Penny realizes they are having some heavy-duty sex. Even Leonard and Penny can't explain to Sheldon's what is she doing up there.", "episode_22": "The gang is at the comic book store, when a specific new comic book came in. Howard announces that he will treat them with new comic books to celebrate his new invention, the \"Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Waste Disposal System\". Stuart approaches the gang and asks Leonard for some advice for his second date with Penny, Leonard says he will think on it. Howard tells Leonard if he doesn't want to jeopardize his relationship with Stuart nor does he want Stuart to progress with Penny, he should tell Stuart to do exactly what Leonard has been doing for the past two years.Later, Leonard bumps into Penny when getting his mail, Penny seizes the opportunity to ask Leonard whether she dating Stuart bothers him. Leonard tells her it doesn't, although he was clearly lying, as Penny then proceeded to ask for advice on dating Stuart, but Leonard gave her useless advice (be aggressive).In the Caltech cafeteria Leonard receives a phone call, but doesn't want to answer it because it is from Stuart, and he knew he would be asking for advice about Penny. The unanswered telephone ring annoys Sheldon who insists that Leonard answer the phone. Leonard refuses, Sheldon continues with an illustration that Stuart might be calling because the store is on fire. Leonard asks why Stuart would be calling him if the store was on fire. Sheldon continues that, we won't know until you answer the phone. Finally it goes to voice mail. Leonard says that the problem was solved, but Sheldon insists that he check his voice mail. Leonard again refuses. Sheldon instructs Leonard that leaving a message is one half of a social construct, the other half is listening to the message. Leonard comments that it must be hell inside your head. Sheldon replies that it is at times.Meanwhile, a distressed Howard tells the gang that he made a fatal error in building his invention. In an effort to help Howard, the gang has agreed to fix the space toilet. They bring an exact replica back to the apartment.Then, someone knocks on the door, and Leonard answers it. Howard reminds Leonard that the project they are working on is classified. Stuart is at the door asking Leonard for last minute advice since they haven't been able to contact each other, Leonard has been deliberately ignoring Stuart, although he tells Stuart that his phone is broken, his e-mail is broken, everything is broken. Leonard deliberately gives bad advice by drawing from what he has been trying on Penny. He tells Stuart to take it slow, hold her on a pedestal like your afraid to even touch her, and avoid eye contact with her. Stuart thanks him and says that it plays right into my wheelhouse. Stuart asks what is the item in the room. Howard says, \"You don't know! Good!\" and slams the door in Stuart's face. Raj comments about his advise to \"Be afraid of Penny. Nice.\" Leonard admits that it wasn't bad advice, it just wasn't particularly helpful advice. Sheldon comments that his mother says that when we deceive for personal gain - Jesus cries, which of course makes Leonard, who is already feeling bad about what he told Stuart, feel even worse.The gang continues to troubleshoot the space toilet. Howard brings up several possible fixes only to have them shot down by Sheldon who explains why they won't work. Finally Howard suggests that he change his name and go live with his cousin in Israel. Sheldon says that could work.The next morning, Leonard was doing a coffee run for the gang and took the opportunity to stop by Penny's and ask about the date. When he asked Penny, she was very wound up and ended up slamming the door in Leonard's face. Leonard then leaves for the comic book store to meet Stuart, while the rest of the gang still fails to fix the toilet. Leonard asked Stuart about the date, he said the advice he gave him was great. Everything was going smoothly. Leonard surprisingly said \"It did?\" After two hours and a bottle of wine they were making out in his car. Leonard said that he didn't tell him to give her wine. Stuart said it didn't matter, that is were everything went wrong. They were kissing and he said \"Oh Penny,\" and right where she was supposed to say \"Oh Stuart,\" she said your name. Leonard asks, \"She said Leonard?\" Stuart said, \"That is your name.\" Leonard, sympathizing, said it must have been the last thing you wanted to hear. Stuart said that it beats, \"You know I'm a dude right.\" When Leonard leaves the store, he jumps with happiness.While Leonard has been running around talking to Penny and Stuart, the rest of the gang has continued to work on Howard's space toilet. They are ready to test the fix. Howard gets a Tupperware container with some of his mother's meatloaf, slices off a piece, and places it in the toilet. Raj asks if that is how you test a toilet. Howard assures him that his mother's meatloaf has been testing toilets for years. When he initiates the test the meatloaf slice flies out of the toilet and sticks to the ceiling. Raj asks what the problem could be. Howard replies, \"Not enough bread crumbs.\"It seems Howard has found a solution and called the responsible parties to deploy the solution, he just hopes it works.The gang and Penny are all together in 4A eating while Howard is talking with a NASA official about the fix. He assures them that the fix was entirely confidential; nobody will know about it. Penny asks Leonard about the fix. Leonard says its Howard's space toilet - I'll tell you later. Penny then asks Leonard to pass the soy sauce. Pretending not to hear he asks if she was talking to him. She said I did say, \"Leonard.\" Leonard replies, \"Yes you did, didn't you.\" Penny of course did not understand. Just then, the meatloaf falls off the ceiling, startling Penny.In the final scene, we see that Howard's solution clearly did not work as the crew of the space station had to take \"an unscheduled EVA (Extra vehicular activity or spacewalk)\". NASA asked who would be participating. The replay was that everyone wanted to step outside for a little while. NASA said they couldn't authorize the EVA. ISS, replied that this was more of an FYI call - they were already out the door.", "episode_23": "Leonard is working on his whiteboard trying to find an error that Sheldon insists is there, but will not help him with. As suddenly as Bazinga, Leonard finds out that he has fallen for one of Sheldon's classic pranks. Sheldon finds out that Caltech President Siebert wants to meet with him at eight o'clock tomorrow morning, which gives Sheldon eighteen hours to think about it.Early the next morning Sheldon is knocking on Leonard's door to tell him about his uninvited visit to the president's house. His grant from the National Science Foundation to go the magnetic North Pole to look for evidence of slow moving mono-poles (in order to validate string theory) has been approved. Leonard perked up that the president offered to send him north. Sheldon replied, \"In fact, he was quite enthusiastic. He said \"quite frankly, if I could send you tonight, I would.\" Sheldon's interest in going is incredible since he has to leave the movie theater if he gets a brain freeze from his Icee.Leonard, Raj, and Howard are excited about being Sheldon-free for three months and all the small victories they will have like sitting in his spot. On the contrary, Sheldon proposes that they accompany him as his support staff for the project. At first they decline to spend three months in a hut with an \"anal nut bag,\" as Howard puts it, but the idea begins to grow on Leonard and Raj since if Sheldon is successful it would mean a massive boost to their careers. Howard is concerned that being put in a situation like that would make him snap and cause him to become \"the engineer who builds the crossbow that kills Sheldon\". Finally they decide to go along to be part of the team that make such paradigm shifting discoveries. Raj figures that due to his suffering it will result in a karmic payback of becoming a \"well-hung billionaire with wings\" in the next life. Howard agrees to go due to peer pressure.Sometime later, Sheldon goes over to ask Penny a favor by knocking on her door. Before he can perform his second set of knocks, Penny echoes him with \"Knock..knock..knock...Sheldon\". A competition starts as they start going faster and faster. (Penny..Sheldon..Penny..Sheldon). A very stressed out Sheldon then asks if he can have access to the Cheesecake Factory freezer. Penny reminds him that she had already told him that the freezer is cold enough and safe enough to keep his hamburger fresh. He really wants to borrow it so they may practice acclimating themselves to the cold for their expedition to the North Pole for three months. Penny is surprised and goes to confront Leonard asking why he hadn't told her. Leonard explains that they were spending their time getting physicals, buying thermal underwear and studying snow. Penny declares that it is no big deal and that she'll check on the ice box thingy. Leonard wonders if she is upset and Sheldon correctly guesses that she is.Sheldon gets his time in the Cheesecake Factory freezer. His crew must practice using tools in the extreme cold which Sheldon had to improvise. Leonard is using an old calculator. Raj paints sideburns and a Van Dyke beard on a six inch high action figure. Howard must operate using a vintage Operation game. None of the guys is accomplishing his task in the cold, when they realize that they could assemble the equipment in the warm cabin before taking it outside. This thought never occurred to Sheldon who remarks, \"I guess we're done here.\"While enjoying a hot chocolate with a stick of butter or a stick of \"I Can't Believe It's Not Butter\" for the lactose-intolerant Leonard, Raj is in an argument with his parents about going on the North Pole. Howard had convinced his mother to let him go so he puts them on the phone together. Then she cries, \"Arctic? I thought you were going to Arkansas!\" Penny asks to see Leonard who is happy to removed himself from the arguments. Penny then presents him with a blue blanket with sleeves, a Snuggie that she saw on an infomercial to keep him warm while he does his science stuff. Penny hugs him, which Leonard returns. Her hug lasts so long that he hugs her twice. She leaves and Leonard returns to apartment 4A looking confused. Meanwhile, Mrs. Wolowitz is exclaiming that she can't understand why there's not a single Outback Steakhouse in all of India. That night Leonard is wondering whether he should go because of Penny. Sheldon tests him that he shouldn't go which also turns into one of his classic pranks. Bazinga!Early the next morning Leonard knocks on Penny's door holding his Snuggie. He asks about the \"I'll miss you,\" and she replies that he'll be gone and she'll miss him. Then he asks about the blanket and Penny quips that wine, credit card and late-night TV is a bad combination. Finally he wonders about the long hug that lasted at least five Mississippi's. Penny tells him that it was just a hug and she wishes him a safe trip. She closes the door and leaning on it sighs to herself, \"It means I wish you weren't going.\"At the magnetic North Pole, as usual they are preparing Thai food, though reconstituted. The hut is set up with the same furniture arrangement as Apartment 4A. After considering that they are at the top of the world they decide on a movie marathon of Ice Station Zebra and John Carpenter's The Thing. Howard whispers to Raj to forget the crossbow, and find him an icicle.", "episode_15": "Leonard becomes worried when he learns his mother, accomplished psychiatrist and Neuro-Scientist Dr. Beverly Hofstadter (Christine Baranski), is coming to visit.\nOn arriving, Beverly meets Penny; by the time they have climbed the stairs to Leonard's apartment, Penny is in tears after being psychoanalyzed over her childhood issues with her father. Her father wanted a boy and called her slugger till she developed breasts. after which he stopped talking to her or playing ball with her.. When Beverly meets Leonard she comments that to have intercourse with Penny, one only needs to know the cologne use by her father.Sheldon, on the other hand, immediately develops a comfortable relationship with Beverly, who turns out to be as strict and logical as himself. Leonard meanwhile goes out of his way to earn the praise of his mother. He brews her tea following the exact protocol that she prescribed, step by step, but Beverly rejects the tea as too cold, making Leonard start all over again. This is very much like how Sheldon acts with his food.\nBeverly discusses many topics which embarrass Leonard, including that she and her husband only had sex for reproduction. Sheldon finds this arrangement \"efficient\".Leonard despises his childhood as Beverly looked at her like a project (she would attach electrodes to his brain to monitor his activity during potty training). Sheldon complains that Leonard was lucky, since he had to attach his own electrodes.\nHoward and Raj meet Beverly too, but after learning that Howard still lives with his mother (Howard claims that he pays rent) and Raj cannot talk to women due to Selective Mutism, she is quick to declare that they are in an \"ersatz homosexual marriage\".Leonard later goes to talk to Penny and they comfort each other by discussing their respective childhood issues with their parents (Leonard built a hugging machine when he was 10 to have some human contact) (both his siblings are much more successful than he is, in their respective fields). After becoming drunk (they were doing tequila shots and after a while Penny had Leonard licking the salt from her neck), Penny and Leonard end up in bed together and are about to have sex, but Leonard ruins the moment by invoking psychiatric theory, implying that he is effectively having sex with his mom and she with her dad.\nHorrified about this, Penny throws Leonard out of her apartment.\nShe wants to talk about it the next day, but Leonard assures her she never has to talk to him ever again.Meanwhile Beverly and Sheldon are alone in his apartment and Sheldon tells Beverly that he is very comfortable around her. It seems like that they are talking about having sex, but They end up on the karaoke together.\nThe next morning Beverly leaves and Penny walks down the flight of stairs with her. By the time they reach the lobby, Penny is again in tears saying that her mother never supported her against her father\nTitle reference: Leonard's mother visiting him.", "episode_14": "Sheldon is ditched by his friends when he places too many constraints on where they can watch a movie. It has to be a Sheldon approved theatre (with a good sound quality equipment), within range of a Sheldon approved restaurant and the theatre should have Icees. He refuses to consider Slurpees as Icees or refuses to have a late dinner since that would mean that next day's bowel movements would occur at work. Sheldon agrees that the guys had no other option but to ditch him\nPenny is in financial difficulties as her car broke down and might even need to find a new place to live. After discussing this with her (and reminding her that her check engine light was on & it will cost $1200 to fix the engine), Sheldon does the logical thing and lends her some money which she can repay at her leisure. Sheldon says he uses approx 50% of his income for expenses and the rest is hidden around the apartment and he has no use for it.\nPenny deliberates for a few moments before helping herself to the cash.Penny gets very sensitive after taking the money and interprets every single comment from the guys as a personal indictment on her frivolous lifestyle. She gets very particular when Sheldon notices a package delivered to Penny which she admits contains a beret. She claims that the beret was back ordered and arrived late, and was not purchased with Sheldon's money. Later she pays Leonard $14 for the dinner that she eats in their apartment after Raj and Howard insinuate that Leonard lets Penny eat dinner because she wears tight jeans and tank topsShe confides in Leonard that her big plan was to waitress for 6 months and then become a movie star (Plan B was to be a TV Star).\nWhen Leonard learns about Penny's problems, he tries to help her cut her expenses (like switching off cable, stopping the acting classes and so on), and in the process learns that her ex-boyfriend Kurt owes her $1,800 (he took a leak on a cop car, while being drunk and also had a bunch of warrants against him). Penny is too proud to ask for her money back from Kurt, but knows that helping Kurt out has landed her in her current situation.\nPenny wants to move to a cheaper apartment, and Leonard argues against it.Without telling Penny, Leonard and the guys go to Kurt's place to recover the money. Leonard has to convince the guys pretty hard to confront Kurt again, given the fact that Kurt took away his and Sheldon's pants the last time.\nThey are unsuccessful, though Kurt writes \"I owe Penny $1800, Kurt\" on Leonard's forehead in indelible ink.Penny later repays Sheldon after Kurt unexpectedly repays her but, much to Leonard's disappointment, Kurt did not tell Penny about Leonard's visit, instead taking the opportunity to try to get back together with her.Title reference: Sheldon shows he is very willing to help his friends financially when he offers to help Penny.", "episode_6": "This is the time around when Sheldon starts using the 3 knocks on door bit with Penny, which was not there in the previous episodes\nAfter a lecture by Leonard and Sheldon, a graduate student named Ramona Nowitzki (Riki Lindhome) is so impressed by Sheldon that she insinuates herself into his life as his platonic girlfriend/assistant/manager, to the puzzlement of Penny and the guys. She approaches Sheldon at the university, flatters his work endlessly and sounds creepy.\nShe is a bit of a stalker, who already has Sheldon's address. When Sheldon wont go out with her (due to fear of non standard cutlery (3 tinned forks - which are not forks, but a trident) in unknown restaurants), she starts bringing food to his place.Penny wonders if Sheldon is into weird sex stuff. Howard postulates that Sheldon will reproduce by mitosis. He believes that one day Sheldon will eat too much Thai food and then split into 2 Sheldons. Leonard instead postulates that Sheldon is the larva of his species and one day will grow a cocoon around him and then emerge as a butterfly with wings and an exoskeleton.Ramona proves to be a helpful influence on Sheldon's work (she saves him time by standing in cafeteria lines on his behalf and bringing him food), even bettering his rival Leslie Winkle in a verbal confrontation.. Leslie starts by calling Sheldon dumb-ass and says that he should prepare his papers for the Smithsonian museum of Dumb-Assery. Ramona retorts saying that they have no space for Sheldon till they remove the permanent Leslie Winkle exhibit. This forces Leslie to back off.But, Ramona moves into his apartment to control him, prohibiting his usual recreational activities (she stops him from going to Raj's on Halo night) and forcing him to concentrate solely on his research. No paintball, no comic book store, no Battlestar Galactica. Eventually Sheldon realizes that he is in \"some sort of relationship\" with Ramona, and seeks help from Penny and Leonard to get rid of her, but without success.\nRamona even approaches Penny and suggests that Penny might be in love with Sheldon, as he is too lovable and begs her to love Sheldon go as he is meant to make bigger contributions to humanity. Penny is speechless when Ramona proposes to be sisters with her.Sheldon eventually makes a research breakthrough he tells Ramona he would never have achieved without her, and gratefully asks how he can repay her.

After much pestering by Sheldon, Penny goes with them. Once at the comic book store, Penny meets Stuart (Kevin Sussman), the guy who owns the store, and a good friend of the guys'. Meanwhile, Sheldon and Howard get into a fight over a comic book (All-Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder #8 variant), (Sheldon needing it for his Robin collection and Howard needing it for his Batman collection). After Howard is distracted by Penny talking to Stuart, Sheldon wins and gets the comic book. Penny agrees to go out with Stuart as long as Stuart gives Penny the sketch he just drew of her.The following night, Leonard sees Stuart and Penny leaving for Stuart's opening at a local gallery and immediately becomes jealous, while they are about to embark on \"Friday night the way it was meant to be\" featuring the buggy beta version of Zork (much to Sheldon's pleasure). Leonard tells Howard to take him to a bar to meet women.Once they arrive at the bar, Raj annoys Howard by ordering drinks that Howard considers unmanly, including a Chocolate Martini, a Brandy Alexander, and his signature Grasshopper. Howard leaves Raj at the bar, and he and Leonard strike out by themselves. Leonard quickly learns that Howard isn't the ladies' man he claims he is. He insists on letting the \"important men\" (lawyers, jocks, etc.) thin the herd so they can pick at whoever is left. He also tries to pick up women with silly party gags, instead of just talking to them. Not surprisingly, no women want to talk to them. When Leonard questions Howard about it, Howard states that Leonard is weighing him down. Leonard doesn't believe it. Howard decides they should give up and go, when they spot Raj making out with an overweight woman. Both are stunned, and Howard is especially baffled, unable to understand how Raj got a woman and he couldn't.Meanwhile, as Stuart and Penny return to her apartment for a cup of coffee. Stuart thinks that a \"cup of coffee\" means the beverage and not making out together. Sheldon runs into them in the hallway.

Raj is foreign and exotic, while Howard can talk to women without being drunk.Howard ponders over how to approach Summer (It must be hot, since it is Summer)..\nRaj drinks a beer before being the first to approach her (he steals Howard's pick up line and swoops in before Howard makes his move), and they get on well (he regales Summer with his knowledge of the starts and the constellations) until Howard discovers Raj actually drank non-alcoholic beer, which apparently had a placebo effect, and points this out to Raj who thereupon reverts to his usual Selective Mutism.Howard then takes over, but creeps Summer out with his awkward style (he talks about fart goblins and dreams where he tore Summer's legs off while dancing with her). Howard finally withdraws after Summer pointedly refuses to go out on a date with Howard, although she agrees for a selfie, but again refuses when Howard asks for a selfie which seems like they were making out\nLeonard finally gets his chance (after Summer rejects Howard), but Summer gets off the train before he can introduce himself.Meanwhile, Sheldon realizes he forgot the USB flash drive with the paper he wants to show to Smoot, and needs extensive help from Penny to find it (she has to enter the apartment and enter Sheldon's room, which no one is allowed to enter) and email it to him. The flash drive is locked in Sheldon's drawer. The key is hidden in his room and people are not allowed to enter his room.

Amy is also talking to Raj as if Lucy is not even there. Lucy is getting more uncomfortable and runs off to the bathroom. Raj tells Amy that they might as well eat since she is not coming back soon.Penny and Sheldon are shopping for the party which makes no sense to Sheldon since the store didn't have a party section. Sheldon mentions that she might not continue being Leonard's girlfriend since there is a tradition that men at sea turn to each other.

Howard tells Raj that Bernadette is cranky after working seventeen-hour days-and he's been spending a lot of time playing Assassin's Creed. Raj and Stuart decide to throw a Valentine's Day party at the comic book store for all those who don't have dates. Stuart likes the idea. Raj explains that they can celebrate the greatest love a man can have, himself.In Sheldon's office, Sheldon finds Alex and asks her to work on a research project he is having a problem with. Alex is excited to help him with his scientific work. Sheldon dismisses her remark and wants her to find Amy a Valentine's Day gift. She tells him that she passed up a job at Fermi-Lab to work with him. He gives her $2000 in various crumbled bills and tells her he thinks Amy likes monkeys and the color gray.In his lab, Howard creates a micro-valentine present for his microbiologist wife. Over 12 hours, which really took time away from his video game playing, he used an atomic force microscope from the materials science lab to write his and Bernadette's initials in a heart 1/1000th the size of a grain of sand. Howard then accidentally breaks his gift when he removes it from the microscope, so Leonard invites them to come to dinner with Penny and Leonard.At Sheldon's place, Sheldon tells Alex that Amy will be showing up shortly expecting the perfect Valentine's gift and tells Alex to dazzle him. Alex checked out Amy's Facebook page and chose three potential gifts for Sheldon. The first was a harp music box that plays one of her favorite songs. Sheldon counters that she has a real harp that can play any song. Next Alex knows that Amy likes The Canterbury Tales and got her a map showing the characters' journeys. Sheldon tells her that she already has Google Maps on her phone. Since Amy is a NeuroScientist, she researched the subject and found a signed drawing of a brain cell made by Santiago Ram\u00f3n y Cajal, the father of modern NeuroScience. Sheldon likes the drawing so much that he keeps it and waves away Alex's protest that the gift was for Amy by declaring \"I called dibs.\"At dinner, Penny loves the restaurant. Howard and Bernadette show up fighting because Howard didn't wash her clothes and he had been playing Assassin's Creed, so she hid his Xbox. Bernadette tells them that she had been working late every night and that all she asked him to do was to clean the apartment and do a load of laundry. Penny notices at another table a couple she despises (her old boyfriend and the girl that broke them up). First, she notices that the woman has lost a lot of weight. The guy immediately gets down on one knee and proposes. Leonard sees how upset Penny is and says that two can play this game. He gets down on one knee, but Penny tells him to get back up.Raj and Stuart are getting ready for the party which Stuart is looking forward to because there is no place that he would rather be than his comic book store. Raj counters except on a date with anyone, which Stuart agrees with. Raj then says that they get along so well, that is a shame that he's not a girl whom he could take home and have wild sex with. Stuart looks concerned after Raj's last comment.Back at the restaurant, Penny can't believe that he is marrying the woman he cheated on her with. Leonard thought it was nice that she was at one time the wrong girl and now she's the right girl. Penny claims that this Valentine's Day sucks and Leonard adds that it's because of her. They continue to argue as Howard and Bernadette feel that their conflict was minor compared to Leonard and Penny's and they make-up. Howard tells Bernie that they'll leave early and he'll go home and do her laundry. Bernadette tells him that he'll find the Xbox in the washing machine.Amy shows up at Sheldon's door telling him \"Happy Valentine's Day\". Sheldon merely agrees with her. Amy says that she had planned a traditional night of romance while Sheldon planned on faking enjoyment and had worked on a new smile to go with it. After much contemplation, Amy felt that she was being selfish, canceled their dinner reservations and came up with a new plan. No romance or gifts. They are going to stay at home, order a pizza, and watch one of his beloved Star Trek things (movies). Sheldon found that to be the most amazing gift anyone ever gave to him. Sheldon then shows Amy that she is down as his In case of emergency contact at the university, which brings Amy to tears that he trusts her that much.Penny and Leonard come up the stairs with her saying good night and Leonard replying \"Yep\" as she goes into her apartment. Leonard turns around and walks in without knocking. First, he tells her that he tried to give her a romantic night and she went out of her way to destroy it. Penny agrees and says that she is a total bad person. She explains to Leonard that everything is going so well with them and that she is really happy, which confuses Leonard. She finally admits that she has some commitment issues. Since things are going well, she explained, you're going to keep asking me to marry you and someday she'll say yes and they'll be married forever and the whole thing freaks her out. Leonard agrees that he proposes to her a lot. Then, he says that he will never propose to her again. Penny is taken aback, afraid that he is breaking up with her. He assures her that he isn't-- just that when she is ready; she can be the one to propose to him. He does, however, say that if that time comes, she has to get down on one knee, give him flowers, and sweep him off his feet, but no Jumbotron proposals. Penny agrees.Back at the comic book store, Dale (Josh Brener) is talking to Raj and Stuart thanking them for the party. Dale says that usually on Valentine's Day he is sad and alone, but tonight he is just sad. They wonder why everyone has to be so sad on this night. Raj makes a nice speech that they aren't mutants just because they are alone. They should not define their self-worth as to whether they are in a relationship. They are a community as long as they have each other. Then a girl named Lucy (Kate Micucci) approaches Raj telling him that his speech was cool. Raj thanks her and asks her to go out for coffee. As he leaves, he tells the guests, \"Later, losers!\"Finally, in her lab, Amy finds that she is getting a lot of emergency calls about Sheldon since she is his point-of-contact, which does not thrill her, but she still goes to help him.Title reference: Each of the couples shows some tangible affection to each other during this special Valentine's Day episode.", "episode_14": "Raj tells everyone of a website where one can buy an action figure made in their own image.

Sheldon doesn't want one because the hands of the action figure do not feature Kung Fu grip.Kripke (John Ross Bowie) and Sheldon are both are working on separate grant proposals for a new fusion reactor and the university can only submit one proposal, Kripke and Sheldon have been directed by the university to work together. Sheldon dismisses the idea since he considers himself one of the great minds of their generation.Leonard and Howard are in Howard's lab and Leonard notices the strange place on the wall where Howard has hung one of his wedding pictures (made by a laser). When Raj brings in their $500-a-piece action figures, Leonard asks how they can afford them. Howard replies that Raj is loaded, and that he (Howard) is able to afford it since his wife (Bernadette) has a really great job, that she comes with fun bags and money bags. Raj's action figure is African-American and Howard's action figure has a really big nose. Leonard jokes that maybe Wesley Snipes and Toucan Sam just got action figures that look like them.Penny and Leonard return from a movie and in the apartment they hear the Star Wars Darth Vader theme (\"Imperial March\") playing loudly. Leonard describes it as Sheldon's \"I'm unhappy and about to destroy the planet\" music. Sheldon is found wearing a afghan wrapped around his head in the style of Emperor Palpatine's dark hood. Sheldon complains that he is being forced to work with Kripke and that he is outraged and not upset. He then tells Leonard that tea is (only) for when he is upset, to which Leonard changes the offered beverage to hot cocoa and Sheldon accepts. Sheldon continues that Kripke is going to come along and ruin all his great work which makes him angrier than ever and fills him with despair. Penny asks Sheldon what beverage he needs for that, Leonard interjects by offering Sheldon a cup of hot apple cider with cinnamon sticks. Sheldon snaps at him while agreeing wholeheartedly with the offering.The next day, Sheldon tells Kripke to give him his paper first so he doesn't publish Sheldon's work under his name. Kripke says that Sheldon could steal his and do the same thing. They exchange and Kripke finds an envelope full of blank paper. He gives Kripke a second envelope. Kripke, however, suspects that Sheldon gave him another envelope of blank paper, and warns Sheldon that if he finds the second envelope is also filled with blank paper, that he will get very angry. Sheldon acknowledges the failed ruse, reaches into his desk, and gives Kripke a third envelope, this envelope actually containing his research paper.In Howard's lab, Raj suggests that they could get better action figures with \"three words\": 3-D printer. Howard has always wanted a 3-D printer and admits that he could use it to make prototype parts out of plastic for his work. Raj also wants to make Malibu Koothrappali and his Barbie's Dream House.While Sheldon hangs out with Amy. Sheldon is upset because discovered by reading Kripke's paper that Kripke's work was leaps and bounds more advanced than his. Sheldon starts to cry and Amy offers him a consoling hug. Sheldon says that he has nothing to lose and allows Amy to proceed.The next day, Sheldon pretends to be sick in an attempt to avoid going to work. Sheldon offers Leonard a thermometer of his temperature as proof that he is ill. Leonard reads the thermometer which is displaying 128 degrees Fahrenheit. Leonard replies that Sheldon must have warmed the thermometer in his hot tea.\nLeonard tells Sheldon that his research just went down the wrong path, something that even happened to Albert Einstein. Leonard yells at Sheldon like his mother to snap him out of his zone.Raj and Howard are admiring their new 3-D printer to which Howard remarks that they are reclaiming jobs from sweatshops in China and returning manufacturing to the United States. Raj looks at the 3-D printer and says that the 3-D printer was made in China. After only three hours, they succeed in making a whistle worth twenty-five cents. Howard has Raj make a superhero pose so that he can scan him into the computer.Kripke enters Sheldon's office and notes that Sheldon's paper is inferior. Kripke says that Sheldon has a girlfriend and is distracted by having sex all the time. He tries to explain that his work is suffering because of \"all the laid\" he is getting. Sheldon plays along with Kripke's (incorrect) postulation that Sheldon having frequent sex with Amy is the cause of his poor scientific work, saying that Amy loves his genitals and that bumping their bathing suit parts together is magic.Howard shows Bernadette his new action figure and an action figure he made of her. She asks Howard how much the two action figures cost, and Howard answers that he made the action figures with a used 3-D printer that he and Raj bought for $5000. Bernadette gets upset because she thinks that is too expensive, and that he didn't talk to her before spending that amount of money Bernadette says that if he doesn't return the machine that he can make a set of lady parts with the 3-D printer and sleep with them.While having dinner with Leonard and Sheldon, Penny asks Sheldon why he didn't just tell Kripke the truth. Sheldon replies that the ridiculous boldfaced lie made him look better.\nPenny asks Sheldon whether he is ever going to sleep with Amy. She tells him that they (Sheldon and Amy) have been going out a long time and Amy clearly wants that type of relationship. Sheldon admits that he is quite fond of Amy and that he has always had problems with the kind of physical contact that comes easily for other people; however, he has begun working on it, and mentions recently putting vapor rub on Amy which a year ago would have been unthinkable. Sheldon replies that it is a possibility that at some point Amy and he get physical. This admission stuns Penny to the point of grabbing Leonard's arm and mouthing \"Oh my God!\"At the cafeteria, Raj is seen writing Howard a check to purchase Howard's half of the 3-D printer. Howard instructs Raj to make the check in Bernadette's name, since Bernadette took Howard off their joint checking account until he learns the value of money.Sheldon and Kripke are working together in Sheldon's office and Kripke wants details on Sheldon's previous night with Amy. Kripke asked whether he gave it to her good, and Sheldon replied that he gave it to her well (correcting Kripke's grammatical error). Kripke also wanted to know if they used any (sex) toys. Confused, Sheldon replies that he has a model rocket next to his bed which really cracks up Kripke, to which he happily exclaims, \"A Wocket? You're a Fweak, I Wuv it!\" at Sheldon.Title reference: Barry and Sheldon trade roles: Kripke does superior work and asks inappropriate questions in a Sheldon-like manner; Sheldon takes a Barry-like interest in normal human socialization.", "episode_7": "Sheldon is taping a special \"Sheldon Cooper Presents: Fun with Flags\" episode about \"Star Trek\" flags, and invites his friend, Wil Wheaton, as a guest. During the taping Amy, who is filming and directing the show, keeps describing Wil's acting as too wooden or not fun or upbeat enough. Wil insists that he is a professional actor and that he is doing this web broadcast for free. Amy replies that they still are not getting their money's worth.\nWil says that he cannot do this gig if Amy is going to be a pain in the ass. Sheldon is now caught in the middle and does not want either his friend or girlfriend upset. Amy wants Sheldon to ask Wil to leave. Sheldon objects that Wil Wheaton was a minor celebrity and he could not do that. Amy offers to leave in frustration. Sheldon doesn't get the sarcasm and agrees.In Howard's old bedroom after dinner, Bernadette wants to know why he does not keep his stuff at their home. Howard wonders what she means when all he has here is a few sweaters, books, bank stubs, computers, mail, collectibles, medicine and his electric body groomer. He says that it's late so why don't they spend the night there. Bernadette objects and said that after he got back from outer space he'd move to their place; however, they spend half their nights at his mother's house. He tells Bernadette that he gets it and he'll move his stuff over this weekend.Sheldon returns to his apartment after raising \"heck\" with Wil Wheaton at the Hometown Buffet. Leonard asks about his plans with Amy and Sheldon replies that she went off in a huff after Wil called him a pain in the A-S-S. Leonard suggests that Amy was mad at him because Wil was rude to her and then he went to dinner with him. Sheldon calls Amy and is surprised to realize that Amy is indeed mad at him and expected him to take her side against Wil.Howard and Bernadette are having dinner at the Cheesecake Factory. Bernadette asks about moving his things out and then he explains that he can't do it on the Sabbath. Bernadette points out that this statement is from a man eating a bacon cheeseburger. Penny returns and tells Bernadette that he is never going to move out. Bernadette agrees. Howard promises to move out and begs Bernadette not to leave him.Sheldon shows up at Amy's door with a gift because she is mad. It's a complete \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" DVD set so that she can became familiar with Wil Wheaton's body of work. He says that Amy has not seen Wil's work and hence doesn't know that he is a national treasure. Amy slams the door in his face.Raj and Leonard are helping Howard move. He used to masturbate a lot in his room. Howard points out where his mother marked his height over the years and the desk underneath which on Halloween when he was five and ate a peanut piece of candy and he went into his first case of Anaphylactic shock. He figured out he was allergic on the third candy bar with nuts.Sheldon shows up at the Cheesecake Factory bar to talk to Penny about women. He wants something more than chamomile tea because he had a rough day. Penny suggests a Long Island iced tea to calm him down. Sheldon says that the trouble is with her gender and that their second X chromosome contains nothing but nonsense and twaddle. Sheldon can't understand why they don't like each other since they are both crazy about him and he likes them.\nHe downs one Long Island iced tea. Penny explains that the problem is not Wil Wheaton; the problem is how he treated Amy. She continues that Amy had been insulted and Sheldon did not stand up for her. They start talking about how those in Texas are supposed to defend their women-folk. Sheldon replies that he has evolved beyond his simple rustic upbringing; however he says: That low down polecat done wronged my woman. (Penny: Welcome to Long Island, Tex.) Sheldon thinks that Amy deserves better. Sheldon complains that he is a callous egomaniac and that she's going to leave him. Penny disagrees. Sheldon changes his tune and says that she won't because he is great.Howard moves in the last box to their apartment and announces that Bernadette is now the only woman who is going to see him naked in the bathtub. Bernadette tells him that his mother is a grown woman and will be fine. Howard tells her that he has just felt responsible for her ever since his dad left. He started doing magic to entertain her. He put on a show and asks someone to come up and be his beautiful assistant and she would come up and smile. For a few moments she would forget how lonely she was. Bernadette says \"Oh, crap\" and starts to get some of his things so that they can spend that night at his mother's house. Howard insists that he wants to live here.Sheldon stumbles up to Wil Wheaton's door and knocks twice forgetting how many times he had knocked. Wil notices that Sheldon had been drinking, though Sheldon claims that it was tea though the best tea he had ever drank. Sheldon tells him that he is from Texas and is here to defend his woman's honor. Finally, he remembers that it was two knocks and does his final one.

He then gets sick and throws up in Wil's bushes.The Star Trek \"Sheldon Cooper Presents: Fun with Flags\" episode continues with new guest star LeVar Burton who is working for food and gas money. Again, Amy is complaining about the acting and that it is worse than Wil Wheaton. Sheldon mentions that he is obligated to agree with his girlfriend.

Alex asks Leonard if he has any plans for the weekend, going on to say that she will be attending a lecture on subatomic space-time by Caltech theoretical physicist Kip Thorne, which Leonard finds inviting. She invites Leonard to go with her, but he is unable to go due to having plans with Penny. Alex suggests that the two of them could discuss the lecture over dinner, stunning Leonard and causing him to knock over the Jenga blocks.The next day at the cafeteria, Leonard tells Howard and Raj about Alex asking him out. A peeved Raj accuses Leonard of enjoying the situation. He makes it clear that he loves Penny and has no plans of taking Alex up on her invitation, though he does enjoy being desired by two attractive young women at the same time.Sheldon tries to decide what to do about Alex and seeks the advice of Penny, Bernadette, and Amy, referring to them as 'Sheldon Cooper's Council of Ladies'. He tells them about the situation, using fake names in an attempt to conceal the identities of those involved, though the three women quickly deduce who he is talking about. Sheldon refuses to admit who he is really speaking of, and continues to refer to Leonard as Ricardo Shilly-Shally, Alex as Tondelaya Della Ventimiglia and himself as Doctor Einstein Von Brainstorm.When an infuriated Penny asks Sheldon if Leonard returned any of Alex's advances, Bernadette and Amy reassure her that Leonard would never cheat on her. Bernadette tells Sheldon that if Alex is doing something to make Leonard uncomfortable, he should confront her and tell her to stop. Sheldon, however, unknowingly makes the situation worse by replying that Leonard isn't uncomfortable since he is enjoying Alex's attention, which upsets Penny even more.Later in his office, Sheldon attempts to confront Alex about what he perceived to be an inappropriate sexual advance on Leonard. Alex denies it, saying that she only invited him to dinner. Sheldon continues to tell Alex that he doesn't like what she did, and tries to discourage her from pursuing Leonard by making a misogynistic comment (stating that she's an egg salad sandwich on a warm Texas day: full of eggs and only appealing for a short time). Despite Alex telling him that he is making her uncomfortable, he continues and calls her a slave to her desire to reproduce. To finish, he shows Alex an illustrated book on sexually transmitted diseases in hopes that she will be discouraged from having sex with Leonard. Alex rushes out of the office.Back at their apartment building, Leonard and Penny meet in the hallway. Penny asks Leonard about his good mood twice to see if he will tell her about Alex asking him out; he doesn't (he's in a jovial mood due to listening to the radio while Sheldon was asleep in the car, and taking an online quiz that got him Captain James T. Kirk after four tries), but he tells Penny that he will be in an even better mood once he spends some time with his \"special girl.\" She asks if he means her or Alex since she knows that he enjoys Alex's interest in him. Leonard looks stupefied and Penny storms off.Leonard asks Sheldon if he told her about Alex. Sheldon replies that he had, and had gotten no good advice (still believing that the situation is about him). Leonard tells him that he shouldn't have told Penny that he was being hit on as it's never a good idea to let a girl know if someone's flirting with her man. Sheldon then gets a call to report to the Human Resources department, since Alex has filed a complaint that he had acted inappropriately.Janine Davis (Regina King), the human resources administrator who enforces political correctness including sexual harassment at Caltech, tells Sheldon that Alex has filed a complaint. Sheldon says that he led his assistant away from a life of promiscuity. Mrs. Davis tells Sheldon that he had said things that he shouldn't say in the workplace like calling her a slave and calling her an \"egg salad sandwich\". Sheldon said that he sees the confusion, adding that he was not trying to single her out; he said that all women are slaves to their desires, including Mrs. Davis, who is African-American. He calls her a slave again, especially during certain points of her menstrual cycle. Mrs. Davis, getting agitated, tells him to shut up. Feeling intimidated, Sheldon rats Howard, Raj, and Leonard out in an attempt to direct her anger away from him: Leonard was bragging about his sexual desirability to anyone who would listen; Howard spent two years using university resources to built a \"six-breasted sex robot\"; and during last year's office Christmas party, Raj repeatedly referred to Mrs. Davis as \"Brown Sugar.\"At the apartment building, Leonard plays a musical apology for Penny on his cello. She accepts the apology. Penny adds that she is feeling very insecure about their relationship, but Leonard reassures her that nothing is ever going to happen between him and Alex. Leonard then gets a call to report to the Human Resources department, as do Howard and Raj; none of them know why.The guys are sitting outside Mrs. Davis' office waiting to be called in, and Raj is adding alcohol to his coffee in order to speak to her. Howard points out that he was often called in before he met Bernadette, to the point where he and Mrs. Davis are on a first-name basis, as Leonard correctly points out that the only reason why they were called in was because Sheldon threw them all under the bus during his interview. Raj erroneously blames Leonard for starting this in the first place; if he hadn't been \"screwing around\" with Alex, none of this would've happened, despite the fact that she was the one coming onto him. Sheldon shows up and announces that he is filing a complaint against Mrs. Davis because the explicit language she used during his interview made him uncomfortable. The four are then called into the office.Sometime later, Sheldon sits down and apologizes to Alex because it had been pointed out to him that his language in dealing with her was offensive, adding that he has to take online sexual harassment training. He then asks Alex to take the online course for him as part of her duties because he is so busy.Finally, Penny starts looking at science classes at her local community college, since Alex can talk to Leonard about his work and she can't. She decides that they are all boring. Instead of trying to be a scientist, she decides to look like one and buys a pair of black-rimmed eyeglasses Leonard is initially skeptical, but becomes extremely excited when Penny puts on the glasses and says, \"Molecules.\" Then they head for his bedroom to off all her clothes except the eyeglasses and the boots.Title reference: Sheldon, quoting his late father who compared women to an egg salad sandwich on a warm Texas day: \"full of eggs and only appealing for a short time.\"", "episode_3": "Penny brings in a box for Sheldon from his mother and he tips her a dollar. Sheldon had his journals and research he wrote as a child sent to him. Since the verification of the existence of the Higgs-Boson particle, the scientist that postulated its existence a half a century ago, Peter Higgs, could be heading to a Nobel Prize. Sheldon wants to check his earlier work to see if he already hit upon an idea to get his Nobel Prize. He needs someone to read through these notebooks since he thinks his time is too important to do the task himself. First he asks Leonard, who declines.Penny volunteers; however, she couldn't even understand the title of a paper Sheldon wrote at the age of five: \"A Proof That Algebraic Topology Can Never Have a Non-Self-Contradictory Set of Abelian Groups\".\nAt Leonard's suggestion, he hires a graduate student, an attractive student named Alex Jensen (Margo Harshman). She does flatter him during the interview and thinks it's an honor to work for him. Sheldon makes sure that she doesn't do drugs including coffee, has no hearing loss due an ear infection she experienced years ago, and that she has paid all her parking tickets. She is willing to do everything he asks her to do. Raj is attracted to her, but since Raj wouldn't speak to Sheldon and Leonard in front of Alex, Alex wondered what the matter with Raj was.Penny is giving Amy a makeover which she wants to show Sheldon. Amy tells Penny that if it leads to phone sex, Penny will have to leave the room. When Alex answers Amy's video call to Sheldon, Amy is shocked when she learns that Alex is a girl. Alex tells Amy that Sheldon left a message not to be disturbed unless it's Stephen Hawking, his mother or himself from the future. Amy is upset and confides to Penny that while Sheldon told her that he had a new assistant named Alex, he did not tell Amy that Alex was a girl, to which Penny wondered if he even noticed.Amy gets Penny to go to Caltech to meet Sheldon's new assistant. Amy bursts into Sheldon's office, but doesn't find him there though does leave her scent by grabbing various items and licking them or rubbing them into her armpits. Amy leaves her scent to keep Sheldon interested and admits that she's done the same thing in Penny's apartment before they became best friends.In the cafeteria, Alex brings Sheldon his yogurt to his usual exact specifications with the exception of leaving one cherry stem on the bottom, leaving Sheldon \"disappointed.\" Leonard invites her to join them, but Sheldon doesn't want her to after seeing how servants are treated on a PBS British series (referring to the show Downton Abbey). Leonard urges her to sit down anyway and impishly suggests that she talk to Raj about her dissertation about asteroids. Predictably, Raj silently gets up and moves over to the next table, prompting a smug look from Leonard and a silent head shake from Sheldon. Leonard continues speaking gregariously to Alex and she starts getting flirty, laughing at Leonard's jokes and complimenting him on his sense of humor. Amy and Penny secretly observe her actions from the doorway, and it becomes clear to Amy that she doesn't have to worry about Sheldon since his assistant appears interested in Leonard. (\"That \"bad person\" YOUR problem, not mine\").Penny downplays these actions by insisting that everything is fine and that she remains uncertain of where her relationship with Leonard is right now. Amy explains that although the PreFrontal cortex of Penny's brain is telling her there's nothing to worry about, the Limbic system is telling her that Alex's attraction to Leonard must mean that he's desirable. Penny goes back and forth before eventually admitting to herself: \"OK it bothers me!\"That night while having beer and Hors d'oeuvres, Penny keeps asking Leonard about his day, but he never mentions Sheldon's new female assistant. Sheldon then shows up with Alex, announcing that she may have found something in his grade school science project report that could be his ticket to a Nobel Prize. Penny introduces herself to Alex, who mistakes her for Leonard's assistant. Penny replies that they were working on a five-year experiment (an on-off relationship), which confuses both Leonard and Sheldon. Alex replies that she is sure that a lot of people would want to work with someone as talented as Leonard. Penny quips that a lot of people can't, and then she takes Leonard to her apartment because her Limbic system wants to take his pants off (i.e. have sexMeanwhile, Howard tells Bernadette that being cooped up in \"this old tin can\" for weeks on end is getting to him. He asks her to drop something so he can watch it fall. In another video chat, Howard tells her that due to the delay of the Soyuz capsule that is supposed to pick up the astronauts, he will have to stay in space for an additional 7-10 days. He is suffering bad anxiety attacks, starts sounding paranoid, and gives her crazy ideas on how she can rescue him. He also starts talking to her in code. Eventually, he is captured by the other astronauts, held down and given a sedative. It makes him feel better though he begins acting strangely afterwards, such as taking off his pants and wind milling in the capsule. Bernadette then tells him to put his pants back on.Title reference: Sheldon, observing the recent success of the Higgs Boson particle, wants to unearth a discovery he may have made during his childhood that could earn him a Nobel Prize.", "episode_15": "Leonard immerses himself in the sixth installment of the \"Harry Potter\" series. Sheldon thoughtlessly ruins the surprise by revealing that Dumbledore meets his demise. Irritated by Sheldon's lack of consideration, Leonard points out that had he been the one to spoil a major plot point, Sheldon would have complained endlessly. Leonard counters by expressing his frustration with Sheldon's annoying and controlling nature, as well as his dissatisfaction with their current living arrangement. He reiterates that Sheldon is, without a doubt, the most vexing person he knows before storming off. In response, Sheldon cites the provisions of the Roommate Agreement, but Leonard dismisses it by disposing of the contract. Unfazed, Sheldon cites section 27, paragraph 5, comparing it to the American flag that should not touch the ground.

Even his label maker has a label on it, as does that label.Raj is already drinking their wine, when Sheldon, Amy, Penny and Leonard arrive. Penny smells something good cooking. Since Sheldon eats Thai food that night, Bernadette went to the Thai market and made his usual meal from scratch.

Bernadette then snaps to her husband to show Sheldon the closet.Sheldon comes in and asks if Howard wants his clothes arranged by color or seasonally. Howard tells him that by color is fine. Sheldon contradicts him and tells him that they will be arranged seasonally. Amy doesn't mind since he spent an hour in the supermarket optimizing the cheese aisle. Afterwards the assistant store manager chased him out of the store waving a salami.

Howard burns the letter.At Penny's apartment the girls are having wine. Amy is curious about what was in the letter. She points out that they could ask Sheldon since he read it.

She quickly says, \"That works.\"Down in the Laundry room Sheldon is using rubber gloves to clean out the dryer lint container. The girls enter and Sheldon greets them asking what he can do for them. Penny then asks what Howard's letter said. Sheldon doesn't feel like he can tell them since he is bound by closet organizer-organizer confidentiality. Sheldon says that just because he knows what it says, he cannot go around disseminating the information freely because control of the information belongs to Howard. Penny says that the letter was found in Bernadette's closet and doesn't that count for something. Sheldon then asks, \"Are you pointing out that California is a community property state and since Howard and Bernadette are married the intellectual property contained in that letter is jointly owned by the two spouses?\" Penny looks confused and then agrees.

Bernadette asks if he can take a break because she has a little surprise for him. Howard tells Bernadette that he is in no mood to have sex that night. He finds everybody in their living room. Leonard explains that when he left they didn't know whether he wanted to know or not, so they have a cool solution. Sheldon explains it using various quantum states of matter. Sheldon continues that if each person present him with an account of the letter with only one being true, he will forever be in a state of Epistemic ambivalence.\nRaj describes a birthday card that said \"Happy eighteenth birthday. I love you. Dad.\" Sheldon says that the envelope contained a map to the lost treasure of the pirate One-Eyed Willy. Howard points out that that is the plot from The Goonies.\nAmy says that his father was secretly in the auditorium at his high school graduation and he cried because he was so proud of him. Howard asked \"Really?\" Sheldon says that her story is poppycock and that it could still be the map. Amy looks quite disappointed. Penny tells him that the letter explained that his Dad wasn't who he said he was and that his previous life caught up with him and the only way he could keep his mom and him safe was to leave. Sheldon then changes his story that the pirate's name was Peg-Leg Antoine.Leonard describes how he thought that family was the most important thing and that Howard should not throw it away like he did. Bernadette finishes with describing a picture of his father holding Howard on the day he was born and on the back was written: Howard my son, my greatest gift. Howard is very touched. Sheldon wants to know which one he thinks it is, \"matey\". Howard again says that he doesn't want to know, but he does want them all to be true. Sheldon then admits to have read some saucy passages from Bernadette's diary. Sheldon assures her that her secrets are safe with him though copyright laws allow him to quote snippets in the context of a review.All are having a good time back at the apartment, Howard and Bernadette are dancing. Howard is feeling better, but if he had known they were going to dance, he would have worn his flats. Penny says that it turned out pretty well and Leonard agrees. Sheldon enters with questions from cleaning out Penny's closet. He finds a dead goldfish that Penny had forgotten about. He also asks if she had a dog because he found a battery operated \"chew toy\" [her vibrator]. Embarrassed, Penny jumps up, says that the party is over, and pushes Sheldon out of the apartment.Title reference: Sheldon organizes Howard and Bernadette's closet.", "episode_2": "At Bernadette's apartment, Penny and Amy are helping her sort through her wedding presents. Sheldon's gift, a gravy boat, is engraved with instructions to return it should the couple get divorced. Amy says that she plans on marrying Sheldon in four years, but she tells Bernadette to not tell Sheldon about it because he is still a flight risk. When Penny is asked about Leonard, she keeps saying that he is a great guy. Bernadette thinks that Penny does not sound like she is in love. Penny admits that the feelings she has for Leonard are not the same as the feelings she had when she was in love before. She doesn't want to tell him that she loves him because he would just take it the wrong way.Meanwhile, Raj, Leonard, and Sheldon are talking to Howard at the International Space Station and Howard tells them he cannot believe that he is on this incredible adventure. His Russian crew member then tells him to go clean the space toilet since he is the new guy; and that next time, they might even let him use a brush.The gang, minus Bernadette (who doesn't come), goes to a movie and Stuart tags along, claiming that Raj invited him. Sheldon insists that he acts just like Howard would and among them, he has to eat Raisinets. He also asks Stuart where he went to school to compare him to Howard. Stuart attended an art school, which Sheldon thinks is equally ridiculous as Howard's education so Stuart passed his test.\nDuring the movie, Amy insists that Sheldon holds her hand, which he hesitantly obliges to do. He sees that Leonard is not holding Penny's hand. Amy tells Sheldon that Penny may be breaking up with him. Sheldon does not believe her because Penny is seen drinking Leonard's diet (and germ filled) Dr. Pepper.\nFor the sake of argument, Sheldon asks Amy what she means about Penny wanting to break things off with Leonard. Amy tells him that Penny is not sure how she feels about Leonard. Amy tells him that regardless, he has to keep it a secret, something Sheldon openly admits he does not like to do.Later in Sheldon and Leonard's apartment, Sheldon is in a dilemma about whether or not to tell Leonard about the secret. Sheldon succumbs and decides to tell Leonard anyway. He uses Transformers as an analogy about Leonard's relationship with Penny, by telling him that what he sees outside can mean a different thing inside, just like how their current conversation about Transformers can actually be regarding one of them in the room. Leonard misinterprets Sheldon's words as pertaining to him and how he used to be a heartless robot, but after meeting Amy he maybe becoming a red-blooded man with sexual desires. Sheldon tells Leonard that that was the stupidest thing he has ever heard.Sheldon attempts to tell Leonard again during the early morning hours, but instead he goes into Penny's bedroom waking her up as she screams hysterically. Sheldon beats around the bush telling Penny about Leonard's great attributes as a boyfriend, until Penny asks him what Amy had said. Sheldon replies that he had heard that she was thinking of breaking up with Leonard. Penny patiently tells him that it is sweet that he is worried about his friend, but that her relationship is none of his business. He asks her to keep dating Leonard no matter how she feels and to keep everything in \"homeostasis\" or unchanging, the way that Sheldon likes his life. Finally Sheldon leaves and asks her \"not to hurt my friend\".Amy gets an early morning phone call from Penny complaining that because of what she had told Sheldon, she was now in a terrible position. At the same time, an incoming call from Sheldon comes and he tells Amy that he is calling just to give her the heads up since he has told Penny about the secret. Amy says that Penny is already on the other line.Bernadette is talking to Howard at the ISS who complains about his fellow astronauts being mean to him. She tells him to stand up and tell them that \"being mean is lame, but being nice is cool\". She asks if she should call NASA, and Howard replies that his mother already did that and it made things worse.Stuart is playing Mystic Warlords of Ka'a with the rest of the gang and plays a card that Sheldon says Howard would not play. After changing cards, Sheldon goes out and wins. Stuart and Raj are going out to a bar to pick up women. Sheldon suggests that Leonard go along to find a back-up for Penny because of her illogical death-defying actions, though he thinks that they may be breaking up.Later Penny and Leonard are having dinner at her place. While Leonard is telling her about Sheldon's misadventures at the dentist, Penny seems very distracted. Finally she says that she has to tell him something. Leonard sits back, looks at her with what Penny describes as his big sad eyes and she appears conflicted again.Later, at Howard and Bernadette's Apartment, she tells the girls about what happened and Amy exclaims, \"You slept with him?\" Penny says that she was looking into his big sad eyes and could not tell him. Penny demonstrates and Amy replies that it is a good thing that she does not have a dog. Bernadette tells her that she will have plenty of times to break-up with him like on their wedding day, their honeymoon or their 50th anniversary. Leonard texts her telling her how amazing she is while Amy and Bernadette look at her with big sad eyes.Finally Bernadette is again talking to Howard about how her idea worked and that he got a great night's sleep. Unbeknownst to him, his fellow astronauts had drawn a mouse's face, whiskers, glasses and his nickname \"F. LOOPS\" on his face. Bernie gives him a \"proud\" face and does not tell him that she knows.Title reference: Penny contemplating whether or not to break up with Leonard given her uncertainty about her feelings in their relationship.", "episode_9": "While having lunch in the CalTech cafeteria, Raj insists that zombies and mummies are the same thing. Sheldon joins in the argument at Leonard's request and explains that a zombie bite will turn one into a zombie, while a mummy bite will only turn the victim into \"some schmo with a mummy bite.\" Howard has bought a new car. He adds that if they want to check it out, it's parked out front in space 294. Sheldon insists that is his parking spot, even though he doesn't have a car and can't drive. To him, the parking space is perfect since it is a corner spot reducing the possibility of door dings in half, it's 28 spaces from the front entrance, it has a tree to shade it from the sun on hot days, and a \"delightful squirrel\" lives in the tree. Leonard points out that the university probably reassigned since he wasn't using it. Howard refuses to move his car, so Sheldon tries to push Howard's parked car out of the space unsuccessfully.Later that night, Sheldon disturbs President Siebert at home about Howard being assigned his parking place. President Siebert points out that Howard is an asset to Caltech since he is an astronaut that worked on the International Space Station.The next day, Howard enters Sheldon's office demanding his special edition Iron Man helmet back; however, Sheldon tells him that since he isn't using it. Like the parking space, he took it since those are the rules they are now living by. Howard then takes Sheldon's diploma off the wall. Sheldon yells at him that it's the only doctorate diploma he'll ever get.Penny, Bernadette, and Amy are walking up the stairs returning from a bikini waxing with Amy having had her first. Not only is Amy walking bow-legged, she required much more work that her friends. First, the girls talk about how silly the feud was. Amy can't understand Sheldon because he wouldn't take off that \"stupid robot mask\". Howard was so angry that Bernadette mixed up Benadryl in his ice cream to get him to fall asleep. Amy then describes Howard's trip into outer space as his \"little moment in the sun\". Bernadette follows with maybe Sheldon can get another parking spot if he ever makes a worthwhile contribution to science. Penny tries to change the subject as the insults escalate. Bernadette says that she is sensing some hostility from Amy because like Sheldon's work her sex life is also theoretical. Amy counters that at least when they have intercourse, Sheldon won't be thinking about his mother and his need to crawl back into her womb. Bernadette storms out & Penny looks very distraught.The guys enters Sheldon's apartment while discussing vampires and zombies and they come in to find Howard sitting in Sheldon's Spot naked using his laptop as revenge. They again demand their stuff back though Howard thought Sheldon would be more upset about his computer sitting on Howard's \"male junk\".At night, Sheldon and Amy sneak onto the parking lot and spray paint Sheldon's name over Howard's onto the parking space wheel chock. Amy feels all excited; however, she feels it may just be the result of her recent bikini wax. Sheldon tells her to keep an eye out for campus security which she calls \"freaking cops!\" Amy is asked to park her car in the parking spot, but first she shows Sheldon her bikini wax results. First Sheldon asks if she is high on spray paint fumes and then notes that there were an awful lot of Band-Aids used.Penny and Bernadette are looking at her wedding photos when Amy storms in thinking that Howard had her car towed costing her $200. Bernadette coyly asks \"Oh, no. Where was it parked? Was it in Howard's spot?\" She proudly announces that she had Amy's car towed and that Amy probably didn't see that one coming. Amy swings her purse at Bernadette who ducks. The bag hits Penny in the face, and unfortunately, Amy has a coffee can full of change that she had been meaning to take to the bank. They continue to argue as they have to take Penny to the emergency room.Sheldon moves his chair and whiteboard out to the parking spot and tells the approaching Howard that since he said that he wasn't using his space, he decided to actually use it. Sheldon taunts him saying that he is tangling with a superior intellect that he can't do anything about. Howard then honks his horn for a long time. Sheldon put on headphones and tells Howard there is his threats are empty and there is nothing he can do to move him. Howard then pushes Sheldon with his car in his chair so he can park his car. Leonard comes running out asking what is going on. Sheldon tells him that Howard tried to kill him. Leonard tells them that they are both acting like idiots over a stupid parking spot. Leonard can't believe that Howard tried to run Sheldon over. Howard asks him how often has he wanted to do that to Sheldon. Sheldon then crawls into Howard's car and strips naked, breaking in the new car for him with extra butt-wiggling for emphasis.Finally, Raj drags Howard in to see Sheldon to apologize and give him back the space. Sheldon replies thank you and that he was a big man to do that, but Sheldon finds that unacceptable. He should be the bigger man and loans him the space until Sheldon learns to drive or gets a Batmobile. He also has Howard say, at Raj's insistence, that Sheldon is the bigger man. He also returns his Iron Man helmet which Sheldon found that he couldn't wear to a bank because they will tackle you to the ground.Later, Amy, Bernadette, Howard, and Sheldon get together at the Cheesecake Factory telling each other that they feel closer because of their experience. Penny, who has a broken nose and is visibly bruised about the face, passes by and sarcastically says, \"Yeah, everybody's happy. Great!\"Finally, Sheldon takes his sofa cushion to the dry cleaner's to remove anything that Howard had left on it. He also tries to sell his laptop for the dry cleaner's teenage son.Title reference: The fight between Sheldon and Howard when Sheldon's parking space is reassigned to Howard.", "episode_23": "Amy, Penny, and Bernadette hop into a cab as Penny shouts \"Vegas here we come!\" Bernadette adds, \"No husbands, no boyfriends, no rules!\" Amy then asks if they are going to get drunk and have a six way with the Blue Man Group. Penny says no, so Amy concludes that there must be some rules.\nThe guys are having an \"anything can happen\" night playing Dungeons and Dragons without their women. Penny has a new bikini, Bernadette has a sexy tube top and a can of pepper spray, and Amy plans on throwing some of her old underwear on stage at the Garth Brooks concertSheldon has a new set of dice, Leonard has a new inhaler in case things get too exciting, and Raj has a brand new playing piece. The girls are chanting \"Vegas! Vegas! Vegas!\" while the guys are similarly chanting \"The Dungeon of Mofooskay-Heeko!\"Raj is \"hanging with his bros\" because Lucy is busy. Sheldon is not comfortable with Howard as dungeon master. Leonard tells him that change is good. Howard starts his game narration doing a Nicholas Cage impression. Sheldon then tells Leonard that Howard is a much better dungeon master than he is. Raj gets a text from Lucy that she is free, so his character commits suicide and Raj leaves.Raj, who is drinking, tells Lucy that he is glad they could hang out. Lucy says She is still trying to do more things that scare her like telling her hair dresser that she doesn't like bangs. Raj asks what else she is working on and Lucy says that it is a tie between sending food back a restaurant and saying no to door-to-door magazine salesmen. She now has a two-year subscription to \"Guns and Ammo\".The D&D game continues with Howard doing sound effects that Sheldon thinks are better than Leonard's attempts. The door opens with Penny announcing \"Guess who?\" Howard is confused about why they're already back. It turns out that Amy had been taken out of line by a TSA agent for a pat down which Amy thought got a little \"handsy\" and Amy broke the TSA agent's nose with her elbow. Now, she is on the national \"no-fly\" list.\nPenny says \"You lost money, you feel shame, and you got groped. That's Vegas. You nailed it.\" Leonard suggests that they all join them, Sheldon asks him if he has a drug problem. They've never played D&D with girls before. Penny quips that no one ever has. Sheldon leaves it up to Howard, the dungeon master, who has Al Pacino telling them that the whole apartment is going to play.Penny makes drinks which Sheldon objects to because they don't have alcohol during their Dungeons and Dragons game since it impairs their judgment. Penny claimed that she is serving a magic potion that makes her like him. While facing down a couple of ogres, Penny starts rolling the dice Vegas style. She kills the ogre and pleads that they play for money.Having dinner together, Lucy says that her crab cakes taste a little funky. Raj pushes her to send back her crab cakes back and calls over the waiter. This act spooks her and she leaves to go to use the bathroom. Lucy repeats her escape and finds herself trapped in a fenced in area. Lucy calls Raj and tells him that she has a funny story.Back in the apartment, everyone rolls the dice as if they are in Las Vegas. Amy rolls and then takes out the next ogre. She screams that this fun is better than Vegas, but Penny disagrees.Raj finds Lucy trapped behind the fence. She says \"Long time, no see.\" Then she tells him that he pushed her too much making her send back her food. Raj says that the fact that she has more emotional problems than him make her very attractive. He says that he thinks she is wonderful and they kiss through the chain linked fence.Howard describes the dragon falling into a volcano and then emerging to attack. Sheldon insists that Howard do another impression so Howard does Christopher Walken. Penny then suggests that since they (Sheldon & Amy) won't be doing it (having sex) anytime soon, Sheldon and Amy's game pieces should \"do it\" in the game. Both Sheldon and Amy are visibly uncomfortable with this topic, but Bernadette and Howard continue to make an annoying cooing noise, and Bernadette casts a love spell on Sheldon and Amy. Howard describes Amy as half-orc with four hairy breasts. Howard asks what Amy is going to do. She gets upset, leaves and goes onto Sheldon's bedroom. Sheldon angrily complains that this is why girls don't play Dungeons and Dragons.Sheldon joins her in his bedroom since everyone else sent him in. Amy explains to him that their friends think that their relationship is a joke. Sheldon doesn't think that way and tells her a real joke. Amy asks Sheldon if they are ever going to have an intimate relationship. Sheldon replies he never thought about intimacy with anyone before he met Amy. Amy asks how he feels about it now. Sheldon does not rule it out.\nSheldon tells her to wait and then gets some dice so that they can finish the spell that was put on their D&D characters. He tells her that as their friends pillage the dragon corpse, he takes her to a secluded area and removes her armor. Then they kiss on the lips and Amy removes his armor. Sheldon then erotically caresses her nose which causes Amy to tell him to keep rolling the dice.Leonard and Penny try to apologize to them and Amy sends them away. They hear Amy saying that Sheldon nibbles \"my...fourteen. Yes!!\"Title reference: The love spell put upon Sheldon and Amy's characters in their Dungeons and Dragons game.", "episode_18": "At apartment 4A, Leonard explains, as part of their contract with the university, he, Sheldon, and Howard are required to serve on a committee that promotes science among young women. Howard complains that if he could have persuaded women to do things, he wouldn't have spent so much time in the shower. Leonard asks Sheldon he doesn't think there should be more women in science and Sheldon tells him that he believes in a gender-blind society, like Star Trek.\nLeonard describes Star Trek as a society where they invented interstellar warp drive, but a African-American still answered the space phone. Sheldon's real objection is to be required to do \"banal committee work\" which is like the Fantastic 4's Human Torch being asked to heat up a frozen burrito.\nLeonard suggests that all student papers be submitted with just the student's first initial so that they are not judged by gender. Sheldon gives examples like Harry Potter's author and Star Trek script writer D.C. Fontana. Howard adds exotic dancer \"D.D. Melons\".\nLeonard asks them to think about the topic and also play a sexist game which has female characters with huge mammary glands. Sheldon explains that his character can use an battle ax as well as any man and Howard comments on how much milk his character could provide the world. Sheldon feels that the problem shouldn't be addressed at the university level because it is too late. They should start at the middle school level to set women on the road to the hard science.\nLeonard wants to give the idea a trial run. Howard proposes that they go to his old middle school to talk to some of the female students.At Penny's, Raj thanks the ladies for again letting him crash girls' night. Raj is seeking advice on a killer first date with Lucy. Amy says that evolutionary biology shows that women like men that are steady in the face of danger and suggests an unsafe environment like a seedy bar on the \"wrong side of the tracks\", a picnic near a lunatic asylum, or a wine tasting on skid row.\nBernadette suggests Disneyland's Space Mountain ride where you can hold hands in the dark. Penny adds that you have to remember that the ride is real short and they take your picture at the end so you have to get all your clothes back on before it's over. Again she says that she is making a joke...based on real events.\nAmy hasn't been there since she was a kid and suggests that they go some weekend. Bernadette thinks it's too crowded on weekends so Penny suggests that they blow off work one weekday. Penny says that it's more like ending up in a Best Western motel with a 34-year-old guy named Luther. Bernadette asks her if that's another joke and Penny tells her that she can laugh about it now. The girls then decide to go to Disneyland themselves on Friday. Amy asks if they want to do California Adventure too.Walking down the halls of Howard's old middle school, Leonard says that it was nice of Howard's old school letting them try out their science topic on some of their students. Howard then reminds them that the last time he was here he was just a \"scrawny little nerd\". Howard finds his old locker and still wonders, even though he has a master's degree in engineering, how a bully got him and his briefcase into his locker. Then, a taller student walks by and bumps into him and doesn't say he is sorry. Howard starts to say something to the student, but then stops.The girls are on their way to Disneyland. Amy says she can't believe they are ditching work for Disneyland. Amy goes into a long explanation of how she kept calling her boss as she went through the day before, leading him through a story about her food poisoning. Penny says she just works at the Cheesecake Factory and told them \"bye\". Bernadette wants to head straight to where they make you up to look like a Disney princess. Penny wants to get drunk and ride the rides. They all want to be Cinderella, but Bernadette says that since it was her idea and she's driving she gets to be her or they can all walk home if they don't like it.Raj is setting a table at library with dining paraphernalia for his date with Lucy and a man sits down at the table. Raj tells him that he is getting ready for a date because he and his date are both uncomfortable in social situations. The guy says that he also has that problem and asks if he can join them. Raj says no and tells the big man to climb back up whatever beanstalk he came down. Lucy comes in and the big guy tells her that she can do better. Lucy asks if they are eating there and Raj texts her that they are having a \"texting date\". She replies that she likes the idea. He also tells her to remember that he has an adorable accent.In a room full of bored and disinterested middle school girls, Leonard asks them (in a wannabe rapper voice), \"Who's ready for some science??\" He introduces everyone and tells the girls that they are going to learn how cool science can be-as cool as -273 degrees, which is the temperature that entropy reaches its minimum value (absolute zero). Sheldon is next and he calls them \"female children\" and tells them they are about to be inspired by the story of female scientist Madame Curie who died from radiation poisoning due to her discovery and work with radium. With a little hard work, Sheldon tells them, the same thing can happen to any of them.\nHoward tells them that they too can go into outer space. One student wants to know if he went to the moon. Howard says no but he has been to the International Space Station. Then she asks if he flew the rocket, and Howard admits that he just rode inside the rocket.\nLeonard now takes over and explains that he is an experimental physicist. He tests theories and gets to work with lasers. A student wants to know how he decided to become a scientist. Leonard mentions that both Hofstadter's parents were scientists and that they pushed him. He really wanted to be a rap star like Snoop Dogg, but with more respect for the police, which gets a laugh from the students.Back at the library, Raj and Lucy are having a good \"text date\", laughing at each other's comments. Lucy tells him that she does web design for porn sites. Surprised, Raj denies even knowing what they are. Lucy tries to cover up her mistake by claiming she typed the wrong word due to an auto-correct error, she says she really works on prom sites. Raj texts back he really likes proms. He texts that it was auto-correct and that it should be that he likes sports.At the middle school, Leonard rants on about having to learn to play the cello when he was younger. Sheldon tells them that it might be better if they hear something from two actual female scientists, Bernadette and Amy. Sheldon thanks them for taking time out of their busy schedule even though they are at Disneyland dressed as Disney princesses. Bernadette is Cinderella, Penny is Aurora from \"Sleeping Beauty\", and Amy is Snow White. They tell the students that the world needs more women scientists though as they grow up the world is more focused on how they look instead of the power of their minds. Amy at this moment touches up her lipstick. Bernadette says that they can be anything they want.Lucy and Raj finish their date when her phone battery runs out. She says she had fun and that this date definitely pushed her comfort envelope. Lucy flees with an excuse of having a panic attack when she tries to kiss Raj. Raj says he is still counting the experience foreplay.Howard returns home and Bernadette calls out that she has a surprise for him. Howard hopes that she is Cinderella. Upon seeing her he removes his shirt and trots over as Prince Charming on a horse. Leonard gets to Penny's apartment, sees her dressed up, and says \"What?\" as Penny tries to explain enthusiastically about ditching work and going to Disneyland and he begins to tear his clothes off. In Sheldon's apartment, Amy is lying down on the couch and calls Sheldon over from the computer to kiss Snow White and wake her up, but Sheldon declines, saying he heard her the first time.Title reference: Leonard, Sheldon and Howard's obligations in their contracts to help promote science, in this case, to middle school girls.", "episode_8": "Sheldon mentions one day in the cafeteria that he could, in theory, build a containment field to open a wormhole to another dimension the size of a Frisbee. When Sheldon leaves, he hands the napkin, on which he has been doodling some thought on a wormhole generator, to Howard. Howard wants to know if he wants to build it. Sheldon says that he wants him to wipe his chin; he has food on it. After Sheldon leaves, Howard notices that Sheldon's pristine schedule has a lapse of 20 minutes every afternoon where no one knows where he goes or what he does. Raj guesses that he heads to the men's room, while Leonard corrects him since that is not on Sheldon's pristine schedule. Raj and Howard corner him in the hallway by his office, and Sheldon denies that anything is unusual. They then ask his assistant Alex, and she reveals that even she doesn't know where he goes.Later, Penny and Leonard are hanging out in her apartment. Penny is texting a fellow English student named Cole (Ryan Cartwright), who's working with her on an oral class project. Jealous, Leonard asks if he and Penny are still dating and is convinced that Cole is flirting with Penny, but Penny denies it and says that he's just being nice.Leonard begins chatting with Alex in the Cafeteria about it, and she mentions that it is probably nothing. She then coyly adds that Leonard might even be flirted with without really knowing it. She almost admits that she is purposely flirting with him. He the walks out with his coffee laughing hysterically while Alex looks disappointed.Elsewhere at Caltech, Raj and Howard follow Sheldon down to an old storage room in the basement. Unable to hear what he's doing, Howard and Raj break in later that night and find an almost empty room with a blackboard that has the number 43 written on it. Given Sheldon's apparent obsession with order and numbers, Raj and Howard spend all night trying to figure out what the significance of the number 43 is. Howard's mom has 43 inches of neck fat.Later, when Cole comes over to Penny's to work on the project, Leonard spies on him from his apartment. Leonard follows him down the stairs and tells him to watch out for \"Penny's boyfriend\", saying that he was a gang member. When Cole says that Penny told him that her boyfriend was a scientist, Leonard makes the excuse that \"The Scientists\" was the name of his gang. Penny witnessed his stunt.Penny is very upset with Leonard, and the two later meet in the hallway and have an argument. Penny tells him that she cannot believe that he cannot trust her and that he embarrassed her in front of Cole. who knew who he was since his picture is on her refrigerator. Penny continues to tell him that he is the one she is with and accidentally mentions that he knows that she loves him. Leonard is stunned and tells her that that is the first she ever said that. Penny rushes off to work to avoid crying in front of him, also allowing Leonard to run off and cry, too. Leonard walks into his apartment sniffling and says to himself that she loves me. Next he gets a text from Alex, inviting him for coffee sometime, and Leonard smiles, mentioning that she is such a friendly girl.Unable to solve what 43 means, Howard installs a spare camera from the Mars rover project so they can spy on Sheldon in the storage room. The next day, Howard and Raj watch the video feed and are stunned when they see Sheldon use an unknown machine to create a small wormhole in the room. Sheldon mentions aloud into a recorder that he hasn't found life in 43 parallel universes, and thrusts his head through the wormhole. Sheldon backs out, screaming as a reptilian creature eats his face. Raj and Howard scream as Sheldon's prop for the creature is dropped on their laptop from behind them and they scream again. Sheldon had found the camera and created a phony video to cover up what he was really doing. Sheldon explains that what he did with his spare time was none of their business, but was centered around giving his mind a break from his struggles with understanding social behavior and the mental bombardment caused by his work. Later, Sheldon is seen in the storeroom playing with a Hacky Sack, telling himself that he'll never reach 43 consecutive hits again.Title reference: The number that Howard and Raj found on Sheldon's blackboard in the basement.", "episode_11": "Leonard is assembling a cardboard fireplace decoration for his apartment. He is amazed that he assembled an entire fireplace with his own bare hands, even though he did get a paper-cut. Leonard tells Penny that the guys are playing Dungeons and Dragons together.\nAmy tells Sheldon that she always wanted to play Dungeons and Dragons. Sheldon replies that she isn't invited because men at times have to get away from civility and break out into their primal selves.Bernadette tells Howard that she worked late so that they could be together on Saturday night. Howard tells her that if he doesn't come, then the guys will blame the failure of their night on her. Raj and Stuart had planned to have dinner and see the Christmas lights in Griffith Park, but are even more excited about joining in the game.Their Dungeons and Dragons quest starts with a Christmas gift given to Sheldon who, as usual, is complaining about Christmas, like the overuse of \"t'is\" and \"t'was\". He pulls out a scroll from the Christmas stocking that describes their quest that starts in a village of massacred elves. They must rescue their leader Santa Claus from a pack of ogres. In-game, Howard finds a secret door, tries to set up an invasion strategy; however, Raj rushes in. He hits a tripwire that triggers a cannon, leading to his death and disqualification.Penny pokes her head into the room and tells the guys that she thought that they should see what they are missing out on. Acting like runway model fashion models, Bernadette shows off a tight short red dress from \"Forever 21\" and Amy a flowered dress from \"Forever 63\", actually showing a lot of ankle. Penny is wearing a very short little black dress that got her out of two speeding tickets and jury duty. Raj says he wants to go, but first the girls tell him that he can't come because its girls' night but, after the girls leave, Penny pokes her head back in and invites him.At the nightclub bar, Bernadette wants to find a girl for Raj but needs to know whether he should find a girl to get laid, casual hook-up with or a quality relationship. Amy announces that they should get him laid. The girls tell him that they could find someone and introduce him. Raj doesn't want the girl to know that he has money, but she has to be a nine or ten. Or eight if she brings another eight to the hot tub.Back at the game, the boys' characters find a large chest. Howard wants to bury his head (i.e. boobs) in it even though he is married. The door locks behind them, and glowing words appear on the chest as the walls start to close in. The answer of the clues has Sheldon singing \"Good King Wenceslas\" to stop the walls from closing in. Sheldon knows the song from when his grandparents would sing carols at Christmas time.At the nightclub, Raj finds a hot girl at the bar, they talked for a while, and he leaves her to return to the girls. He finds that she gave him a phony email address. He did when he fell for his friends' hot girlfriends, Penny and Bernadette. Amy then concludes at some point he'll fall for her. Raj says a definite \"no\", but Penny and Bernadette urgently try to get Raj to change his comment about Amy, but he keeps saying \"no\", and that he wouldn't fall for her.Back at the apartment, Sheldon finishes the last verse of \"Good King Wenceslas\". Next, they find a pool of melted snowmen that Sheldon wants every detail about. Leonard wishes Sheldon would get in the spirit since he had enough crappy Christmases when he was a kid. Instead of leaving Santa milk and cookies, Leonard's family left research papers for Santa, and then in the morning they were graded. Sheldon, being Sheldon thinks they must have been great Christmases.At the nightclub, Raj apologizes to Amy if he upset her. Amy says her first kiss was at 22, but only before she returned some guy's medicine to him. Raj claims that during a game of spin the bottle, the girl the bottle landed on said if he came close to her she would break the bottle and cut him. Amy says she fell asleep at a fraternity party in college and woke up with more clothes on. Raj says that he would sit on one hand, make it numb, and then hold hands and feel like it was another person. Amy says she does the same thing, but hers sometimes would cup her breast. Amy tells Raj that she knows what it's like to be alone and Raj agrees as they seem to connect.\nAmy then says \"Raj wants me; now I'm good\". She says that they can leave now, obviously getting back at Raj who then tells Penny on the way out that now he may fall for Amy.During the next game stunt, Sheldon puts the answer to a puzzle on the whiteboard and the three other players use the solution that has them playing \"Jingle Bells\" with bells. This act lowers the drawbridge and they find the bloody and beaten Santa in the dungeon. Sheldon casts a spell of paralysis on Howard and Stuart, goes in and yells at Santa. Sheldon confesses that when, he was five, he asked Santa to bring back his Pop-Pop, Meemaw's husband, who had just died and was his only relative that urged him to follow his dream into science. Instead Santa brought him a set of Lincoln Logs. Sheldon kicks Santa and leaves him to the ogres. The others are completely shocked as they now know that Sheldon doesn't like celebrating Christmas as he was struggling to recover from such a traumatic family tragedy at the time.That night, Sheldon comes into the living room and finds Santa Claus leaving him presents and he apologizes for not bringing back his Pop-Pop because he says that his magical power is limited. He also has something special for Sheldon, who seems excited, thinking his presents are trains. But because Sheldon left him for dead in the game, Santa fires a cannon at Sheldon for his revenge. Sheldon quickly wakes up from his nightmare.Title reference: The Dungeons & Dragons Santa Claus story-line.", "episode_1": "On comic book night, the gang is talking about Howard (Simon Helberg) on the International Space Station.

Afterward, Amy asks about Leonard and Penny, Penny (Kaley Cuoco) tells her that it is still seems weird ever since Leonard (Johnny Galecki) marriage proposal to her during sex. Amy replied that if Sheldon did that her ovaries would grab onto him and never let go.At the Caltech cafeteria, Raj (Kunal Nayyar) complains how lonely he is, so Sheldon invites him out on his date with Amy. Sheldon says that he is responsible for conversation and romantic actions and that the Relationship Agreement says nothing about outsourcing it out to an Indian.Amy is upset when she sees Raj waiting for them. He tries to get Amy to talk about herself so they can get to know each other better, and she tells him to go away. Raj orders champagne when he finds out that it's their second anniversary. Raj is thrown out by Amy.\nAfter drinking, Amy mentions that Sheldon looks like a sexy praying mantis because they devour their mates and, after she unbuttons the top of her blouse, she says that dessert is served. After Sheldon says that he has already had cobbler, she says that she is done with him ignoring her and gets up to leave. He replies that she can't leave because he needs her. \"You do?\" she asks hopefully, but it was only because she was his ride. Amy tells him that if he doesn't say something meaningful and from the heart, that she is breaking up and leaving him. Then he speaks romantically to her about when he sees her he gets stronger and weaker, excited and terrified, and that he doesn't know how he feels. She is touched until he explains that it came from the first Spider-Man movie. Reluctantly, she says that she'll \"take it\".Leonard puts together an evening to hang out with Penny which includes her favorite refreshments and watching her choice of football or baseball on television. She appreciates it because she has had a hard day. Unfortunately, Leonard tries to get her to talk about their relationship, which doesn't please her.

His death opens a tenured position in the Physics Department. Sheldon is not happy with the tenure system since it leads to the faculty becoming complacent. He prefers placing chips in their heads that causes the brain to explode if they say something stupid. Barry leaves saying that if they need him, they can find his nose firmly lodged up the rectum of the tenure committee. Raj says that he's not going to play politics and that he hopes that if he doesn't get it, Sheldon or Leonard get it.While having dinner together, Penny learns that a professor in a tenured position can't be fired no matter how bad he or she is. She quips that it's like being a pretty waitress at The Cheesecake Factory. Penny asks who he has to impress while Leonard states that he'll let his work speak for itself. Penny compliments him on his integrity. Leonard reacts saying that he is a naive idiot to do that and she replies that he did hear what she was really saying.While Amy and Sheldon are having dinner, he tells her that even if he were tenured, it would not decrease his academic output since like himself, one can't turn off the sun. Sheldon is worried if he got tenure Leonard would become insanely jealous and he would have to have a gun or a chainsaw under his pillow at night. Amy counters that with his extra income he could move out, buy a house, get married start a family. Amy tells him that maybe he should cozy up to the tenure committee. Checking up on the tenure committee, Sheldon finds that Janine Davis (Regina King) is on it.Leonard goes to the gymnasium exercise room to get close to Mrs. Davis. Asking how to operate the model of exercise equipment, Mrs. Davis tells him to push the \"start\" button. Nothing happens since Leonard doesn't know to start walking. He then asks Mrs. Davis about being on the tenure committee who then comments that she has to get a home gym. While Leonard continues quickly using his inhaler, Barry comes in noting that it's the first time he's ever seen Leonard in the gym. Barry takes his place on the other side of Mrs. Davis and mentions the banana bread he sent to her. Leonard says that he now has had enough cardio and decides to stretch out before he does his weights and ends up exhausted lying on the gym floor.Having returned to her office, Mrs. Davis receives a ninety-minute YouTube video from Raj detailing his life and qualifications. She turns it off hearing Sheldon's usual knock. (God, they're everywhere!) Sheldon tells her that she might have had a bad impression from their first meeting so he gives Mrs. Davis a gift, a DVD set of the miniseries Roots, so that she will like him. She then asks him why he thought that he had an appropriate gift. Sheldon asks to verify that she is black. The next committee member he is visiting is Dr. Wu whom he got the inappropriate gift of the complete DVD collected works of Jackie Chan.Leonard returns from the nurse's office after an asthma or heart attack\\ Howard, who is not in line for the tenured position, kids them that they don't want to look like they're brown nosing the committee who will all be at prof Tupperman's funeral.Sheldon and Amy are in the apartment having tea as he tells her that he can't make their date night since he has to attend the memorial service. Amy suggests that she come to which Sheldon agrees. Amy says that she is well versed in academic politics and is a respected scientist while Sheldon just wants her to drive him.While Leonard and Penny are preparing dinner, Penny mentions that she was helping Amy to choose a dress for the memorial service which surprises Leonard. He didn't want them to find out that he was going by himself. Penny asks if she should go to support him. Penny leans over to tie her shoelace showing off her butt to which Leonard says that maybe she should go.\nRaj is on the phone still arguing with his father about his seat warmer (for his new BMW which is being denied) and telling his Yorkie that he has to get tenure.Amy and Sheldon arrive with her coaching him what not to say. Raj walks in with a drink in hand telling them that it is unbelievable that they came to suck up to the committee. Leonard and Penny show up with Leonard snapping at Sheldon that the train store wasn't having a cotillion after all. Amy asks what Penny is doing there to which she says she is there to support her man, just like Amy. Sheldon assumes that Penny is there to take their drink orders and get them wrong. Leonard tells her to \"do it\". Penny whips off her coat and is wearing a tight black dress and a push-up bra.Raj is staring at Penny's prominent cleavage. Sheldon asks Amy if she has done \"it\" yet. Amy tells him that she plans to flirt with the committee members to further Leonard's cause. Sheldon tells Amy, \"Don't just stand there, take your breasts out!\" Howard and Bernadette show up to watch the fun.\nHoward makes a suggestion to Sheldon who then tells Raj that last night when he needed sexual relief, he had his mother for a dollar. Leonard concedes that he doesn't want to lose his friends over a job because friends are forever. Howard jumps in that so is tenure (forever).\nKripke enters telling Mrs. Davis that he'd love to babysit her kids. Leonard says that they are not going to lose to that jerk. The others also go into the hall.Finally, Sheldon goes to Mrs. Davis' office and thanks her after he finds out that he, Leonard, and Raj are all on the final short list. She replies that they are all qualified in their fields, including Sheldon despite his quirks. First Sheldon acknowledges that his gift to her was inappropriate and then tries to give her a hip African American hand shake.Title reference: The new tenured position that opens causes turbulence among Leonard, Sheldon, and Raj who are all potential candidates for it.", "episode_13": "Sheldon and Leonard are preparing for their trip to the Bakersfield Comic-con and plan on wearing their Star Trek: The Next Generation costumes. Penny mentions that Leonard has more and better makeup than she does. Sheldon says he once borrowed his sister's makeup and got a terrible case of pink eye, but the up side was that he was dressing as a zombie and the added effect helped him win second place. Penny remarks that they just went to the San Diego Comic-Con, and Leonard replies that the Bakersfield one is smaller and more about the comic books, which was what the San Diego one was like before it \"went all Hollywood.\"The girls are enjoying a Saturday brunch since they are all alone. Leonard texts Penny that they are heading to Bakersfield at warp speed. Penny wonders how these super-smart guys who work at a major university can get so excited about something made for twelve-year-old people. Amy thinks that since they were bullied when they were kids in a world where you can't fight back, superheroes provide meaningful wish fulfillment. The girls realize that none of them have ever read a comic book and that maybe they should look into it since it is such an important part of their guys' lives. Bernadette tells them that the comic book store is nearby and Penny exclaims that that is an amazing idea, then wonders how many mimosas she has had.On their trip, Sheldon keeps insisting that they enable the turn-by-turn voice option on the GPS. When Leonard finally gives in and turns it on, they discover that Sheldon has downloaded his voice and \"fun\" trip facts into the GPS software. Raj then suggests they stop at Vasquez Rocks, the filming location of several Star Trek episodes, and take some action photos in costume.Visiting the comic book store, the girls get stared at by all the male customers. Penny tells Stuart that they were wondering why the guys liked comic books so much and wanted to give them a try. Stuart asks what kind they wanted--superhero, graphic novel, fantasy, manga. When Amy asks who the best superhero is, Stuart tells her to keep quiet or she could start a rumble. Penny asks what he recommends, and he explains that you have your good guy superheroes like Superman and Spider-Man, or your darker anti-heroes like Batman and Wolverine. Stuart recommends Fables due to its excellent artwork, sophisticated stories, and the fact that it doesn't objectify women, while Penny thinks that Thor looks hot, to which Stuart agrees.The guys are finished with their costumes: Sheldon is Data, Leonard is Jean-Luc Picard, Howard is a Borg drone, and Raj is Worf. First they pose in a fight scene, with Sheldon looking thoughtful because \"Data's weapon is his mind.\" They then draw their phasers on Howard-as-a-Borg and take some Charlie's Angels and glamour shots, all with Sheldon holding his thoughtful pose. Suddenly, Leonard's car is stolen due to the key being left in it, along with their regular clothes and cell phones. Leonard tells them that they should head off and find a gas station or something. Sheldon asks if he was taking charge just because he had on the Captain's uniform. When Leonard says yes, Sheldon agrees.Back at Penny's apartment, Bernadette and Amy are waiting for Penny to finish her comic book. They wonder how the guys can get caught up for hours discussing something that doesn't even exist. Penny scoffs at Thor's hammer being so heavy that no one else can pick it up; Bernadette says that it's some kind of magic from Thor, while Amy counters that Thor is a god, it's his hammer, therefore only he can use it (like Sheldon and his toothbrush or his \"thin, beckoning lips\"). Wondering if they missed something, they go back to their comics.Walking through the desert, everyone is complaining. Sheldon tells them to stop it because they are Starfleet officers. He reminds them that it's like they are living a Star Trek fantasy as a landing party lost on an alien world, relying only on their wits... a scenario that lasts until a passing car throws an Icee-like drink at Sheldon. After a long walk, they arrive at a diner and ask the waitress for some water and to borrow a telephone to call the police. The waitress asks why they don't just have Scotty beam them up, and as she and the patrons laugh, Sheldon corrects her, telling her that they are Next Generation characters, not Original Series.Meanwhile, the girls continue arguing about Thor's hammer and who can pick it up. They decide to go over to Leonard and Sheldon's apartment and go through the guys' comics to learn more about the hammer.Back at the diner, a policeman takes a stolen vehicle report about the car, clothes, makeup, and cell phones, then asks if he can call someone, like their mothers. Right on cue, Howard enters and tells them that his mother has gotten them a rental car. The guys decide to return home. Raj reluctantly gives in, but insists that they at least rent their car from Enterprise.The girls are now sitting in the living room, eating Chinese food and arguing over comic books, just like their guys (Penny and Amy are even sitting in Leonard and Sheldon's traditional spots on the couch). They have morphed into their own significant others. Bernadette proposes that if Thor picked up the hammer and The Hulk picked up Thor, then by the transitive rule of picking things up, Hulk has picked up the hammer. Penny counters that if she picks up a guy in a bar who then picks up a girl and they all leave together, does that mean that she picked up the girl?\nAs the tired Star Trek enthusiasts return, they hear their ladies arguing and Sheldon wonders if they have somehow \"tumbled into an alternate universe where the girls appreciate great literature.\" He figures that if they are in a different reality, a Star Trek landing party should investigate. Thinking that they might be hostile, they pull out their phasers, but before charging through the door, Leonard orders them to set the phasers on stun (because if they vaporize them, he'll never find another girlfriend as pretty as Penny).In the final scene, the car thieves are seen driving Leonard's car on the interstate highway while listening to Sheldon's modified GPS. Unlike the guys, however, the two find the facts interesting and the quizzes fun.Title reference: The men's journey to the Bakersfield Comic Con.", "episode_17": "Raj and Lucy, the girl who left with him after the Valentine's Day party at the comic book store, are having coffee the same evening. Raj tells her how he went to Cambridge University, which reminded him of Hogwarts, where he fell in love with astronomy. He then asks about her, but first she excuses herself to go to the restroom. Raj thinks that everything is going great until we see Lucy passing the front window.The next day, Sheldon is taping a Fun with Flags episode in his apartment. He apologizes to the audience for not airing an episode last week because Leonard pointed out that when he dressed up as George Washington Carver for Black History Month that that show was racist. Penny is Sheldon's guest and is described as a flag virgin. Penny joins him and says that she has many times been at parties and has not been able to join in the discussions about flags. Penny stops the taping and shows him how to loosen up using things she learned in acting class like talking to his guest and not to the camera. Also he should have his arms opened instead of crossed thus welcoming everybody in. Sheldon then looks too relaxed almost like Penny and he are a couple. Penny then says that she is from Nebraska so Sheldon shows her and describes the Nebraska state flag now sitting stiffly.Howard, Bernadette, and Leonard go to visit Raj after not hearing from him for a few days. Howard says that he can always feel when Raj is in trouble. They get him to open the door after he complains that nothing good ever happens to him. Inside they find Raj moping over Lucy looking terrible and his apartment is a wreck. Raj tells them that he was humiliated by yet another woman. Raj explains that he took her to get coffee and that she left. She had climbed out a very tiny window in the bathroom meaning that she was highly motivated to leave.\nRaj tells them to leave him alone and goes into the bedroom. Before they leave Bernadette says they could talk about it over lobster, saying only she had the decency to wait on her lobster craving until he left the room.Sheldon is video chatting with Amy who is monitoring her cigarette-addicted monkeys who are now going through withdrawal and are getting on her nerves. He tells her that his \"Fun with Flags\" episode went well and that Penny's acting tips were very helpful. He demonstrates opening his arms and saying \"Welcome to my world\" and subsequently folding his arms and saying \"Not welcome to my world\". Amy asks if he told Penny that she was helpful and had done a nice job. Amy says that she is his friend and that he should.Penny walks out her door with the trash not giving Sheldon a chance to knock. She asks if she should close the door until after he does his knock, but Sheldon says that he's fine since he had not started. He then tells Penny that he was thinking about her performance and thanked her for the great job she did. His comments included using her name three times, each time with three taps on the door completing his knocking sequence. Penny then invites Amy and him to her acting class play on Friday night. Sheldon walks away and says that he is not interested in that.\nBack at his computer, Amy is seen teasing her monkeys by not giving them their cigarette lighter. Sheldon tells Amy about the play and Amy tells him that he was rude not accepting the offer since she had helped him out. Sheldon complains about all the crazy rules as the monkeys start to throw their feces at Amy. Back at Penny's door, at first Penny doesn't want him to come under obligation. Then they argue about how he \"wants to go because he has to want to go\".At the comic book store, Sheldon mentions how he hasn't seen Raj lately and if he is now out of their social group. Howard tells Sheldon that Raj has decided to never leave his apartment again. Sheldon thinks that that idea is brilliant and wishes he could do it. Lucy enters the comic book store and approaches Stuart. She asks if he remembers her, and Stuart mentions that she left the party with Raj, which gets the guys' attention. Howard tells her that he is Raj's best friend and that Raj is devastated. Lucy says that she is sorry and asks Howard to give Raj a note. Howard replies that Raj is a proud man and that if she walks out again, she is only going to have five or six more chances.Howard is sitting in Raj's apartment and he is now dressed in only Tighty-Whities underpants and a plastic bib eating lobster. Howard shows Raj the note, and tells him that he should celebrate and call her. Raj doesn't want to call her and replies that he is going to be a monk, and renounce all his worldly pleasures except eating lobster. Howard leaves with Lucy's note. After Howard leaves, Raj runs down the street in his underwear and boots to get the phone number back from Howard.Leonard is getting ready to go to Penny's play and asks Amy how her monkey addiction project is going. Sadly, she is no longer associated with that project since she was flinging their feces back at them and was called unprofessional. Sheldon enters the living area reluctant to go to the \"stupid\" play. First Leonard takes away from Sheldon several gaming systems (a Nintendo DS, a Nintendo 3DS, a PSP, a Nintendo Game Boy), a Rubik's Cube and an Etch-A-Sketch. When Sheldon finally hears the play's name, A Streetcar Named Desire, he gets excited because he thinks it will be about actual streetcars.Lucy hesitantly walks up to Raj's door and knocks. Raj and his place have been cleaned up. Lucy says that she can't stay and that running out on him was not cool. Raj asks why she ran out on him. Lucy replies that she has a hard time around people she doesn't know. She had seen the flyer about the party and forced herself to come to get out of her comfort zone. Lucy doesn't even like comic books. Raj first agreed with her and then said that he did like them.\nRaj then admitted that he couldn't talk to her without his beer and that he has major psychological problems. Though Lucy thinks he might not be telling her the truth, she agrees to go on another date to find out.Penny is on a small stage performing as Blanche DuBois in \"A Streetcar Named Desire.\" Sheldon is wondering when the streetcars come in. Leonard is engrossed in Penny's performance and even Sheldon says that she is remarkable. Amy calls her friend a star.

Leonard tells him to clear off the system and erase his Alphas episodes. Sheldon replies that there is a season 2 cliffhanger so he wants to keep it until season 3 starts. Leonard lets him know that the show had been. He then declares that he's going to call the SyFy channel to complain. Sheldon feels that they are obligated to help the viewer let go.\nFirefly made a movie after it was canceled. Buffy the Vampire Slayer continued as a comic book. And Heroes slowly lowered the quality season by season until fans were grateful it ended.Howard is installing a security camera in Raj's apartment so he can watch his Yorkie at work. Raj then finds Lucy's blog which mentions she has met an Indian astrophysicist named Roger. Howard assures him that she just changed his name for privacy.After talking about all those TV shows, Leonard shows up at Penny's apartment wanting to introduce one of his favorite shows Buffy the Vampire Slayer. He says that the show has action, romance, hot guys and girls, something for both of them.Sheldon is on the phone claiming to be the SyFy vice president of programming telling them that they made a huge mistake in canceling Alphas. They recognize him from a previous phone call and hang up on him. Amy explains that he has a pathological need for closure. She can help him retrain his neural pathways to help him out. Amy knocks five times (Shave and a haircut), Sheldon finishes it with two knocks (Two bits) claiming that it proves nothing.Howard meets Raj in his office for lunch and Raj asks him if he is feminine. Raj did read Lucy's blog and she called him a little feminine. Howard then tells Raj to use what she said to his advantage to turn the tables on her and get her pants off.Leonard and Penny are watching the end of a Buffy episode. Leonard enthusiastically asks her how much she loved it and she calls it cute. He thinks that the word cute diminishes it, so she asks if she should stop calling his behind cute. She says that it was fun and reminds her of her own high school except instead of vampires, they had substance addicts. And both only came out at night with messed up teeth.Amy takes Sheldon through a series of OCD Exercises, where she won't let him finish things to help him with his compulsive need for closure. She tells him that they are in a world where closure is not always an op-----. Sheldon waits as she picks at her nails and then shouts \"tion\". She tells him that she plans to help reprogram his brain so that his need for closure is not so overwhelming. She starts by playing Tic-Tac-Toe with him and erases it before he can win.Penny and Bernadette finish watching an episode of Buffy and Penny asks her why Leonard likes it so much. She finds Leonard passionate about so many things; however, she doesn't feel that way. Bernadette has always been passionate about science ever since she saw little millions of micro-organisms swimming around through a microscope and she knew that she could wipe out their whole universe with her thumb.Raj Skypes with Howard just before Lucy comes over to his apartment. He needs to know if his hockey or his football jersey is manlier. Howard goes with the hockey jersey he is already wearing when Lucy knocks at the door. Raj answers with a manly \"Hey!\" She tells him how cute his Yorkie is; however, Raj claims that with the right command in German, she will rip her face off.In apartment 4A, Amy is playing the American national anthem and doesn't play the last note as Sheldon's nose twitches. Next Sheldon has hundreds of dominoes set up on the floor for toppling. Amy tells him but now he has to put them away.

Amy then has a birthday cake that she tells him to blow out the candles and covers one of them so he doesn't get his wish. He quietly says to himself that she is lucky because he wished that she was dead.Lucy and Raj are finishing dinner which she enjoyed. Raj mentions that he loves hockey, which Lucy does too. His dinner is still a bit frozen because he merely zapped it in the microwave and claimed to have not read the instructions since no wrapper tells him what to do, unless it's Jay-Z. Raj claims that it may be all the steroids he's been taking. Lucy excuses herself and tells him that she better go and thanks him for the pork rinds and the 20 min. monster truck lecture. Raj asks her to wait and that he found her blog which describes him as feminine. She replies that she meant that he is sweet, thoughtful, and has very nice caramel skin. Raj tells her that he is now fine.Penny and Leonard are having dinner as Penny is talking about how he is passionate about Buffy, science, and which TV remote to buy which gets Leonard off on his remote argument with Sheldon.

Stuart decides to organize a Halloween party at his comic book store, so Raj decides to become the party planner.Amy and Bernadette are attending ladies' night at the Cheesecake Factory bar. Leonard texts Penny about going out costume shopping. Penny confides in the girls that she's going to the comic book store Halloween party even though the guys that hang around there can be creepy.\nAmy and Bernadette then asks, like their better halves? Bernadette also says that Leonard does things that he doesn't like to make her happy and that maybe she should take more interest in his work. Penny says that that is true, but she doesn't understand what he does, and their explanations about experimental physics don't help, either.Later, Amy and Sheldon are discussing their Halloween costume ideas and Sheldon surprises Amy by agreeing to go in a couple's costume because that is one of the great advantages of being in a relationship. Amy wants to go as something like Romeo and Juliet; however, Sheldon's ideas for great costumes are R2-D2 and C-3PO or Hewlett and Packard. Amy is unmoved by his choices, and states that they should at least compromise.Penny visits Leonard's Lab and he shows her some of his \"high tech\" equipment, including a system that scans objects and generates rotating holograms. First there is a floating pencil, which changes into a rotating Earth and then a solar system followed by a galaxy. Penny remarks that she forgets how smart he really is, gets turned on, locks the door, and they start to fool around on the lab table after they take their jackets off.In the cafeteria, Raj is discussing his Halloween-themed party foods and Howard keeps talking about his time in space.\nHoward and Bernadette have just crawled into bed and things are starting to get romantic, but after six space metaphors, Bernadette stops to talk. She tells him that people are getting tired of hearing about it. Howard complains that he can't talk about the greatest adventure of his life, and she suggests that he wait until they bring it up.Penny is again visiting Leonard's lab as he demonstrates a floating iron ball levitated by a large magnetic force. Penny thinks it's very neat until Leonard mentions that sometimes he feels like Magneto from the X-Men. Penny replies now it seems less neat, until Leonard mentions he's wearing the black underwear she bought him. \"There ya go,\" she replies, and starts to kiss him again. In the cafeteria, Raj is getting a Doctor Who TARDIS police photo booth for the party which excites Sheldon, while Howard is being very quiet and noncommittal. He finds that Sheldon and Raj agree that he was talking too much about space.Amy and Sheldon, on Amy's proviso that the both of them should compromise, are still discussing their costumes. Sheldon suggests salt and pepper, but Amy has had a bad experience with both (one of her cousins having been killed in a pepper grinding plant accident and salt making her retain water). She claims that there are three things that say that she doesn't have a made-up boyfriend: couples costumes, Hickies, and sex tapes. She asks Sheldon to pick one, to which he asks what a hickey is.At Howard and Bernadette's Apartment, they are both dressed up as Smurfs. Howard isn't that excited to go since all his friends think he is boring. Bernadette asks if he is feeling blue, laughing that that's like the funniest thing she ever said. She then pushes him out the door since she just spent three hours painting herself blue and doesn't want people to think she is a very short alien from Avatar.At the Halloween party, Penny dresses as a sexy cop and Leonard goes as Albert Einstein. Bernadette mistakes her for a promiscuous cop, but Penny explains that that costume only came with a skirt and two badges. Leonard says (in a German accent) that later she was going to arrest him for traveling faster than the speed of light. Penny reminds him about their no-accent rule, to which he replies, \"Sorry, officer.\" Stuart as Willy Wonka tries to pick up a girl, claiming to have come up with all the party food and decorations, much to Raj's disgust. Raj is Indian Jones, the love child of Indiana Jones. Amy and Sheldon show up as \"Raggedy C-3PO\" and Raggedy Ann due to \"a compromise\". As Raj complains to Howard about Stuart taking credit for the party's them, Howard gets upset and compares Raj complaining about his party to him boasting about space. He sees Bernadette standing beside them and listening to their conversation and he just shouts \"Space!\" over and over again. Bernadette takes his beverage while calling him \"Drinky Smurf\" and pulls him into the room in the back. She confronts her husband on being rude, and Howard retaliates by saying that she's the one who's rude. After asking how that is true, Howard, mimicking her voice, whines about him talking about his space adventures too much. Bernadette says \"I don't sound like that\" in a deeper tone of voice. Howard then tells her that if it wasn't for him talking about going to space, he'd just be plain old Howard Walowitz. Bernadette reminds him that he is the best guy she knows and that she married him... \"on purpose.\" Penny and Leonard stumble out of the TARDIS all disheveled and Penny explains that there is nothing to see, only sexy police business.Leonard says that he was explaining to her the theory of relativity ...twice.\nAt the end, Howard gets a YouTube clip from Raj showing Buzz Aldrin, the second man on the moon, handing out Halloween candy to kids mentioning his trip to space to every kid. Howard tells Bernadette that he now understands everybody's objections to his boasting.Title reference: Penny is sexually aroused by Leonard's demonstration of his holographic projector.", "episode_22": "Leonard is teaching Penny how to launch a toy foam rocket using his computer. Sheldon discovers that Professor Proton (Bob Newhart), the Mr. Wizard of his youth, is alive. He is now available to perform at children's birthday parties. Sheldon wants to hire him so he can do experiments for them, hang out with them, and maybe even take twelve photos with them to make their own calendar. Sheldon emails him as Leonard and Sheldon sing his theme song: \"Grab your goggles, put your lab coat on. Here he comes, Professor Proton.\"At the Caltech cafeteria, Raj asks Howard to watch his dog over the weekend while he spends time in the telescope lab. Howard says that he'll talk to his wife about sitting Raj's dog. Sheldon comes running in to announce that Professor Proton will be coming to their place. Howard wonders how Sheldon got him to come. Sheldon then quotes Professor Proton, \"There is no problem you can't solve if you use your brain\" and later says that he wrote him a big check.Raj shows up at Howard and Bernadette's Apartment with his Yorkie, Cinnamon in a fancy stroller telling the dog that she is going to have a sleepover at Uncle Howard's place. Her diet consists of people food including veal chops and scampi. He also has to close the toilet seat since she drinks out of it.That night Sheldon calls Leonard through the wall because he can't get to sleep due to Professor Proton's visit the next day. He tells Leonard that he is planning on wearing a tuxedo and asks Leonard if he has any cuff links which Leonard does not.When Howard and Bernadette return from the park with Raj's dog, they find the stroller empty. Each of them tells the other that it was their job to put her back in the stroller.Sheldon is staring out the peephole because Professor Proton is late. Professor Proton calls Sheldon to say that he is stuck on the third floor building landing having to walk up three flights of stairs taking half an hour to do so. All three of them find Professor Proton sitting on his suitcase with Sheldon exclaiming, \"It's really you!\" Leonard apologizes that they should have told him about the broken elevator. Exhausted, the Professor agrees.\nThe Professor says to just call him Arthur. Arthur remarks that a friend would have told him about the elevator. Leonard introduces himself and Penny whom the Professor obviously likes. Arthur is confused when he learns that there is no children's birthday party. As they climb the final stairs, he says that since the blonde girl is really his girlfriend that Leonard is the true genius.Leonard tells Arthur that they just wanted to hang out with him and learn about his life. Arthur explains that after his show ended, birthday parties were the only work he could get. He then asks if he has it straight, that they are two physicists who want him to do a children's science show for them. Arthur tells them that he is a real scientist with a PhD from Cornell University. Sheldon then asks if he brought his puppet.Howard and Bernadette are driving around calling out for Cinnamon. Bernadette wonders if she is not coming because of Raj's accent, so they both start calling for Cinnamon in Raj's accent.Arthur is doing an experiment where he puts on an egg on top of a flask with a candle burring in it and asks what is going to happen as the air pressure decreases. The egg then falls into the flask. Sheldon then wants him to do the potato clock where he powers the clock using the potato as a battery. Penny is impressed and says that that could solve the world's energy crisis, which Arthur denies.\nThe Professor then tells them to keep their money because he is done. Arthur tells them that he is tired of being Professor Proton whom Sheldon tells him is \"the best.\" Arthur tells them that his puppeteer slept with his wife. Sheldon has an autographed picture of Professor Proton from when he was a kid. Sheldon explains that he didn't have any friends growing up and every day at 4 PM Professor Proton would come to his house and they would do science experiments together. Otherwise Sheldon might have ended up as a hobo or a surgeon. Professor Proton inspired millions of kids to become scientists and all these discoveries are in part his work too. Arthur then sits down thinking that he is having a problem with is pacemaker.In the telescope lab, Raj gets a call from someone who found his dog. Raj thanks him and heads to pick her up and telling him to not give her anything starchy.Arthur is now strapped to a gurney under the care of two paramedics. Sheldon volunteers to ride with him to the hospital in the ambulance.While Howard is printing out a lost dog poster, Bernadette thinks that since they lost the dog, she'd be a terrible mother. Raj video calls Howard and Bernadette. Howard tells him that Bernadette just took her out for a walk. Raj says that that is interesting and asks if they walking down Liars Lane. A lane frequented by liars as he holds up Cinnamon.\nBernadette is angry that he has had her for hours while they both had massages to calm down. She asks him why he couldn't have picked up a phone and called since they were worrying themselves sick about her.At the hospital, Sheldon sings Professor Proton \"Soft Kitty\". Arthur tells Sheldon that he is not feeling up to doing his act scheduled for the next day, so he asks Sheldon to be Professor Proton. Sheldon considers that an honor like ascending Mt. Olympus to dine with the gods. Realizing that they will know he is not the real Professor Proton, Sheldon asks Arthur if it is all right with him if he goes by Professor Proton Jr. Arthur agrees.Title Reference: \"Professor Proton\" re-enters Sheldon and Leonard's lives after being their childhood hero.", "episode_10": "While playing the Ticket to Ride board game, Sheldon complains about the Spider-Man theme song which is his third favorite cartoon theme song preceded by Inspector Gadget and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Even though the song says that he can do whatever a spider can, he can't crawl into your ear and die, legally leave Guatemala without a passport, or have sex with another spider.\nRaj suggests a evening of movie sequels that killed their franchises. Leonard mentions Jaws 4, Indiana Jones 4 or Daredevil 1. Raj mentions Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous. Leonard agrees because Penny is working, but Howard is having dinner with his in-laws and Sheldon has to attend a memorial service with Amy. Sheldon suggests that Howard could bring up an interesting topic to pass the time with the Rostenkowski's like problems with the Spider-Man song or that you can't really dig through the center of the Earth to China from the United States.Sheldon arrives at Amy's dressed to attend a funeral and finds her in a bathrobe with the flu. Amy asks if he is going to take care of her per their Relationship Agreement, but Sheldon leaves saying that the clause is so she can take care of him. He plans to return to the movie sequel marathon. Amy says goodnight and Sheldon head down the hall but returns to her door and knocks. Sheldon explains that he has a commitment to her in writing to care for her and that as his girlfriend he is concerned about her well-being.Howard is sitting with his father-in-law trying to make conversation as dinner is being prepared getting very short answers; his retirement is \"fine\". Mrs. Rostenkowski's trip to the Grand Canyon was \"good\". All of Howard's jokes also fall flat and dinner will not be ready for quite a while.Meanwhile, Sheldon is checking Amy's temperature of 102.2 degrees Fahrenheit and it is the same as half an hour before. He tells Amy that she isn't trying to get better. He asks if she believes in the placebo effect and then gives her a Tic Tac, telling her that it is a strong flu medication. Amy doesn't like his bedside manner and tries to get to sleep. Sheldon said that she can't sleep because he is not done taking care of her. He has to put a cold rag on her head, sing to her (presumably \"Soft Kitty\") and rub Vicks_VapoRub on her chest which is exactly what his mother did and what Penny did for him when he was sick. Amy perks up and says that he should start with the Vicks. He tells that it might tingle and she replies that she is counting on it.The subject of M. Rostenkowski's weekend fishing trip comes up. Bernadette suggests that Howard go with him so that they can get to know each other better. His mother-in-law looks at her husband and he says that Howard can tag along. Howard resists, but Bernadette makes him to agree to do it.Back at the apartment, Howard complains that he doesn't know how to fish and neither do Leonard or Raj. They wonder who knows how to do manly stuff and they end up at Penny's door. First Penny shows Howard how to put a worm on a hook. Howard first lays the worm across the hook, but Leonard is sure that he has to stab the worm with the hook.Back at Amy's, Sheldon is reading Amy a genetics scientific book like one would read a bedtime story. Amy thanks him and asks for more Vicks' VapoRub. Sheldon disagrees saying that she needs to rest and that the Vicks only gets her all fired up. Bernadette visits Amy to check on her and brings some experimental drugs with some unusual side effects. While Sheldon goes to fix Amy a bath, she admits she has been well for two days and that she has been enjoying Sheldon taking care of her. She plans on telling him tomorrow, but Sheldon is now going to help her with her bathing, saying \"Mama needs a bath.\"Penny shows Howard how to gut a fish (if he were to catch one from a miracle). She tells him to take the knife, slice the fish right up the belly, which causes Howard to gag. She then tells him that he will not want to cut too deep into the fish's guts or the blood will squirt all over Howard's face.\nLeonard's dad was an anthropologist whose father-son time was spent only with a 2000-year-old skeleton of an Etruscan boy, a kid who Leonard hated; Raj's dad just took Raj to his gynecology office and Raj got so bored, he'd put vaginal lubricant at the bottom of his shoes and pretend he was ice-skating; Howard's quality father-son time was spending his adolescence looking out the window waiting for his dad to come back some day.\nHoward then successfully pulls out the fish's insides and the guys are pleased until Penny points out that it is a female as all the eggs can be seen which causes all the guys to get queasy again.Back at Amy's apartment, she is dancing to \"Walking on Sunshine\" and drinking a drink soda until Sheldon shows up. Amy tells him that she is taking a turn for the worst and needs another bath. Sheldon tells her that he was concerned about her lengthy recovering and took a cheek swab from her and had a throat culture lab report made. Then he asks her if she has symptoms of a growing nose or heat in the lower extremities, meaning \"liar, liar, pants on fire\". Amy apologizes, but Sheldon thinks that she needs to be punished. Amy suggests that she should not be allowed to see the premiere of the new Star Trek movie. Sheldon says that that would be overly harsh since she hadn't killed anyone. Sheldon decides to go old school like his father who did not spare the rod. She is intrigued that Sheldon wants to spank her. Amy seems fine with Sheldon spanking her and she admits that she's been a very bad girl.Howard shows up for his fishing trip dressed like a cartoon fisherman. Mike also plans to hunt some ducks in the morning. He likes using a big shotgun shell so that they explode. Howard says that he does want Mr. Rostenkowski to like him, but he doesn't think that this trip is the best way. Both guys admit that they are only going because their wives want them to go.\nSince neither wants to go, Mr. Rostenkowski suggests that they go to an Indian casino near Palm Springs. He'll teach Howard how to shoot craps and his son-in-law can now call him \"Mike\" instead of \"Sir\". As they get in the truck Howard says that they're married to a couple of ball busters. Mike points out that Howard is referring to his wife and daughter.As Sheldon asks Amy if she is prepared for her punishment and she puts on some romantic music so that \"the neighbors wouldn't hear her\". When she seems to be enjoying it, she suggests that maybe he should spank her harder and he does, which she seems to enjoy even more.Title reference: The fish cleaning lesson that Penny gives the men.", "episode_4": "Over dinner, the gang can't wait for Howard to return. Sheldon tells Stuart that he had a good run as the \"fake Wolowitz\", but an offer for 30% off comic books from Stuart makes Sheldon change his mind and say, \"Welcome aboard, old chum.\"\nHoward and his fellow astronauts plummet through the atmosphere with Howard alternately praying and screaming. He feels a jerk and remarks that \"that wasn't so bad\". Unfortunately that jerk was the parachutes opening and they have six more miles to go. Howard starts screaming again.Howard feels dejected when he finds out that his friends are not waiting for him at the airport at the request of Bernadette. In the waiting room he hears shouts of \"Howie, Howie\", but the reporters present are covering the arrival of comedian Howie Mandel (who doesn't believe that Howard is an astronaut). At Bernadette's (and Howard's as well) apartment she dresses in a negligee and tells him that it's like their honeymoon since he left right after their wedding ceremony. After coughing a few times due to a cold, she falls asleep from the Benadryl.Later, Howard goes to his mother's house where she doesn't let him in. He hears a man's voice which his mother says is the television and then Howard's dentist whom she is having an affair with, hops out the window.Howard's next stop is Raj's who is very glad to see him. The twist is that Stuart is now living with him and they have tickets to the sold-out Sound of Music sing-along. Howard leaves them to their night out.At the apartment, Sheldon laments that he wasn't getting to see Howard's expression that night when he gives him his admiration for the first time. Amy and Penny are playing Pictionary against Leonard and Sheldon. Sheldon's drawing concepts and guesses are too complicated and confusing for Leonard and the girls win. For the word \"polish\", Sheldon draws things that are Polish like sausage and Madame Curie while Penny waits a few minutes to enjoy his act and then draws a hand, paints the nails and Amy says (nail) polish. Then they tell the boys that they can beat them in any contest. Penny does not want to play \"Physics Fiesta\" where physics questions are given in Spanish since Sheldon just made up the game. Sheldon doesn't want to play darts, pool, beer pong, or have a wet t-shirt contest since they are bar games and Penny has been going to bars since she was of age. Amy suggests water polo and Operation with real cadavers. Next, Amy and Leonard try Where's Waldo? without their glasses and Amy wins. Penny and Sheldon try a contest where they are spinning around a light-saber and then rush over to do a division problem while still dizzy. Although she spun a bit faster than him, Penny beats Sheldon at mathematics because he falls over and knocks down his whiteboard. Next, Penny is wrestling with Sheldon who is pinned almost instantly and can't get up. Then Penny has to try and kiss Sheldon. Sheldon asks Amy to do something, so she joins in also kissing him.Finally, it is a standard state fair pie eating contest. After they start, Howard shows up. The gang looks up with their faces covered with blueberry pie filling, and yell, \"Not now\", too busy with their rivalry to give him any kind of attention.Finally, Howard ends up at a diner where the waitress recognizes him as an astronaut and offers him a free piece of cheesecake. Howard starts to tell her his problems and she replies asking whether he wants the cheesecake or not. He starts eating singing \"Rocket Man\" quietly to himself. A quick sneeze makes him think that he caught something from Bernadette and he sarcastically says \"perfect\".Title reference: Howard expects a big celebration upon his return to Earth from Space; however, the excitement is kept to a bare minimum.", "episode_6": "Howard and Raj are dancing to Star Wars characters using the Galactic Dance Off video game. They think they look cool, but Leonard tells them that they look the same way at their dance clubs. Sheldon announces that he has begun playing Words with Friends with Professor Stephen Hawking, making them friends. Leonard is very happy for him. According to Sheldon, the other guys should be happy because they are a friend with an official friend of Stephen Hawking and that they have may have now \"peaked\". Sheldon engages Hawking in the game on his Apple iPad. After Professor Hawking makes his first move, Sheldon feels that now they'll start making up fun nicknames for each other. He'll be \"Coop\" and the Professor will be \"Wheels\".Penny, Amy, and Bernadette (Penny's Posse) are hanging out at Penny's apartment where Bernadette tells them that she found herself drying her body off with Howard's mother's underwear. She immediately took another shower that still wasn't enough.\nBernadette finds Penny's history textbook for a class that Penny was taking at Pasadena City College. She was just trying to go back to college. Amy also mentioned that her acting career was going south like Sherman. She hasn't told Leonard because he'll get all excited about it, be so proud of her and try to help her which makes her gag. Amy tells her that they are the weirdest couple she knows.While Sheldon is playing Words with Friends, Amy is happy that her boyfriend is friends with Stephen Hawking and her new dandruff shampoo doesn't smell like tar. Sheldon tells Amy that he is badly beating Professor Hawking, to which Amy comments that when one man dominates another, it can raise their testosterone level. Amy thinks it's exciting that Sheldon might even be getting a testosterone level. He is now calling the Professor \"Stephen\" because he did not like \"Wheels\". Amy suggests \"extract\" as Sheldon's next word, though he objects because it would be cheating if he didn't think of it. He decides to use the unrelated word \"extract\" (different pronunciation).Leonard and Penny are eating spaghetti at Penny's apartment that is a bit crunchy since she didn't boil the water enough. Penny tells him about her history class which Leonard tells her is great, but she doesn't want him to make a big deal out of it. Leonard goes on about full time college and transferring to a four-year school and Penny cools him down with \"you're making it a big deal\". She thinks the class is going real well and that she has to turn in her first paper on the origins of slavery. Leonard suggests several perspectives and Penny feels her perspective is that slavery is bad especially since she has a African American. Penny won't let him see her paper, though later he does have a chance to sleep with a college girl.During dinner in Sheldon's apartment, Raj tells them that he wants to develop an American accent when he calls an Indian call center since he feels his own voice sounds like he is making fun of them. Sheldon is lamenting that fact that Professor Hawking hasn't made a move for three days in a game that Sheldon was humiliating in. Howard remarked that the Professor is a big baby and doesn't like to lose. After Howard had corrected Hawking about Johnny Depp not being in the The Matrix movie, Howard didn't get invited to his staff pizza party.That night, Leonard slips out of bed with Penny and reads her paper on her laptop. After a couple of 'a hems' Leonard decides Penny's writing is just as terrible as the spaghetti she made for dinner. Leonard goes back to his apartment and finds Sheldon using the Force Jedi mind control trick to get Professor Hawking to play. Leonard tells him that he did a bad thing by reading it behind her back. Sheldon tells him about Hawking not playing. Since they are talking about different subjects at the same time, Leonard pulls out the chess timer and that they will take turns discussing their problems. Leonard tells Sheldon to give the Professor some time and Sheldon doesn't care about his problem with Penny, as his only advice is: \"Women, Huh?\" Leonard leaves in frustration to which Sheldon tries to get him back with the Jedi mind trick. It seems to work when Leonard hears his name mentioned, though Sheldon figures it's because it only works on the weak-minded.In the morning at 8 AM, Leonard shows up with breakfast in bed and a folder on the tray. Leonard gives Penny the story of the \"Shoemaker and the Elves\" and leads into giving her a new history paper. Penny argues that he assumed that the paper would be bad and then wrote her a new one. Leonard replied that he assumed that it would be good and then read it. She found that he had changed every word and then Leonard pointed out the years listed, the word slavery and her name hadn't changed. Penny calls him an ass and that that was why she didn't want to tell him in the first place. Leonard explained that he just didn't want her to get a bad grade, get discouraged and quit school. Penny turned it around that her being in school was so important to him and that he didn't want to date a girl that was just a waitress.At the Caltech cafeteria, Raj and Howard commiserate with Sheldon over not playing with Professor Hawking. Raj comments that if he is a sore loser, then maybe he isn't that good of a friend. Sheldon agrees and says that he'll just have to make lemonade out of the two of them as friends implying that they are lemons. Finally Professor Hawking takes his turn. Sheldon is excited to be playing again with \"Rolling Thunder\" which is an acceptable nickname. Sheldon debates whether to throw the game. Finally he decides to let Professor Hawking win.Penny shows up at Leonard's door after they had not seen each other for a couple of days. Leonard wonders if she was still mad at him. Penny says that there was no reason for her to \"B\" mad at him. Minus. She presents a \"B-\" on her paper. She says that it was on her paper and not his \"you punk ass elf\".\nShe leaves and then returns to Amy and Bernadette in her apartment. She tells the girls that if they ever tell Leonard that they helped her with the paper, that she will beat each of them with a bag of oranges. They both agree. Penny then explains that next time maybe they can put their heads together and get an \"A\". Bernadette explained that her \"B-\" was on purpose to make it believable. Penny snapped back that they didn't think that she was smart enough? The girls felt like they were back in high school doing the prom queen's homework so that she would like them.Finally, Sheldon gets a phone call from Stephen Hawking. He thanks him for the game and calls him Dr. Cooper or Dr. Loser. Sheldon congratulates him on winning. Prof. Hawking asks him if he likes brain teasers. \"What do Sheldon Cooper and a black hole have in common? They both suck. Neener, Neener.\" Leonard, who was present, laughs his head off upon hearing this.Title reference: The word Sheldon used to take a lead in the game \"Words with Friends\", which he played with Stephen Hawking.

She really does appear to miss him. Sheldon has time on his hands and wants to know what others are doing inquiring who wants to get their \"Sheld-on\". Howard and Bernadette are cleaning their house. Not interested. Raj is using a telescope to look for new planets, which Sheldon finds interesting. He asks what Leonard is doing and he's having a \"Sheld-off\" weekend.Penny comes home complaining that Dr. Gallo (Jane Kaczmarek), the psychiatrist, won't let her pitch her drugs to her. Raj suggests that Leonard might visit her as a patient though he argues that he doesn't have any problems. The guys mention several.Howard and Bernadette are in Au Naturel after their incredible love making session. Both wish they didn't have to be so quiet since Stuart lived next door. Stuart knocks and they decide to let him in. Since they are going to start remodeling he has found an apartment and is moving out.While Raj is working on the telescope, Sheldon is bored and keeps asking him what he was doing. When Sheldon was taken to work by his father, he figured out in ten minutes who was taking money out of the register. It was his father and he got him fired. Raj sits in front of a numerical database from six months of observations to look for patterns or anomalies that might indicate a new planet. Sheldon immediately finds a pattern.Leonard visits Dr. Gallo who immediately asks about Dr. Beverly Hofstadter. Yes, she is his mother. She has read all of his mother's books so Leonard thinks she knows him better than himself. Gallo doesn't agree with Beverly's mention of raising children. He wonders if she finds them cold, cruel and unsuitable for little boys who just want to be happy. Leonard admits that he still sends her mother a greeting card and gift on his birthday because Beverly insists that his birth was her accomplishment. Dr. Gallo says that this is horrible.Howard and Bernadette are helping Stuart pack his car. Howard mentions that they could now get romantic in any room in the house. Stuart finishes filling his car and wonders if everyone thought he would still be there two years after moving in with Debbie. After Stuart drives off, Howard appears in his underwear ready to have sex in the garage.Back in the telescope lab, Raj combines all their photographic images and discovers that Sheldon found a new medium-sized asteroid that they hoped would be a trans-Neptunian object or a dwarf planet. First Sheldon calls the discovery \"Chicken fingers\" until they both admit that they like chicken fingers. Now they get to come up with a name for their new asteroid, one that people can't make fun of like \"Uranus\".Leonard returns home feeling great about his talk with Dr. Gallo. Leonard has always been insecure that he didn't feel that people wanted to listen to what he had to say... and then Penny interrupts him asking if she can see her. Leonard feels neglected again. Dr Gallo has agreed to see her.Howard and Bernadette are cleaning out Stuart's old bedroom and start to wonder if they are going to turn it into a home theater, game room or a man-cave. Bernadette suggests a woman-cave or a home office. She then finds a stuffed bear that Stuart had won since they couldn't guess his age. Both wondered how he was doing since he hadn't called. He could have done that. First they deny it and then Bernadette realizes that: \"Ewww, we are missing him!\"Raj and Sheldon return to his apartment and are talking about naming their discovery. Sheldon suggests \"Koo\" from Koothrappali and \"per' from Cooper for Kooper. Raj adds that at least he would know what the K stood for. Returning to the asteroid, Leonard suggests that they name it after their girlfriends to show them how much they care about them. Sheldon thinks about it, feeling that that is romantic and would get them out of giving Valentine's Day presents forever. He suggests \"AM\" for Amy and \"Y\" for Emily or Amy. Raj is not impressed.Penny finishes her pill pitch about anxiety medicine to Dr. Gallo and asks her if she has any questions. She wants to know why she made Leonard pretend to be a patient. What were you thinking? Penny quietly tells her that she was talking about the drugs. Then the doctor asks why she would marry Leonard. Leonard was raised by an overbearing woman during his formative years. Is he continuing that by marrying a woman like Penny? Penny replies that she used to wear a lot of tank tops.Sheldon is again Skyping with Amy. He called her an asteroid. Amy doesn't understand. Sheldon explains that they discovered one and named it after her (After negotiating with him that he would name his firstborn Rajesh, even if it's a girl). She doesn't seem enthusiastic about having to name all their children Raj, even the girls.Penny is now on the couch with Dr. Gallo saying that how can she not be like his mother since he has all these toys (Including a stuffed Wookie in the room they have sex in.) Penny thinks that she is turning her into his mother. She used to be an actress and a pretty good one. Hot, girl-next-door type. Doable. Not only is she his mother, but they have a man-child living with him named Sheldon. Dr. Gallo says that Leonard mentioned him a lot and she didn't even think he was real. He is as real as the fines he gives Penny for using too much toilet paper. Penny admits that Leonard was right that talking things out with her helped. Dr. Gallo gives Penny a prescription to help her through her anxiety issues. She suggested Penny take some, but she did not want the product that might give her fits of homicidal rage.Sheldon misses Amy. Amy misses Sheldon. Howard and Bernadette miss Stuart. Penny misses when life was simpler.

A cute blonde woman Claire (Alessandra Torresani) next to them adds her own factoids to their argument and then joins in.Meemaw is resting in Sheldon's spot after climbing what she describes as 800 flights of stairs. Sheldon gets really excited as Amy arrives to meet Meemaw. He is sure that they will hit it off since they both have the same fashion sense. They both greet each other and Amy asks about her flight. Sheldon runs off to get her room ready, but not to look in her suitcase for any presents. He might find her brassieres and bloomers. Meemaw then gets honest with Amy. She came to Pasadena to \"size her up.\" Amy retorts that she'll probably like her once she gets to know her. Meemaw snaps that she better hope so. Sheldon runs in excited about the train set that she brought him.At the comic book store, Raj and Howard sit down with Claire and talk about the comic she was reading. Raj introduces himself and Howard. She is a screenwriter/bartender/a month away from living in her car. Raj admits that he is an astrophysicist which excites Claire.

Besides Sheldon takes a lot of care and Leonard's job is more of a hobby according to Sheldon.Amy tells her that maybe she knows more about what Sheldon needs. Meemaw appreciates her honesty and is honest with and says that she doesn't like her. Amy replies that maybe she doesn't like her. Sheldon gets upset that they have to like each other.\nMeemaw exclaims that under no circumstances should he give her that engagement ring. That stops Amy cold. What? Sheldon admits to Amy that he has one. Amy then asks Penny if she knew about it; however, realizing the situation, Penny leaves with Leonard since she didn't want to answer Amy's question. Meemaw reiterates that her ring is never going to be on this woman's finger. Sheldon doesn't want to correct her Meemaw and Amy says that she might not want to be engaged to Sheldon or have her old hand-me-downs. Sheldon argues that they have only known each other for less than a day and then wonders if their menstruation cycles have synced. Meemaw tells Sheldon to leave so that the grownups can talk.While fixing dinner, Bernadette summarizes Raj's dilemma as they met, exchanged phone numbers and are meeting just to discuss her screenplay. That seemed okay with her. Howard insists that something was going on between them. \"A little flirting never hurt\" replies BernadetteLeonard and Penny are in her apartment talking about Penny's grandmother. The most exciting thing about her was wondering if the ash from her cigarette would fall into her pudding, which it did (she even ate it).While having dinner, Raj has decided to call Claire and also tell her that he is in a relationship. He gets Claire at her job and she wonders when he is free. Raj first wants to tell her that he has a girlfriend. She thinks that that is great. Raj doesn't want to mislead her since she asked him out. It was only to discuss her screenplay she insists. Raj wishes Claire good luck on her screenplay.

Raj is still not planning on telling Emily about this.Amy tells Meemaw that she is still Sheldon's best shot and that she has no idea how much she had to put up with. Meemaw replies that she knows her better than she thinks. She had to live with Sheldon's Pop-pop who was also a stubborn, egotistical man.

He feels he is losing his grasp on reality and may soon forget what a toilet is.Two days earlier Sheldon and Leonard are in Apartment 4A working on a physics problem. Sheldon is humming to himself though at first he doesn't realize he was humming. After Sheldon knows that he is humming he tries to figure it out and fix words to it. Leonard wants to work telling Sheldon just has an ear-worm that will disappear.Later, Sheldon is on the phone trying to get someone to help him with the tune and is surprised the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame couldn't help him.

That means going barefoot outdoors.Amy nervously calls David Gibbs asking if he wanted to try going on another date. He is happy to do so.Raj is slumming in Howard's lab while Howard is busy working talking about the Department of Outer Space Affairs at the United Nations. Raj had set up a Facebook page for their band, \"Footprints on the Moon\". One person comments on their page telling them that their band rocks which excites them.Sheldon is sitting at his piano playing the tune over and over again. Sheldon's other project is to leave his future crazy self-messages. Music is bad. Penny is his friend and he can accept any food that she gives him, especially since he probably paid for it already.Bernadette visits Amy discussing her next date with Dave. She tells her that Sheldon turned her down. And that Dave was talking all night about Sheldon. Amy is making him dinner which Bernadette says is a big step since it could lead to sex. Maybe that's what Amy needs. Bernadette reacts that making her first time with a guy six-foot-seven is like taking her driving test with a bus.Raj and Howard want to respond to their fans. Raj suggests: We may be \"Footprints on the Moon'', but you sent us over the moon. Howard wants: Thanks for digging' our vibe. We'll keep rocking while you keep rolling. They posted it.

Then he starts playing it on his new tuba.In the morning, Sheldon is again making videos for his future crazy self. The ideal thermostat setting is 72 degrees. Then he shows him his spot that he is very protective of. Anyone who sits there shows be berated, but in an adorable manner.Raj and Howard are checking Trent out on the Internet. Bernadette reminds them that they only played together once. And at a children's hospital until they were asked to leave. Raj finds out that he is at a coffee shop and both of them want to meet him.Their date starts well as Dave enjoys her meal since he usually doesn't get many home-cooked meals. His former wife wasn't much of a cook until she started cheating on him with the chef. Dave wonders how long she'd live there. About five years though she was thinking of moving to a better place now that she didn't have to be close to... She stopped and apologized for bringing him up. Dave was pretty excited to find Sheldon lived nearby. Dave changes the subject and asks where she got her neat model train from.Sheldon continues to play the tune including gargling it. Sheldon then lists some scientific geniuses that were crazy. He follows with other notable people like Van Gogh, Pollock, Bobby Fischer, Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys...Something clicks in Sheldon's brain and he realizes the song is \"Darlin'\" by The Beach Boys. He is greatly relieved that he is not crazy.Raj and Howard are at the coffee shop observing Trent who is listening to music on his laptop. Raj wants to go up to him, but Howard thinks it would be cooler if he discovered them. The guy's euphoria dies when they see Trent picking his nose and that didn't bother them. But eating it, that is too much to bear. While they make a hasty retreat, Trent does recognize them, but they deny it.Sheldon is listening to the song and wonders why he was stuck on that one. Sheldon does realize why it was that song. It was about Amy and how she made his life better. Checking out the lyrics he finds the following: \"I was living like half a man, then I couldn't love, but now I can, You pick me up when I'm feeling sad, More soul then I ever had.\" Sheldon calls Amy the dryer sheets of his heart and then goes to see her.Amy and Dave are awkwardly sitting on the couch. Amy leans over to admire Dave's tie pin. He leans in and kisses her. Amy jumps back. As they approach each other, Sheldon knocks on the door. Dave is excited as Amy goes to answer the door. She tells Sheldon that it's not a good time. Sheldon says he doesn't care and that he had a song stuck in his head that he couldn't get out. The song was about her and he can't get her out of his head. Amy is like that ear-worm, but is in his heart. She is his heart-worm, but not the poodle killing kind. Amy doesn't understand.\nDave jumps in saying, \"If I may, I believe what he is saying in a charming and delightful way is that he loves you and wants you back.\" Amy is stunned as Sheldon realizes that she is on a date. Amy wants him to continue. Sheldon tells Amy he wants to be her boyfriend again and that he loves her. Amy tells him she loves him too.

Howard looks over to her and asks whether she is sure. Pretty positive like the pregnancy test she is holding. They kiss and Howard exclaims that they can now board planes first and use the mall's family bathroom. Then, Howard starts to panic and wonders how everything is going to work. Get a pretty nanny? An ugly nanny? The pretty one would wreck their marriage, while the ugly one would scare the kid. Then, he worries about whether they should raise it Catholic or Jewish or get him circumcised.While getting ready to play a board game, Leonard mentions that someone in Raj's department thinks they have discovered a new planet in our solar system. Sheldon quips that Raj should let him know when he wins the Nobel Prize for boys en berry (He was making jam for the boys). Howard arrives and tells the guys that he is going to be a father. Leonard and Raj instantly congratulate him; however, Sheldon immediately thinks that a baby will change everything and ruin all their fun activities. He asks questions such as \"How can you have fun with a kid going to Disneyland?\"The Posse is meeting on the back porch. Bernadette has something to tell the girls; Penny ruins it by blurting out a text she is reading off of her phone from Leonard. While Bernie is happy with this news, she is not only worried about Howard flipping out, but also about the fact that she is going to get fat. Penny reassures her that she will be glowing and have the cutest little baby bump ever.Howard is now shouting at his friends that he shouldn't be having a child because he doesn't even eat his own vegetables. And what if the kid has his big nose? Sheldon is worried that he won't be over as often to play games. Raj thinks that Howard can bring him over. Sheldon adds that they will have to baby proof the apartment. Even Sheldon can't operate the lock on his sister's toilet. He is also worried about the cost of raising a child. In Los Angeles, the cost of raising a child through college could be one million dollars. With that thought in mind, Howard has to figure out a way to earn more money. They decide to go out and celebrate.Penny thinks that going out to celebrate would get Bernadette's mind off her problems. To a bar? She can't drink. To that sushi place she loves? She can't have sushi. Why not use her hot tub? She can't do that either. Amy thinks that she can't laugh anymore either.The guys take Howard to a Tiki bar where they toast his big heart, his beautiful soul and his tight pants that didn't make him sterile. Howard still worries about his financial future. The guy that invented those little umbrellas has no problems with money. Sheldon keeps downing his drinks getting plastered. Howard wants to invent a larger cocktail umbrella, but Apple already has the market on making things of different sizes. The guys propose a sophisticated guidance system based upon Leonard and Sheldon's super-fluid theory. It was originally from an idea for a guidance system for drunks to keep them safe and on track.While the girls continue talking about the news, Amy mentions how much fun it is to buy toys and cute little clothes. She already does that with Howard. And she'll never get hungry with a minivan whose floor is covered with Cheerios. Amy wonders when they decided to have a baby. They are all grownups and have had sex. Bernadette mentions that the baby wasn't really planned, and that one night when Sheldon was going on about time zones and railroad schedules, she and Howard ended up in Sheldon's bedroom and conceived a child which shocks Amy.The guys are checking the Internet to see if anyone else had the idea they came up with. No one. Sheldon agrees with their calculations. Leonard mentions that even when drunk he was smarter than all of them. Howard wants them to get a patent for their idea so they can license it to companies to use in their guidance systems. Sheldon then tells Howard that they both know how hard it is growing up without a father; therefore, Howard is going to be a great father.The girls now have their feet dangling in the hot tub. Penny gets an invitation from Leonard to join them for karaoke. Amy gets a message from Sheldon and knows that he's drunk because he used a period instead of a question mark.When the girls arrive, Leonard and Raj are singing \"Bust a Move.\" Penny congratulates Howard. Amy sits next to Sheldon who is very glad to see her, but doesn't know how to \"bust a move\". Howard is finally excited with Bernie and apologizes. He says that he's done with being scared. Bernie replies that it's okay to be nervous since she is. They kiss, embrace and tell each other that they love each other. And that's not just because Bernadette's breasts will be getting bigger.On the stage in the Tiki bar, Penny and Amy sing Justin Bieber's song \"Baby\" to Bernadette while Raj sits in the audience lip-syncing the song. Howard then sings to her \"Baby I Need Your Loving.\" Sheldon raises his glass and smiles. Leonard and Raj then sing \"Push It\" by Salt-N-Pepa, both embarrassing her. In contrast to everything else, a drunken Sheldon sings \"My Country, 'Tis of Thee\". Howard gets up and sings a touching rendition of \"(You're) Having My Baby\" to Bernadette while dedicating the song to her; however, he doesn't get the chance to finish it because Sheldon shouts at Howard about using his bed to procreate.Back in Apartment 4A, Leonard and Penny say how happy they are for Howard and Bernadette and Leonard asks whether she is thinking about babies and she says she's not in a rush, but agrees and she asks Leonard what he thinks. Leonard says that he thinks they would make amazing parents. Meanwhile, a hung-over Sheldon is lying on the couch with a Harry Potter face and a mustache and beard, a line between his eyebrows and a line on his nose drawn on his face. Penny says that on the other they may lack a certain maturity, and holds up a marker indicating that she did the drawing on Sheldon's face.Title reference: Howard's initially positive then negative reaction to Bernadette's positive pregnancy test.", "episode_11": "Cue the Star Wars theme.

Sheldon points out that if he sees it later, someone could ruin the movie for him while he knows that on her birthday Amy is one year older.That night as Sheldon sleeps Arthur Jeffries (Bob Newhart) shows up dressed in Jedi robes. He has previously appeared when Sheldon needed advice. Sheldon explains that his friends don't think he should abandon his girlfriend on her birthday to see the new Star Wars movie. Arthur feels that that sounds right and complains that his Jedi robes have no undergarments. Arthur points out that since he loves her, he should show her how much she means to him. Also he has only a limited time to spend with her and he should do that.Sheldon then calls up Amy who is asleep to tell her that he'll be with her on her birthday.\nThe next evening, the guys are surprised Sheldon is giving up the movie for Amy.

Penny tells him that being intimate is a big step. Sheldon feels that it might be the right time and he wants to show her how much she means to him. Penny calls his offer beautiful. Sheldon then has decided that Amy's birthday present is going to be his genitals.The Posse duo of Penny and Bernadette are taking Amy out for her birthday a day early. Penny wonders if she would rather go get a bikini wax. She says no. Bernadette then suggests that afterwards they watch a dirty movie and see if she has any questions. Now she wants to know what's up. Bernie doesn't want to ruin anything, but says that Sheldon plans on getting physical tomorrow night. Amy exclaims, \"YOU SHUT YOUR DAMN MOUTH!\". The girls are happy for her. Amy jumps up knowing what to say: \"Let's get me waxed!\" as she races down the stairs.Arthur returns to Sheldon wondering why he can't appear in Angie Dickinson's bedroom.

Someone calls out that Star Trek stinks. Wil replies, \"Live long and suck it.\"Amy is in her apartment with romantic music (Super Mario Brothers theme song) playing and surrounded by lit candles. Sheldon knocks with \"Birthday girl\" as his usual knock. Sheldon suggests going out to dinner. She says that she is not that hungry so maybe he could give her a present first. She wants him to give \"it\" to her. Amy says that she knows he was going to offer her intimacy. Sheldon asks if that's okay. Amy jumps up and kisses him. Sheldon still needs to have her verbal consent, which she immediately says yes to.Leonard asks Wil why he is there if he doesn't like the movie. Wil explains that he is enjoying himself and that his point is that people shouldn't take the Star Wars movie so seriously. And that if the movie is bad, it shouldn't ruin their life.Back in Apartment 4A, Bernadette wonders if Sheldon will really go through with it. Penny replied that he said he was ready. Penny thinks he can do it because she explained to him what it was like and after he stopped giggling, he sounded pretty sure of himself.Later, Sheldon is in Amy's bed slightly nervous wearing only a white T-shirt as Amy enters in a knee length pink nightgown. Sheldon notices that Amy is shaking and he asks her if she's cold. Amy admits she's nervous because this is their first time. Sheldon also doesn't know what will happen and gently assures her that they will find out together. Amy agrees. They lean over and kiss.In the movie, Leonard is nervous and doesn't know what to expect. Howard says that they have been waiting so long.\"A few hours later in a bedroom not far away...\"\nNow naked, Sheldon remarks that he enjoyed it more than he thought he would.

Howard has built a gadget that adds mileage to his Fitbit and makes it appear that he has been jogging since Bernadette wants him to exercise more. Sheldon tells them that according to a study, even thinking about exercise could have physical benefits. They don't know if he is thinking about it right now. Leonard admits that it wouldn't hurt if they all did get more exercise. Howard agrees, so he turns up his gadget to work harder.Sitting in Sheldon's apartment, Leonard browses the various sports clubs available at the university: archery, rock climbing, flag football.... Sheldon comments that he had him at flags, but lost him at football. Penny agrees that they should get more active, but wonders if getting into a sport is the right choice. Leonard twisted his ankle while playing Scrabble. Barry Kripke (John Ross Bowie) is starting a fencing club. Sheldon sees It's indoors, no running, no throwing, no catching and no gym shorts that get pulled down or up.The girls are invited to the comic book store by Stuart. More women are now interested in comic books and he wants to get them into his store. He has been stocking more female-oriented titles, he added a triangle on the end of the toilet paper roll and also added a nursing mother's area where they were sitting. For extra security, he has an overhead camera to keep an eye on them for their protection to keep the pervs away. His action has the exact opposite effect, making him look like a perv. Penny looks uncomfortable and closes her blouse and legs. Amy thinks that he should change some of his artwork, like the woman in a dog collar on a leash.In the university gym, the guys are flexing their rapiers. Raj feels like Puss 'n' Boots while Leonard has always wanted to be a swashbuckler. Kripke joins them and explains that fencing is a serious sport and not Star Wars. First they practice the \"En Garde\" using their dominant leg. Sheldon doesn't think that he has a dominant leg and that they both are submissive. Howard tells him to use the one he flushes the public toilet with. Then they practice their advance and retreat. Sheldon wants to know when he can stab one of his friends. The fencing term is touch. Sheldon replies that if he says that he is going to touch one of his friends, he'll get sent to Human Resources again. Next they are paired up practicing the advance and retreat. When Kripke takes a phone call, they go crazy dueling until Kripke is done.Amy suggests that he advertise directly to females. Stuart then wants to put a sign in his window that says: Women come in. Don't be afraid. All of the women's online reviews are negative, and are about Stuart himself. One claims that Stuart stares at them without blinking, he asked one out, and an even worse review said that she liked his shirt and he took it off and gave it to her.Now their lesson involves thrusting forward all together. When Sheldon jousts with Leonard, he tells him to prepare for a vigorous touching. Raj and Howard fight with both wanting to be Inigo Montoya from \"The Princess Bride\" though Raj was supposed to be Puss 'n' Boots. Kripke then learns about the Shamy breakup and shows interest in Amy which upsets Sheldon. Leonard suggests to Barry that it wouldn't be a good idea to ask Amy out. Sheldon then approaches Barry and challenges him to a duel over Amy three years from now after Barry had finished teaching him the sport.Finally Stuart and the girls admit that the problem is Stuart himself. He gets nervous around women, though he doesn't nervous around his friend's girls. He uses the trick that he visualizes his audience as all naked. Stuart confesses that at this point in his life, he thought he would be married, or in a relationship or had a pet that didn't want to kill himself. Amy tries to explain to Stuart that she was alone for a long time and had to hide her insecurities after she met Penny and Bernadette. Stuart tells them that they all feel it, and yes he'll go out with her.The guys have gone to a sports bar since they are now athletes and Sheldon is having female problems. Howard urges him to forget about Amy and move on by starting to date. Sheldon thinks that that is ridiculous since both Penny and Bernadette are married and Raj's girlfriend with her red hair and white complexion reminds him too much of a clown which is one of his phobias. Leonard asks him if he might try a woman who is not in a serious relationship with one of his friends. Sheldon notices a blond woman walk by and decides to ask her out. He walks up to three women at a table and tells the attractive blonde that he is recovering from a recent breakup and has been told that asking out another would make him feel better. As Ash Ketchum said to Pikachu, \"I choose you.\" The blonde doesn't understand Sheldon, so he asks the next woman who is the first woman's grandmother and married. The third woman looks like Emily, which reminds Sheldon of a clown, so he tells her to give her regards to Barnum and Bailey.Back at Leonard and Penny's, Penny compliments Stuart for taking Amy's rejection, though he was on the breast cam. Amy then receives a drink invitation from Barry Kripke. Penny and Bernadette are shocked that Amy has had two date invitations in one day! Bernadette says that maybe she should move on to someone who is not like Sheldon. Not a scientist? Not a weirdo.Coming up the stairs, Sheldon complains of smelling funny and tasting salty. He has been sweating for once. Sheldon also wonders how many licks it would get to the center of him. (Like a Tootsie Pop). They run into Bernadette and Amy coming down the stairs. Leonard and Bernadette leave so they can talk. Sheldon continues that Barry Kripke was his instructor and that he was interested in taking her out. Amy replies that he did and she turned him down. Sheldon found that interesting since he also asked two ladies out and they both turned him down. His friends had told him that is was a good way to move on.Finally, Bernadette is checking her computer and wonders how Howard could run 174 miles in one day. Howard caught the deer in headlights while finishing the batter spoon.Title reference: The men getting all sweaty from exercising.", "episode_19": "Sheldon, Leonard, and Howard are patiently waiting to talk to the patent attorney to get a patent on their gyroscope idea from \"The Positive Negative Reaction.\" Howard wonders why Sheldon is wearing a bow tie. He wants to make a good impression. The guys are invited in. All their paperwork is in order and the legal team needs to look for other overlapping patents. They start musing about what they are going to do with their royalties and they learn that the university will get 75% of the total proceeds from their idea. On top of that, since Howard is a federal employee on loan from NASA, he'll get nothing. The lawyer tells him that he might get a plaque. Sheldon exclaims that that isn't fair. They should all get plaques. Leonard thanks him for his time and they leave the office without applying. Sheldon still wants to know about the plaque.The girls are hanging out at Leonard and Penny's apartment talking about Bernadette's pregnancy. She has had a little morning sickness and an increased sense of smell. She found where Howard hid the Girl Scout cookies. Raj shows up with a gift he received from Emily (Laura Spencer) sent to him after Valentine's Day. The girls think that she is trying to manipulate him. He's unsure if he should open it especially if it's something vindictive or dangerous. Penny has Bernadette sniff it and she detects some machine oil. In the box Raj finds an antique sextant used by sailors to navigate by the stars. Bernadette thinks that it is the perfect gift for an astrophysicist. Raj replies that he has too much self-esteem to let her get him back through a guilt trip. Amy quips that she doesn't have to be pregnant to smell that load of crap.Howard looks at the university's website and finds out that they can't patent it themselves. The university has rights to anything they develop as long as they are employed there. Sheldon is bummed that they get a part of his T-shirt and mug ideas. Leonard offers to at least split their 25% three ways. Sheldon gets very excited about getting to write up their deal in a contract. Leonard once found a stash of contracts under Sheldon's bed and found the whole situation weird.Examining the sextant, Amy checks the Internet and finds that it may have cost at least $500. Penny is sure that she is trying to get back together with him. Raj admits that he is easy to manipulate. Emily then calls him. The posse tells him to be strong. Emily wonders if he got the gift and if they could still be friends. Then Emily asks him to meet her for coffee. Raj hesitates as the girls do a lot of whispering between themselves. Emily ups the level by saying that she misses hanging out with him and that he lost her best friend. She wants him to come over as the girls shake their heads no. She also is having a really hard time which causes Penny to gag. They say goodbye and the girls tell him that he showed strength. As Raj leaves Penny tells him to say \"hi\" to Emily. \"Will do\" he says.Howard is reviewing Sheldon's contract and is happy with it. The girls come over to Sheldon and Leonard's, because Bernadette is tired and wants to go home. They learn about the contract and how the guys want to split up the royalties. Bernadette wants a lawyer to look it over. Howard is just happy that they found a way not to leave him out. Leonard mentions that everyone did contribute. Bernie tells him to go ahead and sign it if he wants to. The Wolowitzes adjourn to the hallway. Bernadette explains to Howard that he is about to sign a legal partnership with Sheldon Cooper. She doesn't want to spend the rest of her gestation hearing her husband complain how Sheldon is driving him even more crazy than usual. Anything they ever worked on together did not come out well.Raj is driving to Emily's when he gets a call from Claire. She says that she broke up with her boyfriend. Raj is interested, but admits that he's going to see Emily. Claire then asks if Emily said that she feels like she lost her best friend. Claire states \"That is page one of the girl's playbook\". Raj wants her to send him a copy of it.Returning, Howard explains that they are concerned about the partnership, so Sheldon suggests a limited liability corporation. Howard is more concerned with how Sheldon treats him. Penny suggests that they include a clause that Sheldon cannot make fun of Howard. That was fine with Sheldon who will follow the clause to the letter of the law. Amy adds and also because of his obsessive-compulsive disorder. The Wolwoitzes agree. Sheldon gets excited that now he gets to write an addendum.Emily calls and Raj tells her that it's not the best time to come over. He explains he's being manipulated. Raj calls Emily to say he isn't coming. Emily breaks into tears, so Raj calls Claire to change his plans. She again quotes Emily's line. He calls back Emily who again changes his mind and Claire tells him that she is manipulating him.The whole gang is reviewing the contract. Sheldon agrees to not mock Howard and his profession, hair cut, clothing or his love of the \"Ghost Rider\" movie. Also Sheldon donates one quarter of his profits to a college fund for the baby. Sheldon has always valued education over money and he realized how dismissive he had been of Howard's contribution. And he hopes that his efforts will rescue the child from the sub-par profession of being an engineer. Amy yells at Sheldon for his comment; however, Sheldon had not yet signed the contract.Finally, Claire is telling him that she knows how this is going to play out and to have a good life. Raj insists that they are just going to talk.

Amy found a study that those that spend time outside increase the reasoning abilities. Leonard says he will be happy to leave him in the wilderness at any time.Still in his virtual forest, Amy brings Sheldon some tea. Amy tells him that if he really wants to be out in nature, they could rent a cabin. Penny has a client who has offered her a cabin at Big Bear Lake. Leonard and Penny decide to spend the weekend there. Sheldon wants them to say hello to all the mosquitoes, bees, bears, snakes, possums, poison oak and teenagers with guitars.

Howard quips that he is surprised that Raj didn't help with the conception.Driving through the woods, Penny thinks everything is so cute and rustic. Leonard thought the last video store they saw looked like Colonial Williamsburg.Howard sees that Raj has pulled up and he wants to talk to him. Bernadette asks that he leave Raj alone. She feels that he is just being supportive and is not acting over-the-top. Raj then walks in with a teddy bear at least seven feet high and wider than the door.\nThe two couples arrive at the cabin. Amy remarks that it was so nice of the doctor to let them use it. Penny replied that she also has to go to an Indigo Girls concert with her.Amy and Penny look out the window at the downpour of rain and note that their hike is definitely canceled. They could kill their time with some board games, but Sheldon already checked that the games have too many missing pieces. Penny wants to light a fire.

Penny points out that Leonard would have never done this when they first met. He's cockier now.

The kissing wasn't that sexy especially since they were drunk, she tasted like an ashtray and he also chipped her tooth. Leonard jokingly says that he does not feel guilty because the girl had dental insurance. Leonard then says more seriously that he does feel guilty especially when he sees her every day at work.

Sheldon remarks that he really admired his father's work and that it is not often that he meet someone who started their life's journey in his hero's scrotum.Bernadette finds Howard in the kitchen making a bologna sandwich like his mother did after his father left and before she died. She suggests a compromise on doing one room which he considers reasonable. Kitchen? No, because that is the room he most associates with his mother. Bathroom? No, he wants to change his answer. Dining room? His family didn't use that very often, that is after his father left. Bernadette goes off to find some paint samples.Sheldon is sitting in his spot while Adam sets up and tries to make him comfortable. Leonard asks Wil if he is trying to get back at Adam by having him talk to Sheldon. Sheldon first saw Spock in \"The Galileo Seven\" episode. His brother came in and then sat on his head and told him to \"Eat farts\". Why does Spock appeal to him? Sheldon figures that it's the same for everyone, the dream of a cold rational world entirely without human emotion. Sheldon describes how everything is logical like when your brother is hitting you and one replies that that is not true since I am hitting myself and you are moving my arm. Then they start to discuss collectibles. Sheldon mentions the autographed napkin that Penny gave him.Sheldon then retrieves it from a wall safe that Leonard didn't know they even had. He put in the wall safe after he filled the floor safe. The floor safe came after a security camera was installed in the Aquaman statue. Leonard didn't know about any of this, which distresses him and Penny since they did things on the couch that Sheldon says he knows about.Raj is at Howard's house to help back him up since Bernadette and her father Mike (Casey Sander) are considering improvements to the dining room. They are thinking about taking down the wall between the dining room and the living room. Howard wonders if it is a load bearing wall and whether it can be removed. Raj tells them to go under the house and check.Sheldon brings out a locked box that contains his most prized possessions. The napkin has a Leonard Nimoy signature and since he wiped his mouth on it, they were in the presence of Leonard Nimoy's DNA. Next is a miniature Wil Wheaton action figure, his passport and then another Will (Last Will and Testament). Penny then asks about the ring box. Out comes the ring and Sheldon very calmly tells everyone that he was going to propose to his girlfriend. Sheldon says the ring was a family heirloom going back many generations.\nPenny wants to know if Amy knows about the ring. Sheldon states \"No, she broke up with him before he could ask her\". Sheldon claims everything turned out for the best and he's fine - Penny doubts this, which causes Sheldon to snap at her.Discussing his childhood, when Sheldon came to a dilemma, he would ask himself what Jesus would do. He changed his philosophy to what Spock would do. Did he find that helpful? Three years ago he found that Penny was eating his Pop Tart so instead of getting vindictive, he bought a floor safe. When he was eight years old a kid cornered him on the school play yard, so as Spock would he gave the kid his first Vulcan nerve pinch. Then the kid broke his collarbone.\nLike Spock he would rise above human emotions which Sheldon says that he has mastered. Penny gives him a raspberry. She feels that he is missing the whole point of Spock. He was half-human like Sheldon. He has feelings just like everybody else. Sheldon insists that he doesn't and that even though Amy broke up with him, he doesn't feel a thing. Penny says that he is yelling. Sheldon only does that when people don't believe him that he has put all this Amy nonsense behind him.Howard and Mike crawl under the house to look over the wall structure. Howard feels like an archaeologist. Indiana Jones and the Single-family Dwelling. While under the den, Mike thinks that it would make a great nursery. He also wants to know why Howard doesn't want kids. Howard denies it and figures that Bernie must have lied to him. Raj and Bernadette both hear the conversation from under the floor. She gets nervous, jumps up and down on the floor yelling \"Earthquake!\"Penny and Leonard are alone and she can't believe that Sheldon planned to propose. Sheldon returns saying that he feels better. They also conclude that his outburst will be in the film. Sheldon thinks that it's ridiculous to get that upset over the Amy situation. To resolve it, he's going to find her and propose so that they can continue their relationship.Bernadette tries to explain herself saying that she didn't want to disappoint him. Her Dad doesn't want her to miss the most rewarding experience of his life, but Bernie says that he did nothing around the house. Raj thinks it's interesting that neither her father nor Howard help around the house. Howard is like the child she is afraid to have.\nHoward proposes to work harder and to be a good father unlike his own who left. Bernadette says that she'll seriously think about having a baby.Sheldon is walking up to Amy's apartment building, and in the distance he sees Amy saying commonly used goodnight to David Gibbs. There is a quick kiss. Sheldon is devastated and leaves.Finally, Sheldon is watching an old TV Star Trek episode with Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock talking about Vulcans being unemotional.

Raj wants to know if he ever does anything for others. He is a giving and generous lover. Emily asks Bernadette if they are close enough for her to call that creepy. Bernadette says that they are, but the word is \"Yeech!\" The shift supervisor comes to the door and explains that they have enough help and to come back some other time. Bernadette swipes at Howard to get that smug look off his face. The supervisor returns saying that due to a cancellation, they could use the help. As the guys enter, Howard tells Bernadette to get that smug look off her face.Leonard and Penny are unloading the groceries for their first Thanksgiving together. Penny needs to look up the recipes on Leonard's IPad. The password is his birthday, but it doesn't work. Leonard tries it, gets in and realizes that Penny doesn't know his birthday.

The odds of letting her forget this is zero.Sheldon gets into Amy's car and they are both in good moods.

She preferred NSYNC. Leonard then claims to be the king of husbands.\nHe adds that she didn't like the orange lingerie he got her for Valentine's Day. Also she doesn't like the word \"moist\" because.. Hold on. That was only written in her journal which Leonard obviously read. Penny knows he is lying because his voice goes up an octave.Howard is washing dishes and claims that it's not so bad until he is told he has five hours and forty minutes to go. The supervisor asks for three volunteers to serve food. Everybody leaves Howard to go serve food leaving Howard with the dishes to do.Leonard is apologizing to Penny for reading her journal because it was an accident. He just found it on the night table. Penny goes back to working on her meal, while Leonard still wants to make it up to her. He starts reading from his journal from the day they met. She wants to hear something recent. Leonard about how their love is growing and Penny knows that he is making it up. It's really about his excitement over the new Star Wars movie.Sheldon thinks that things have gotten awkward, but Amy dismisses it saying that they are friends and should be able to discuss anything. How many dates has she been on? Who were they with? Where did they go? Where did she meet them? Did she sleep with them? How far is it to the aquarium? She has had six different dates with three different men and either went for coffee or to dinner. One she met at a bookstore and two she met online. She slept with none of them. And the aquarium is forty minutes away.As Howard is washing dishes, Elon Musk brings in a tray of dirty dishes which surprises Howard. He was serving turkey, but served too much gravy and got demoted to dishes. Howard tells him that he is a big fan of the Tesla car and his SpaceX rocket project.

Sheldon is glad that they can function together as friends. Amy calls Sheldon on the phone. She had a really nice time with him earlier. She says that maybe she is ready to be his girlfriend again.

She kind of promised Beverly that they would get married again the following weekend so they could do it in front of family and friends. Penny explained that his mother was really hurt for not getting an Wedding invitation. Leonard retorts that their wedding was a spur of the moment thing and that they really don't like his mom. Penny wants to keep it a small affair and that she can invite her whole family now that her brother is out of prison. Leonard would like to invite his dad. He's doing so much better since the divorce (no more twitches and he's an inch and a half taller).In the kitchen, Penny is explaining to the girls that they are having a renewal of their vows. Amy wants to know if she'll have a maid of honor. Penny asks Bernadette to officiate at the wedding, which causes Amy to complain that she is now just the lousy maid of honor. Sheldon comes in announcing that he has invited his mother to come, also adding that he invited Stephen Hawking, Robert Downey Jr., and Erno Rubik (inventor of the Rubik's Cube). Sheldon is putting himself into their relationship.\nIn Leonard's car, Beverly yells at Leonard for inviting his father Alfred Hofstadter (Judd Hirsch) without consulting her. Leonard feels that he can invite who he wants. Beverly reminds him that their marriage ended because he had an affair. Alfred called her cold, emasculating and not showing him any affection for years.Howard is working on their invention and realizes that the system is now maintaining its own Orbital stability and orientation. They have a working guidance system! As Raj congratulates him, Howard receives an email from the United States' Air Force. They are requesting a meeting to discuss their guidance system patent. Both of them wonder if they were being watched.Shamy has picked up Mary (Laurie Metcalf) from the airport. Mary was very happy that Leonard and Penny invited her. Leonard always had a special place in her heart since he always took care of her little baby. Sheldon insists that he took care of Leonard. \"Sure you did,\" replies Mary in a sarcastic tone. Amy tells her that Penny's family is coming the next day and that Beverly will be there which doesn't please Mary as she pulls out her cross necklace. Sheldon points out that she is an atheist not a vampire though Mary wants to get some garlic at the retail store anyway.In the apartment, Mary and Beverly are having some very awkward chit-chat. Amy thinks that the atmosphere is so chilly she can see her breath. Beverly says that they can hear them.Howard is in his kitchen complaining to Bernadette and Raj about being extremely naive. He thinks that the military will completely take over their project and that if anyone objects they will just Force disappear. According to Raj, the message was from the USAF acquisition agency and that maybe they want to buy it for a lot of money. But the military took over in \"Avatar\", \"E.T.\", \"Jurassic World\", etc. Bernie reminds him that those were not documentaries.Leonard and Alfred enter the lobby. Climbing the stairs, he hopes that he has a heart attack so he can avoid Beverly. He is still glad to have come and he feels that Penny is a real sweetie.Up in the apartment, the only sound is Penny and Amy crunching on some celery and chips. No conversation. Leonard and Alfred arrive and Penny goes up to him and hugs him. After Leonard re-introduces Alfred to Sheldon and introduces him to Mary and Amy for the first time, he then presents Beverly, to whom Alfred says \"Hello, my hateful shrew.\" She replies \"Hello to you, you wrinkled old bastard\". Penny invites everyone to dinnerHoward is still wondering whether they should respond to the email. Raj points out that the Air Force knows that he opened it. Bernadette wants them to head out to Leonard and Penny's dinner.Driving his mother to dinner, Beverly hopes that her example of a failed marriage will not discourage them. Of course not, replies Penny.\nMary and Alfred are getting to know each other. He says that he is an anthropologist who studies ancient cultures. \"All the way back to Genesis the flood?\" asks Mary. Although an agnostic, he does appreciate others' beliefs. He had often prayed to God to turn Beverly into a Lot's pillar of salt. Mary adds that he came close and turned into a block of ice. Both laugh.As Raj and Howard discuss who could help them on their drive to the restaurant, Bernadette tries to convince them that all their movies, television shows and comic books have twisted the way they are thinking. Then Howard notices a car that is following him. The car behind them is Leonard's and they decide to follow Howard since he might know a shortcut. Getting in closer freaks out Howard who makes a sudden turn and speeds up. Leonard continues to follow him fueling Howard and now even Bernadette's paranoia.At the restaurant, Alfred and Mary are getting to know each other. Leonard and company arrive as they mention Howard's strange behavior. Penny calls Bernadette. Bernie was relieved to learn it was Penny and Leonard following them. They have gotten pulled over and Howard was being given a sobriety test after ranting that the government is after him.Back at the restaurant, Mary and Alfred are talking. Mary compliments Leonard on his father's charm. Leonard toasts Penny thanking her for a wonderful year of marriage, and for saying yes when he asked her to marry him. Penny thanks him for continuing to ask until she says yes and they kiss. Alfred also makes a toast that he is happy that Leonard has found a woman that loves and cares for him. Beverly squawks as to what the hell he means by that. And they begin arguing with Alfred telling Beverly to take a pill and she replies \"Like you did before sex?\" He answers \"What I really needed was a blindfold\".\nMary tells everyone to calm down and remember what it says in the Bible: \"He who is slow to anger is better than the mighty.\". Alfred decides to call it an early night as does Mary. When they find out they are staying at the same hotel, they both decide to share a cab. Penny and Amy see what happened, while Sheldon just thinks that they filled up on bread.Sheldon tries calling his mother and Leonard tries texting his father, but neither respond, which worries them. Penny laughs saying they turned their phones off. Sheldon and Leonard are quite disturbed at what is being suggested. Are Leonard and Sheldon going to become step-brothers?Title reference: Everyone converging on the dinner before Leonard and Penny's second wedding ceremony.", "episode_22": "While fixing dinner, Penny tells them that she won a night of wine tasting at work. Leonard wonders why scientists don't win things. Howard claims that they are in it for the groupies. Sheldon claims that he just pursues science for the intrinsic joy of discovery. Amy reminds him that he always says that he wants to win a Nobel Prize. Howard, Amy, Raj and Leonard plan on going; however, Bernadette is pregnant and Sheldon has had enough of wine. Sheldon then tells Bernadette that it'll just be the two of them. Sheldon wanted her to join him and explained that all the things she has to avoid, he never liked in the first place.Working on their invention, the infinite persistence gyroscope navigation system, in the Mechanical Engineering Lab, Raj wonders if he can bring Claire. Leonard wondered if he was still dating Emily. Raj concurs and says that he is keeping the two casual relationships casual. Howard is ready to start up their gyroscope while Sheldon documents it on video. The three rotating rings start up successfully. Raj thinks it looks beautiful, while it makes Howard and Leonard dizzy.Raj calls up Claire and invites her to the winery. She is fine with it as long as meeting his friends is not too big a step. Claire wants to know if she'll be introduced as his girlfriend.Leonard is reading a scratch-and-sniff book about wine tasting. Leonard can't really smell anything because his sinuses are acting up. Sheldon tells Penny that he is going to prove that you can have fun without alcohol, tobacco, caffeine, sushi, soft cheese, processed meats, Jacuzzi's or anything else that is harmful to a pregnant lady.At the wine tasting, Howard and Amy are the first to arrive. At first they are nervous with nothing to say; then they remember the last time they were together. It was three years ago during the scavenger hunt. Leonard, Penny and Raj show up. Claire is going to meet them there and Raj doesn't want them to ask too many questions since they are keeping it casual. Leonard then won't ask her about how it is being in his harem. Amy then notices Zack (Brian Thomas Smith), Penny's old boyfriend. Raj wants her to ask who was better in the sack.Bernadette shows up with some bubbly apple cider which unfortunately tickles Sheldon's nose. Sheldon has a fetus friendly festival of fun discussing trains and types of toast that thrills Bernadette.The guys are describing what they smell in the wine, except for stopped-up Leonard. Zack comes by to say hello. He sees that they are married and wonders if it's to each other. Despite breaking up with Leonard and despite her coming back to Zack, he was always rooting for them. The guys tell Zack about their navigational system and he wonders if it could be misused by the military. Zack then asks if it's better than the one they're using now. \"Yea!\" they exclaim as they realize that the military would want itSheldon is describing the various model train gauge scales. The smallest gauge railroad engine he accidentally swallowed and had to pass. Bernie wondered why he liked trains. Life was confusing when he was young and trains represented order. He could line them up, categorize them, etc. They gave Sheldon a sense of calm in a world that did not.Leonard is telling Howard that he is worried about the military applications ever since Zack mentioned it. Amy cites Einstein's theory and the development of the atomic bomb. Claire then joins them and is introduced as a casual friend who needs no other questions. Leonard asks her if she would like some wine. Raj shouts that he said no questions.Now Sheldon has laid out all the different types of toast including Star Wars toast. It has a light side and a \"dark side\". Next on the evening's agenda is D & D. Bernadette says that she might play for a little while. Sheldon doesn't think that she will want to stop or will be allowed to. The game was designed for her. Her character's name is Bernadetrix, a tall brave warrior queen. She likes being tall. Also only the men get pregnant in this universe. She thinks it might be fun. She starts out having a drink at the tavern. Bernadette says that she storms into the tavern, throws down her sword and wants his strongest ale in the skull of a goblin.Penny tells Claire that they have heard nothing, but good things about her. Claire stumps them by asking what they had heard. Zack comes over and then hits on Claire. Zack asks why she was introduced as his friend since she is so great. Claire says that she doesn't know, so Zack then asks Raj who is stumped. Leonard is still worried about their project and wants to take another look at it. Howard doesn't want to stop because he needs the money. How do they know that their invention is not going to be used to destroy the world? Howard retorts that no one has come back from the future to kill them.Back at D&D, Bernadette is killing the ogre that attacked her. After being in a hot spring, the ogre is reduced to sushi and begs to be eaten. Bernadette enjoys the sushi, bathes in the hot spring and does not have swollen ankles. The end. She thanks him since for one night she didn't have to be \"pregnant Bernadette\". Sheldon tells her that if she ever needs another break, Bernadetrix the Warrior is there for her.Raj asks Zack to not come onto Claire since he is bigger and more handsome. Raj doesn't want him to talk about how great Claire is. Claire then asks Penny and Amy if he brings around other girls. The girls are stumped. Leonard calls Raj loyal to a fault. Zack comes over and tells everyone that Raj is right that Claire is not so great. Raj counters that he says crazy things all the time. So what had they been talking about while he was gone? Claire tells him that they were discussing all of the girls he had been dating. Raj complains that he didn't want them to mention that. Penny tells him that they didn't, he did.Leonard wakes up, walks into the kitchen and tells Sheldon that he overdid it that previous night. Sheldon did too, but it was making too much toast. Leonard then inquires if Sheldon has ever thought about the military applications. It first bothered him and then he talked to Alicia and Fred about it and they put it into perspective. Sheldon tells him that friends are like toilet paper since it's always good to have a couple of extra under the sink.Title reference: The group separates into two branches because of the wine tasting trip.", "episode_4": "Leonard, Penny and Sheldon are returning from the container store with an extremely happy Sheldon until he notices them taking his new bin to Penny's apartment. Penny tells Sheldon that since they are married it makes sense for Leonard and her to be living together. Sheldon gets upset claiming that the whole wonderful day was to deliver bad news to him.Sheldon is visiting Bernadette to seek female comfort and encouragement about Leonard moving out to live with Penny since his relationship with Amy is strained. Bernadette was honored that he turned to her until she found out she was picked after his mother, Leonard's mother and his Meemaw were unavailable making her seventh. Sheldon is feeling abandoned so Bernadette suggests that this is an opportunity to find a new roommate since he has had others in the past. Sheldon muses that maybe he could get Chris Pratt. Bernadette then suggests that he take Stuart as his roommate; however, Stuart says that he is much too happy living with them.Stuart, Raj and Howard are hanging out at the comic book store and Raj finds a comic book where Archie is taking on Predator. Stuart asks if the guys know any musicians since he would like to have live music in the comic book store a few times a week giving the place a \"staying in business\" vibe. Raj and Howard have always wanted to play together. Raj wants to play folk music, a mixture of folk and sci-fi themes. Howard likes the idea and even has a band name he has been holding since middle school - \"Footprints on the Moon''.Sheldon and Leonard are going over the paperwork to officially 'unroommate' him. Leonard has to return his apartment key and then as his new neighbor Leonard gets an apartment key. Also he signs up for the ten year roommate reunion and turns ownership of the couch over to Sheldon in every parallel universe. Leonard signs out of annoyance.Raj and Howard are working on their folk song. Raj suggests a David and Goliath story where the Norse god Thor goes up against Indiana Jones. The hammer versus the whip which blows Howard's mind. \"Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays with lightning and the other plays with bones.\"Sheldon starts to interview new roommate applicants and asks the chemist which element on the periodic table is too big for its britches. The answer is argon. The next candidate is asked if on average his Odor smells better or worse than he does at the present time. The next one is dismissed because he has a Band-Aid on his arm. Up next, he describes the candidate as being healthy and in the sciences, though he is running a credit check. He is on Skype with Amy who is not going to be his roommate. Eleven people have walked out on him. Sheldon blames Leonard, Penny and Amy with poisoning him with emotions. He's like the Tin Man who was given a heart by the wicked wizard.Penny and Leonard are going out to eat and Leonard suggests the usual weekly Thai food. Penny tells him that he can choose anything he wants since he no longer lives with Sheldon. He goes through a dozen possible cuisines and finds himself most comfortable with Thai food. They run into Sheldon in the lobby who has reset himself to his 2003 self. He is too emotionally vulnerable and is going back to his last stable version like any operating system before he met Leonard and had to deal with emotions. Therefore, he doesn't know who they are since he hasn't met them and they must exit the premises before he calls the police on his new stylish flip-phone.At dinner, Leonard is still worried about Sheldon. Penny explains that he is fine and is just a man in his 30's living like he is a man in his 20's. Leonard can set the thermostat to whatever temperature he wants and go to the bathroom at any time. He still feels like they are abandoning him though he can still be contacted on Facebook once they invent the iPhone in his universe.Bernadette and Amy are having a drink with Amy saying that she can't believe Sheldon ran a credit check on her. Bernadette offers her a $1000 bill, to take in Stuart if she is looking for a roommate. Amy declines.Penny and Leonard visit the apartment which is now empty except for two lawn chairs, the TV on cinder blocks and a giant cable reel for a table just as Leonard found it when he first met Sheldon. It is now 2003. Everything has been moved into the spare bedroom. Sheldon is dealing with everyone abandoning him. Leonard tells him that they are just across the hall. \"Talk to the hand\" replies Sheldon to Penny who says that people don't say that now or in 2003.Raj plays the song for Emily who thinks that it is cute, but that she likes music that people can dance to. Raj tries to dance to it and then tells Howard the problem. Howard insists that their group does songs that make people think. Finally Howard realized that Raj played it for Emily and he was asking her comments. Howard accuses her of breaking up the band, quits himself and orders Raj out of his house. Raj storms out, but they quickly reunite.Leonard and Penny have brought over dinner with Penny telling him that it seems like a big change, but it isn't. Sheldon disagrees and says that Amy is gone and soon they will be. They'll buy a house and instead of getting together a couple times a week, they will get together a couple times a month, and mainly for special occasions \"Like when Howard and Bernadette divorce, or when Raj's creepy girlfriend finally tells where she hid his body or at Amy's wedding when she is marrying someone better than me.\"After that Penny feels bad and then agrees that they won't change things that much and they will stay at his place. At least half the time, adds Sheldon to which Penny agrees to Leonard's confusion. Sheldon is going to be like their dog which is fine with Sheldon who runs off to create a revised roommate agreement.The gang (except Amy) is at the comic book store listening to Howard and Raj. Everybody is polite and acting like they are enjoying the music. When the song ends, Stuart asks if they could play something that they could dance to.Title reference: Sheldon resets his life and his apartment back to 2003 when he was happier and unemotional before he met Leonard.", "episode_3": "While Sheldon and Leonard are fixing lunch in Apartment 4A, Leonard offers up a fun fact about mustard although Sheldon already knows about its component that can be used to ward off caterpillars. Raj and Howard enter, they are going to kidnap Leonard and take him to an unknown destination to celebrate his bachelor party. Sheldon complains that their kidnapping is missing a blindfold, Duct tape and a ransom call.. Penny already packed his bag AND Sheldon is coming too. He asks how they are going to make him come, so they kidnap him; rope and blindfold included.Driving down the Interstate highway, Sheldon is again complaining about being taken against his will into a hippie's mobile sex dungeon. The van they are using once belonged to Richard Feynman, one of Sheldon's favorite physicists. Both Sheldon and Leonard get excited. According to Howard they are heading to Meh-i-co. Raj wonders what problems he has with where they're going. Mariachi bands, wild dogs and Mexican jumping beans with little worms in them that jump around. The theme of the trip is to go to Mexico in Richard Feynman's van to stay in the house that Richard Feynman's house bought with the money he was given for his Nobel Prize. \"Viva la Imodium\", shouts Sheldon.In apartment 4B, Bernadette is trying to get Penny to go to a strip club since the boys are off on a bachelor weekend. Amy joins them, bringing some cookies for the mini-hens party. The cookies are shaped like penises with gummy worms for veins, circumcised and uncircumcised. Penny tells the world to watch their daughters or Sheldon may spend the night explaining NAFTA to them which did happen to Amy.Sheldon finds out the limits that US Customs have on returning with DVDs, CDs and VHS tapes. There could be some VHS tapes leftover in a van that old. Especially Jane Fonda workout tapes.The girls discussed married life with Penny who has a husband who has not yet moved out of his apartment. He does sleep there at night; however, it is only time before Sheldon has a nightmare and finds the pile of pillows in Leonard's bed.Penny tells Amy that it's not uncommon for a woman to get a makeover after a breakup. Amy is considering maybe changing one thing. Your glasses. Your sweater. Your hair. Your shoes. No, she wants her ears pierced. She never got it done because her mother thought that it was for whores, pirates and genies. Amy wants to get it done elsewhere, but Penny can do it with a needle and an ice cube. Penny begs her that she will be gentle and to let her take her ear virginity.On their way to Mexico, Sheldon tells Howard to watch his speed since Mexican police have it in for tourists. Leonard compares that it's like riding around in the Batmobile if Batman was a physicist. They all hope that Feynman's Mojo will rub off on them, inspiring them to greatness. Suddenly they get a flat tire and Sheldon is worried that they are being shot at by bandits and may end up in a Mexican factory making Bart Simpson pinatas. Sheldon then again says that he is getting too old for this crud.Their van has a flat tire and Howard is trying to fix it. He learned that skill so that he could change the tires of damsels in distress (Meet women). Sheldon is trying to find and stay away from scorpions. Howard can't get the last lug nut off. Raj wonders if he is turning it the right way and tries it himself. It doesn't turn the opposite way.While Penny finishes up with Amy's ears, Bernadette notes that Amy hasn't changed her Facebook status. Amy agrees that she should let her Facebook friends know that. Penny hasn't yet changed hers since she hasn't yet told her parents that she is married. Her father wanted a father/daughter dance at her wedding. He didn't get to do it at her sister's wedding because her water broke when they started. Penny figures her Dad isn't getting any younger so she'll just wait until he cannot remember things and she'll tell him that it was magical.As Amy admires her pierced ears, she remarks that if her mother saw her now she would lock her in \"The Sin Closet\". Bernadette adds that at least she would have told her if she had gotten married. Penny agrees to call them. They both think that Amy has told her mother about Sheldon, but she hasn't. Penny insists she call home and tell her family that she broke up with Sheldon. She calls her Dad and tells him that she married Leonard last week on the spur of the moment and is sorry that she didn't tell him. He is glad that she is happy. Penny calls him the best Dad ever. He replies for her to hold that thought. Her father accidentally ran over her pet pig Moondance with the tractor's new rototiller ten to twelve months ago. And he didn't tell Penny for a whole year?All the guys are pushing on the lug trying to turn it. Raj is doing LaMaze breathing to help push. Howard figures that he is pushing with his uterus. Leonard just considers this a physics problem. Sheldon quotes Archimedes where if he had a long enough lever, he could move the world.Penny sarcastically reprimands the girls for making her make the call because previously, in her mind, her pet pig was alive and rolling around in the mud. Now it's illegally buried in the backyard next to her great-grandmother. Now it's Amy's turn. First Amy fakes trying to dial and then she gets her mother, but makes stalling with small talk, Penny grabs the phone and tells her Mom about Sheldon, the ear piercing and the \"penis cookies.\" Penny then hands back the phone because her mother wants to talk to her.Still working on the lug nut, Howard is hanging from a lever made out of a stop sign and pole. Then they muse about Star Trek Phasers, Superman's heat vision, Green Lantern's ring and The Incredible Hulk, who might not get across the border with his temper. Leonard tells them that they are scientists and should be able to use real science.\nPercussive shock, they keep hammering at the lug with the rhythm inspiring them to sing \"We Will Rock You\". Sheldon gets excited and breaks into a tenor doing the refrain.\nThermal expansion, they try to heat up the lug with a tortilla chip. Sheldon is afraid the cooking chip would attract animals.\nAccelerated corrosion, using burning salsa and two electrodes, he hopes to corrode it off. Sheldon considers his idea innovative and doesn't feel he gives his M.I.T. education enough credit. Howard saw it on \"MythBusters\".\nExothermic Reaction, using rust and aluminum they make some Thermite to melt it off. Howard says that the lug nut put up a good fight, but \"met its match\" as he lights the match. Next, they are standing next to the van in glorious flames. Raj notes that the lug nut is finally off.Finally a filthy Sheldon and Leonard and coming up the staircase they meet Penny going down with their laundry. Leonard mentions that they had a flat and couldn't get it off. Penny mentions that she pierced Amy's ears and her mother had Amy sit in Penny's closet. Sheldon told her that they blew up the van. Penny's pig was killed by her father's tractor. Leonard says that he had to spend the weekend in Mexico with Sheldon. Penny tells Leonard that he wins.Title reference: The men's bachelor party plans being ruined by the corroded bolt holding the flat tire.", "episode_23": "Penny and Sheldon are on the couch with flashcards trying to expand their respective knowledge bases. Penny has celebrity pictures and Sheldon has scientific terms. Leonard asks Penny to go with him to the airport to pick up his mother. Penny agrees to join him. Leonard then asks her since she will already be at the airport, could she pick her up? It would give her a chance to bond with her and Leonard wouldn't be subjected to her criticism (which he gets more than enough of from Sheldon).At the comic book store the guys are discussing the screening of Captain America: Civil War movie that includes deleted scenes on a first-come first-served basis. Joss Whedon will be having a Q&A. The guys plan on getting in line early. Beverly is busy with Penny; however, Sheldon has to go shopping with Amy. The boys offer to hold him a space in line because they refuse to let Sheldon stop them from attending; however, Sheldon feels that that violates line etiquette. Howard mentions that he could hire someone to stand in line for him. Stuart thinks that is pathetic until he finds they can make $20 an hour and suddenly wants to do it himself.Leaving the airport, Beverly (Christine Baranski) is not surprised that Leonard avoided her and is asking Penny about their sex life before they leave the parking lot. Penny changes the subject to talking to each other about the latest books they had read, but her last one was a Pottery Barn catalog. \"Don't psychoanalyze everything I say.\"Stuart gets into the car with Amy. Amy remarks that he is not Sheldon. Sheldon has paid him to go shopping with her. Amy says that they are not going to do that and she is very annoyed.At the movies, the guys reminisce about previous lines they had waited in. Stuart shows up and calls Sheldon the most inconsiderate man he has met in his entire life. Amy hired him to yell at Sheldon. Sheldon tells him that turnabout is fair play.Amy is complaining about the progress she thought she was making with Sheldon. Beverly knows how brilliant Sheldon is and that being in a relationship could be trying. She admires Amy's resolve and tells her that she is an extraordinary woman. Stuart arrives with flowers and an apology that Sheldon paid for. Amy offers Bernadette five dollars to slam the door in his face (Stuart states that he would've done it for three dollars).Stuart returns to the theater and tells Sheldon that his apology was not accepted. Leonard suggests that Sheldon apologize in person. Stuart offers to hold Sheldon's place in line for a price and Sheldon leaves to do so.Bernadette tries to talk Penny up, mentioning her status as the number three salesperson at their pharmaceutical company. She mentions that she is a microbiologist and her work with some new anti-anxiety drugs that all three scientists find interesting. On Bernadette's urging Penny had mentioned something great about her new company car. It has seat warmers. Sheldon then shows up at the apartment and gives Amy a specific three part apology. Amy replies, \"Fine\". Sheldon has to leave because he has an Uber car downstairs.Leonard and Howard are making fun of Raj and the cane seat he's using. Sheldon rushes back out of breath explaining that his apology went fine. Stuart is then relieved of his duties. A young man runs up and joins his friends in front of Sheldon. Leonard tells Sheldon to let it be. Sheldon confronts the interloper, who says that his friends saved him a place. After Sheldon rants about line etiquette, the guy wants to know who made him line monitor. Mrs. Wunch in the fourth grade.Beverly is impressed with their relationship and wants to interview them for a new book she is writing about high achieving couples. Amy mentions that Bernadette is married to an ex-astronaut. Would they like to be interviewed? Sure. Bernadette says that she should talk to Penny too. \"About what?\" replies Beverly. Now, this is the last straw for Penny, who has now had enough and is now extremely angry with Beverly since she has been trying to connect with her all day. Penny then says that she was seeking some sort of friendship and that Penny will take Beverly not insulting her to her face. Does she even know what an insult is? Beverly tells her it's not a clinical term, but an example is like when Penny married her son without inviting her or even telling her the wedding was taking place. Penny is stumped and tells her that that is a good example.Now, Sheldon is arguing with the guy about line-cutting and the rules that the Avengers live by. Then he asks the rest of the line behind him whether they take issue with this guy's line-cutting. No one does. Sheldon then claims that someone at the back of the line is not getting in because of him. An African-American woman reminds Sheldon that he had paid Stuart to hold his place in line, so he cut. But to Sheldon his circumstance was \"swapsies\" and not \"cutsies\".Penny tells Beverly that she is surprised that she even cared about the wedding. Beverly said that she is still human and wanted to get an invitation to her own son's wedding. Amy tells her that she knows how Beverly feels since none of them knew since Penny didn't invite either of them. Penny says it was spur-of-the-moment. Bernadette mentions the live-streaming of the wedding. Penny asked Beverly if she would have come. Beverly replied in the negative and would have told her that she was making a big mistake. Penny is crushed and asks if she really thinks they made a mistake. She did at the time, but Beverly has never seen Leonard so happy, so maybe she was the one who was mistaken. \"Wow\", replied Penny who then proposed that they get married again in front of her and their friends while Beverly was in town. Beverly finds that perfectly acceptable. Penny exclaims joyfully that she would find that \"perfectly acceptable\" and that they have bonded.Finally, Bernadette is getting ready for bed and asks him if he was okay since he'd been in the bathroom a while. He's fine. As Bernadette leaves the bedroom, she smiles listening to Howard interview himself.Title reference: Sheldon hires Stuart to hold his place in line while he apologizes to Amy.", "episode_20": "Viewing a beautiful forest scene, Sheldon comments about the beauty of nature and how he should do this more often. He is using his virtual reality simulator while in Apartment 4A. Penny asks what was going on. Sheldon explains about his virtual simulation and was using a pine scented car air freshener to give him the smell of the forest. Amy found a study that those that spend time outside increase the reasoning abilities. Leonard says he will be happy to leave him in the wilderness at any time.Still in his virtual forest, Amy brings Sheldon some tea. Amy tells him that if he really wants to be out in nature, they could rent a cabin. Penny has a client who has offered her a cabin at Big Bear Lake. Leonard and Penny decide to spend the weekend there. Sheldon wants them to say hello to all the mosquitoes, bees, bears, snakes, possums, poison oak and teenagers with guitars. Amy points out that if the study is right, Leonard could come back smarter than Sheldon. Now he wants to go.While Howard is playing a video game, Raj is carrying in all of the grocery bags for the pregnant Bernadette. She thinks it was sweet that Raj is making such a fuss over her.

Leonard thought the last video store they saw looked like Colonial Williamsburg.Howard sees that Raj has pulled up and he wants to talk to him. Bernadette asks that he leave Raj alone. She feels that he is just being supportive and is not acting over-the-top. Raj then walks in with a teddy bear at least seven feet high and wider than the door.\nThe two couples arrive at the cabin. Amy remarks that it was so nice of the doctor to let them use it. Penny replied that she also has to go to an Indigo Girls concert with her.Amy and Penny look out the window at the downpour of rain and note that their hike is definitely canceled. They could kill their time with some board games, but Sheldon already checked that the games have too many missing pieces. Penny wants to light a fire. As Sheldon and Leonard consider the best scientific way of building a fire, Penny turns on the gas. Instant fire.Bernadette and Howard are having a serious talk with Raj. They appreciate his enthusiasm, but they feel they should set some boundaries. The three of them are not having the baby, just the two of them. Raj now understands and is happily going to back off to give them some space. He then struggles with the bear to get it out of the house, knocking over everything.Later at the cabin, the couples are having some wine. Penny proposes a drinking game. The game is \"Never Have I Ever\". One person says something that they haven't done and then the others have to take a sip if they have. Leonard says that he has never been arrested. Sheldon takes a drink. He was arrested for jaywalking, but only after he kept pointing out to the policeman that he wasn't doing his job in an annoying Sheldon-fashion.Bernadette is getting upset feeling that they made a horrible mistake. Bernie breaks into tears. Was it being sad or pregnancy hormones? Howard goes to get Raj. And Bernadette wants him to bring back the bear.Leonard thinks that their game could get dangerous. \"How?\" asks Penny. Leonard says that he never used Sheldon's toothbrush to wash out the sink. Sheldon gets upset. Penny takes a drink. Fine. Penny never gave a nickname to her genitals. Leonard takes a drink. FYI: Alvin and the Chipmunks. Amy adds that never has she ever rocked her girlfriend in bed. Sheldon takes a drink. Penny tells Leonard that he can take a drink. Sheldon says that never has he ever kept a secret bank account without telling his wife because he doesn't think she can handle money. Penny can't believe Leonard. Penny insists that married couples should share everything. Leonard then mentions Penny's massive credit card debt which drives her out of the room.Coming out of the dining room, Raj says that he appreciates the apology. Howard says that he should do more himself. Raj asks if there is anything he can do. Howard tells him to go get the fetal heart monitor and he can listen to the baby's heartbeat with them. Raj wants to squirt the ultrasound gel on Bernadette's stomach.Penny is pacing the bedroom. Leonard comes in and apologizes for keeping the money a secret. He has just been keeping a bit aside for emergencies. $6427. Leonard reminds her of all the shoes she has that she loves and doesn't wear. He has money he loves and never spends. Penny also has a secret. She hates her job, having to flirt with doctors all day to just make sales. She also knows how important it is to him for her to be a success. Leonard is willing to support her whatever she wants to do. Her job is getting her out of debt and she is going to continue doing the grownup thing. Leonard agrees that it is the grownup thing and they say they love each other and kiss.Howard gets ready to use the ultrasonic fetal Doppler and keeps trying to find the baby's heartbeat. They all gasp when they hear the heart thumping. Bernadette is excited while Raj says that they made a little person.Finally Sheldon and Amy are in front of the fire still playing the game. Sheldon never drank milk past the expiration date. Amy never canceled a dentist appointment. Sheldon never put his foot in the ocean. Amy never honked just because she liked something. Sheldon never played or even touched a Frisbee. Amy never put salt on her food before at least tasting it. Sheldon never pushed all the buttons in an elevator. Amy takes a drink with a devilish look on her face. Amy then shrugs, puts her glass down and says, \"Everyone has a past.\"Title reference: Rain disrupting the group's weekend plans at a cabin in Big Bear, as well as Raj buying Howard and Bernadette a large teddy bear to celebrate their pregnancy.", "episode_6": "Sheldon enters Leonard's laboratory with some bad news. A team of Swedish physicists are trying to scoop up their Superfluid Vortex theory. To beat the Swedes, they have to perform their experiment to demonstrate the theory's viability immediately, but the liquid helium they need won't be available for a month.The guys visit Barry Kripke to see if the university had any liquid helium in reserve. Barry explains that there is a shortage and he needs it for his quantum excitation experiment. Leonard mentions the urgency due to the Swede's work, but Barry asks him honestly whether they would do the same for him. Sheldon is honest and says no. Leonard asks Barry if he'll help them out. \"Hell no!\" is his response.As all the guys return to Leonard's laboratory, Raj suggests that they go to Party City, but they would have to visit every store in California. Howard knows a guy who can help them as long as they don't ask too many questions. Both Leonard and Sheldon start inquiring about who, where and how many questions they can ask.Penny and Bernadette are having coffee in her living room and she says that Stuart went out on a date. Penny wants to know if she's homeless or framing him for a crime. He found her using an app that identifies the women within a five-mile radius that are also looking, and that it's sort of like a game. He has met two girls using it.Sheldon and Leonard are in Sheldon's apartment and Leonard has heard from their helium source. Sheldon doesn't want to go out because he doesn't like to go shopping at night. Leonard just wants to bend the rules to get it done especially since they have the grant money specifically for this experiment. Dr. Goldfarb had used his grant money for his electron microscope to support his Russian girlfriend in Van Nuys.Stuart downloads the app onto Amy's phone. She isn't sure about doing this. Penny takes the phone from him and quickly swipes thumbs down to three different guys. Raj and Howard return because Bernadette hadn't given Howard much spending money. Then Raj takes the phone and swipes no to every guy he see's on it too including the Indian guy because their Social Group already has one. He wants to find her a nice Latino guy to complement their ethnicity.Leonard and Sheldon pull up in a rented truck in a parking garage and see a guy next to a nondescript white-paneled van. Leonard introduces himself and Sheldon claims to be Skippy Cavanaugh. He wants the helium first. The guy says that they could do the same thing. They both agree that they appear to be sketchy characters in a parking garage. The guy says that they appear to be at a stalemate. A stalemate implies no more moves. He could steal their money, kill them, etc. Leonard is feeling uncomfortable. The guy feels foolish since what he meant was an impasse. Leonard calls it a Mexican stand-off creating another semantic debate. Sheldon gives him a hypothetical situation, noting he found the guy's name (Kenneth Fitzgerald (Michael Rapaport)) and address and if he reneged on his agreement he could report him to the authorities. The guy wants to back out. Sheldon asks Leonard if again he has won the battle, but lost the war.Next Leonard wants everyone to calm down. Leonard explains that they had been working on a theory for over a year. The guy wants to hear about it. Space-time can be interpreted as being on the surface of an n-dimensional super-fluid. Leonard continues and tells him about the Swedes. Their supplier was expecting a higher ethical standard from the Swedes as he illegally sells them the helium. Leonard laments that stealing other's work is rather common in their field and there's not much he can do about it. The guy replies that for the right amount of money, there are things you can do about it.The rest of the gang is hanging around Howard/Bernadette's house. They set up a system where they can look at the men through the television and can choose which guys they want to pick for Amy. The first guy that appears is crossed-eyed. The next guy has small eye teeth and looks like a dolphin. Stuart pops up on the screen and they ask him to leave the room.Returning to Leonard's laboratory, they are wheeling in the helium tank which is dressed in a coat and hat and Sheldon calls him \"Uncle Harvey\". Sheldon wants him to be inconspicuous. He still has problems with what they're doing. Will the supplier rat on them? Will Kripke wonder where we got the helium? What if they check his family tree and find no \"Uncle Harvey\"? They find a torn sticker on the metal container that says \"Property of U....\". Leonard figures it's USC or UCLA. Sheldon is worried that it belongs to the United States' government, which means federal prison time. Next they are seen taking Uncle Harvey back down the corridor and out the building.Penny has now set up a drinking game while checking out the guys on the app. One drink if he is shirtless, two if he poses with his pet, chug if both. Guy with no shirt and pet comes up. Bottoms up. Amy then gets a text, which also appears on the television screen. Some guy named David Gibbs (Stephen Merchant) enjoyed their date.Sheldon and Leonard are back in the garage. Ken doesn't mind returning because his daughter is having a sleepover and he can take only so much Katy Perry. He's willing to take the helium off their hands, but won't return their money. And there is a restocking fee. Sheldon asks how much since he only has $1000. That's the fee exactly.Penny tells Amy that she can't believe she started dating without telling her. She has met three guys for coffee.Again back in Leonard's lab, Sheldon figures that the Swedes will beat them, but at least they will not get \"gang-noogied\" in prison. \"Ernest Goes to Jail\" is the only prison movie he's seen and it scared Sheldon straight. Barry Kripke joins them and he is willing to give them his helium as long as they add his name to their paper.\nSheldon thinks that is preposterous, but they can't do it without him. They don't like being extorted especially by Barry Kripke, but what other choice do they have? They go back and repurchase the black market helium.Finally they are back in the apartment still debating what a \"Mexican standoff\" is and watching \"Ernest Goes to Jail\" with Ken. Sheldon insists that this will change the guy's life course. He admits that he is open to change.Title reference: Sheldon and Leonard do not have enough helium on hand to perform their experiment.", "episode_18": "Sheldon, Leonard, and Howard are patiently waiting to talk to the patent attorney to get a patent on their gyroscope idea from \"The Positive Negative Reaction.\" Howard wonders why Sheldon is wearing a bow tie. He wants to make a good impression. The guys are invited in. All their paperwork is in order and the legal team needs to look for other overlapping patents. They start musing about what they are going to do with their royalties and they learn that the university will get 75% of the total proceeds from their idea. On top of that, since Howard is a federal employee on loan from NASA, he'll get nothing. The lawyer tells him that he might get a plaque. Sheldon exclaims that that isn't fair. They should all get plaques. Leonard thanks him for his time and they leave the office without applying. Sheldon still wants to know about the plaque.The girls are hanging out at Leonard and Penny's apartment talking about Bernadette's pregnancy. She has had a little morning sickness and an increased sense of smell. She found where Howard hid the Girl Scout cookies. Raj shows up with a gift he received from Emily (Laura Spencer) sent to him after Valentine's Day. The girls think that she is trying to manipulate him. He's unsure if he should open it especially if it's something vindictive or dangerous. Penny has Bernadette sniff it and she detects some machine oil. In the box Raj finds an antique sextant used by sailors to navigate by the stars. Bernadette thinks that it is the perfect gift for an astrophysicist. Raj replies that he has too much self-esteem to let her get him back through a guilt trip. Amy quips that she doesn't have to be pregnant to smell that load of crap.Howard looks at the university's website and finds out that they can't patent it themselves. The university has rights to anything they develop as long as they are employed there. Sheldon is bummed that they get a part of his T-shirt and mug ideas. Leonard offers to at least split their 25% three ways. Sheldon gets very excited about getting to write up their deal in a contract. Leonard once found a stash of contracts under Sheldon's bed and found the whole situation weird.Examining the sextant, Amy checks the Internet and finds that it may have cost at least $500. Penny is sure that she is trying to get back together with him. Raj admits that he is easy to manipulate. Emily then calls him. The posse tells him to be strong. Emily wonders if he got the gift and if they could still be friends. Then Emily asks him to meet her for coffee. Raj hesitates as the girls do a lot of whispering between themselves. Emily ups the level by saying that she misses hanging out with him and that he lost her best friend. She wants him to come over as the girls shake their heads no. She also is having a really hard time which causes Penny to gag. They say goodbye and the girls tell him that he showed strength. As Raj leaves Penny tells him to say \"hi\" to Emily. \"Will do\" he says.Howard is reviewing Sheldon's contract and is happy with it. The girls come over to Sheldon and Leonard's, because Bernadette is tired and wants to go home. They learn about the contract and how the guys want to split up the royalties. Bernadette wants a lawyer to look it over. Howard is just happy that they found a way not to leave him out. Leonard mentions that everyone did contribute. Bernie tells him to go ahead and sign it if he wants to. The Wolowitzes adjourn to the hallway. Bernadette explains to Howard that he is about to sign a legal partnership with Sheldon Cooper. She doesn't want to spend the rest of her gestation hearing her husband complain how Sheldon is driving him even more crazy than usual. Anything they ever worked on together did not come out well.Raj is driving to Emily's when he gets a call from Claire. She says that she broke up with her boyfriend. Raj is interested, but admits that he's going to see Emily. Claire then asks if Emily said that she feels like she lost her best friend. Claire states \"That is page one of the girl's playbook\". Raj wants her to send him a copy of it.Returning, Howard explains that they are concerned about the partnership, so Sheldon suggests a limited liability corporation. Howard is more concerned with how Sheldon treats him. Penny suggests that they include a clause that Sheldon cannot make fun of Howard. That was fine with Sheldon who will follow the clause to the letter of the law. Amy adds and also because of his obsessive-compulsive disorder. The Wolwoitzes agree. Sheldon gets excited that now he gets to write an addendum.Emily calls and Raj tells her that it's not the best time to come over. He explains he's being manipulated. Raj calls Emily to say he isn't coming. Emily breaks into tears, so Raj calls Claire to change his plans. She again quotes Emily's line. He calls back Emily who again changes his mind and Claire tells him that she is manipulating him.The whole gang is reviewing the contract. Sheldon agrees to not mock Howard and his profession, hair cut, clothing or his love of the \"Ghost Rider\" movie. Also Sheldon donates one quarter of his profits to a college fund for the baby. Sheldon has always valued education over money and he realized how dismissive he had been of Howard's contribution. And he hopes that his efforts will rescue the child from the sub-par profession of being an engineer. Amy yells at Sheldon for his comment; however, Sheldon had not yet signed the contract.Finally, Claire is telling him that she knows how this is going to play out and to have a good life. Raj insists that they are just going to talk. They end up in bed together with Raj exclaiming, \"Good talk.\"Title reference: The men being shocked that, to apply for a patent, they must give up most of their profits.", "episode_17": "Sheldon, Amy, Leonard and Penny are descending the staircase and Amy wants to ask Sheldon that since they never let him celebrate his birthday, that this year they could. Sheldon agrees that that is a discussion they could have and then he disappears up the stairs.Entering the apartment Penny wonders where Sheldon is. As Leonard goes off to check his room, Sheldon jumps out from behind the couch and shouts \"Surprise!\" scaring them. \"Just one example how birthdays can be terrible,\" exclaims Sheldon. He shared his birthday with his twin sister. No one he invited would come though he never liked any of them much anyway. His sister and her friends would always be mean to him like when he was six they told him that Batman was coming. He waited by the window for hours. Amy assures him that they would never hurt him like that. Sheldon made her last birthday so memorable, she wanted to return the favor. Eventually, he reluctantly accepts a party with cake, presents and demonstrations of admiration and love; however, Amy owes him \"big time\".The guys are at the comic shop and Howard asks Raj what he's getting Sheldon for his birthday. Leonard then thinks of the idea to invite a real Batman to his party due to Sheldon's bad childhood experience. He then asks Stuart for Adam West's contact info since Stuart tried to get him for a comic book signing for his store. Stuart gives it to them, but warns them that he is something of a diva.Meanwhile at 4A, the ladies are asking Sheldon what he wants at his party. He would like a three layered chocolate cake with strawberry frosting. No messages on the cake in capital letters since he doesn't like his cake yelling at him. Mylar (foil) balloons, not latex. And if Amy brings water balloons, he'll jump off the roof and aim for her car. As for music, he likes marching bands and Tibetan throat singing. Penny nixes the music.Leonard, Raj and Howard in Leonard's car going to pick up Adam West and they start getting into a debate over who is the best Batman. For Raj is Michael Keaton, Christian Bale, Lego Batman and then Adam West.At the apartment. Penny, Stuart and Bernadette are there decorating.

Stuart is hurt that Bernie never told him she was pregnant.Adam West is now in the car. also discussing the best Batman actors. Adam West states that Christian Bale is overrated. Raj adds that he thought Michael Keaton brought a sense of humor to the role. Adam scoffs saying that if you're factoring in humor, HE should be number one. West, Keaton, Kilmer, Lego, Bale and that pretty boy Clooney. Howard thinks that Bale should be higher since he personified the term \"I'm Batman. Adam West had his own muscles and none were built into his costume, unlike everyone else. He also is not aware of Ben Affleck being the next Batman.At Penny's apartment, Sheldon and Amy are getting ready. Amy is helping Sheldon with his tie waiting for Penny to call them.In 4A, everyone is there. Leonard and Penny are talking to his mother. He wonders why she came so far and it was because he came to her sixtieth. Leonard hadn't been invited or notified about this before. Penny adds that to be fair, they did get married in Las Vegas and didn't invite her.Back in Apartment 4B, Amy got a text from Penny saying that it was okay for them to come over and as they're walking, Once they open the door, everyone jumps and yells \"Happy Birthday\" and asks him to make a public speech. Sheldon thanks everyone for coming. Beverly, Wil Wheaton, Adam West says, \"Happy Birthday, Sherman.\" He starts to hear his own heartbeat loudly and then retreats to the bathroom to hide.Once he runs off, Leonard suggests that he talk to him. Penny rushes off to confront Sheldon. The whole party of people and presents was just too much for him. Sheldon is one of her favorite people and if he wants to spend his party in the bathroom, she is staying there with him. Sheldon thinks that people will think that he is weird. Penny retorts that he is weird, everyone knows he is weird, yet they still came to the party to honor him because they love him so much. Kripke then knocks on the door because he needs to check his hair since he might have a shot with Beverly.Leslie (Sara Gilbert) approaches Leonard and mentions that it has been quite a while and that so much has changed. He adds that Penny and him got married. She offers her congratulations.Penny comes out announcing Sheldon's return. Sheldon apologizes for his behavior and tells everyone to enjoy themselves. Amy then proposes a toast to him. She says that it is customary for the birthday boy to receive the presents, but she feels that she got the greatest gift the day he was born. Howard then says that he has known him for a long time and it is a pleasure to work with him and to say that he is his friend. Wil Wheaton says that despite their ups and downs, his life is so more interesting because he is in it. Sheldon may be a fan of Star Trek, but Wil is a fan of Sheldon Cooper. Beverly says that the future holds great things for him and they all can't wait to see what they are. Raj is quoting Gandhi and Sheldon just wants him to speed it up. Leslie Winkle mentions that in the past she would have said something obnoxious like \"Happy Birthday, Dumbass,\" they have both grown and it is just nice to see everyone again. Sheldon adds that he doesn't like change so Leslie shouts, \"Happy Birthday, Dumbass!\"Bernadette has nothing to add that hasn't already been said, \"So here's to you, Sheldon.\" Leonard says that he can't remember a time when he wasn't in his life though he tries. He makes him laugh, makes him a better scientist and makes him crazy. He's not his friend, he's his brother. Stuart tries to speak, but Amy interrupts him with a Skype call. Stephen Hawking slowly wishes him a Happy Birthday until they realize he is singing the song. Leonard asks him to pause while they light the cake candles and all do it. Penny makes Sheldon hug her.

Even though it is oatmeal day, Leonard made him French Toast sticks and oatmeal. Sheldon walks cheerily and greets Dr. and Mrs. Hofstadter. He announces that he is going to start looking for another woman.Sheldon invited Howard and Raj over since they had originally found Amy for him; it is only logical for them to help him find a new female companion. He is looking for a woman who is educated, intelligent who shares his interests while retaining her own unique point of view. She has to be kind, patient and can't imagine her life without him by 10:00 PM.Amy is trying on a new dress in 4B. She is a little shy to show her new dress to Penny and Bernadette because she is really stepping out of her comfort zone. Finally coming out in a very modest dress.They continue to press Amy for details about her upcoming date. The guy is British, named David Gibbs (Stephen Merchant) and they are going that night to an Italian restaurant. Bernadette convinces Penny to go spy on Amy to find out more about her date. She doesn't think that she is sneaky; because she is so short it's adorable.Working on Sheldon's new girl, Howard wants to put him on every dating site available. Sheldon is worried that his page might be answered by a computer simulating a human being, but Raj wonders if that would bother him. As an alternative, Sheldon wants the women to battle for him in a battle of wits and for the winner to come through the door, sit down next to him and quietly watch Daredevil with him. To present Sheldon as a prize, they decide to set him up on Craigslist as an intelligent Caltech professor seeking a girlfriend and that she has to solve a series of puzzles to get his contact information. Raj and Howard are actually jealous of those candidates who get to solve the puzzles and they already have seen the prize.Leonard and Penny are walking down the stairs. Leonard thinks that they are going to see a documentary on soda can recycling, but Penny insists that they are going to meet up with Bernadette for their surveillance of Amy and her date. Leonard wants to see what the Big Soda companies don't want you to know, while Penny wants to find out who Amy is with.Sheldon puts the Sheldon Cooper Girlfriend Challenge online. The questions require knowledge of science, fantasy, and flag facts. If she solves them, then she is intelligent, tenuous, and socially awkward and has nothing better to do on a Saturday night. That sounds too good to be true to Sheldon.At the restaurant, Amy and Dave start talking about their previous relationships. Dave was married and left England after his divorce. He wanted children and she wanted a French pastry chef. Amy says that she had only one relationship that after five years was becoming more work than it should be. She describes him as a Caltech theoretical physicist and calls him Sheldon. Dave asks if she means Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Dave would love Sheldon's job and had been following his work for years. The date then starts going downhill as Dave spends the rest of the night asking questions about Sheldon.Bernadette, Penny, and Leonard are spying on the date from Bernadette's car across the street. Bernadette isn't a stalker, she is just a girl with military level spy equipment who kept tabs on her boyfriends. Penny also thinks that he likes her, but he is just asking her about Sheldon. Bernadette returns with the videos she took. Leonard just wants to leave and go see the movie. Bernadette wonders why she even brought him.The dinner date continues with more questions about Sheldon. He asks how long it took him to write a certain research paper. The answer was an hour and a half, one of her dates which is much like this one. Dave also wants to be introduced to him. He thinks that it would be weird to meet her ex-boyfriend.Back in the car, Leonard needs a bathroom break and Bernadette hands him a bottle.The other guys are counting down to 10:00 PM. No one arrives at the apartment. Howard remarks that it was a fun experiment, while Sheldon is convinced that someone will show up. Raj wonders if he really wants someone who is exactly like him. Opposites do attract. Sheldon comments that if that is true, he should spend his time with them.When their dinner is over, Amy tells him that it's late and they should go. Dave apologizes that he has been stupid talking all night about her ex-boyfriend. he doesn't want her to forget to introduce him.The girls notice that the couple under surveillance is coming toward them.

Amy wants to know what they are doing there and Bernadette turns the tables asking her the same thing. Leonard returns and Dave is excited to meet Dr. Leonard Hofstadter, though Leonard is reluctant to shake his hand considering where he came from.At a minute to go, the guys count down the last sixty seconds. Sheldon is worried that it might be Jennifer Lawrence since he didn't like \"The Hunger Games\". Their watch ticks down and no one shows up. Raj consoles with that when it is supposed to happen, it will happen. A moment later there is a knock at the door and it is a beautiful girl named Vanessa Bennet (Lio Tipton). She is late because she was at a boring symposium on atomic spectroscopy and the puzzles saved her life. She knows Klingon, Sanskrit and facts about flags. They speak to each other in both languages and are smiling at each other.She just had to meet him. Sheldon calls her a special lady, but since she didn't complete the challenge on time Sheldon shuts the door in her face much to the shock and disbelief of Raj and Howard. Sheldon explains that not only was she late, but she found atomic spectroscopy boring.Finally, Amy is in her car with Dave at the end of her date and she ends things with him.

Leonard brings him a meal which angers Sheldon because it was chicken and star soup instead of chicken noodle.Skyping with Amy who is still at the NeuroBiology conference, Sheldon complains that everyone is mad at him for no reason. Sheldon explains that when one is sick, they can be cranky and say things where other people's feelings don't matter. Knowing that her gentle and loving explanation will be tricky, she tells Sheldon that he can be unbearable when he is sick and that is why his friends skip out to the movies...or spend an extra few days at a NeuroBiology conference.The guys visit the comic book store to take a break from Sheldon. He had been there to buy a comic book and told Stuart that death was now at his door. Wanting to do more things without him, they noted that Amy's break from Sheldon improved their relationship. Raj is in as long as it doesn't end up with having sex with Sheldon. Leonard and Penny were thinking of a weekend in Las Vegas, so maybe they could all go. Raj suggests the party bus which excites Leonard and Howard. Chanting \"party bus\" does not excite them.Penny gets interested in the party bus idea as long as it's booze and music and not juice boxes and video games. Sheldon comes in and asks where they were going. Vegas did not appeal to him since it was Atlantic City without the taffy. Leonard tells him that he's not invited and that everyone else is going. He has to hang out with Stuart.Again Sheldon is doing a Skype call with Amy who asks \"What's new?\" He says that all his friends are jerks and he is mad at them. He tells her about their trip. She asks if he refused to apologize and acts like they were stupid for being mean to him. Amy realizes that he is upset, but he should just apologize to everyone and that he should do it because he feels bad. That is empathy.\nSheldon says that he has empathy. Very sarcastically he says that Leonard made him soup and he was mean to him. Amy wants him to try again. Sheldon actually does feel terrible having said it. Neat. Then Sheldon wants her to apologize for staying in Detroit. She says flatly that she feels so, so bad.Sheldon marched into the living area to tell Leonard to get ready for an apology. Leonard took care of him when he was sick and he was mean to him. He is truly sorry. Leonard accepts his statement. Sheldon then wants to be invited on the trip even though he claims that that was not the reason for the apology. Leonard explains that he upset a lot of people and that they all must agree to let him on the trip. Sheldon accepts his challenge and decides to embark on the Sheldon Cooper Apology Tour.Sheldon goes to Howard's house and apologizes. They accept it and are impressed. Then Sheldon wants to play Brenda Lee's song \"I'm sorry\" on the pan flute. And to memorialize the event he has T-shirts for them which say \"Sheldon Cooper apologized to me.\" on the front and \"and he made it better.\" on the back.Later Sheldon apologizes to Penny while she's in the shower. She accepts it. Sheldon still wants to take a picture of her with the T-shirt. Naked? She ends up screaming for Leonard to get him to leave.At the comic book store, he apologizes to Stuart who accepts it. He wasn't doing it just to get to go on the trip to Vegas. Stuart asks about what trip he was talking about.Visiting Raj he says that Raj is a good friend and he treated him badly. Raj accepts his apology. To Emily, he apologizes that he called a dermatologist not a real doctor. She must hear that all the time. Now she is insulted again and doesn't accept it. Also she gets mad at Raj for not standing up for her and walks out on him.Now having dinner, Penny asks Sheldon if they had a bad fight. Sheldon counters that it was excellent for a fight. Sheldon did go over to Emily's place to straighten things out and finally reduced her to tears. Sheldon thinks that he should apologize and everyone screams, \"No!\". Emily is not going on the trip if Sheldon is going, Sheldon tells them that the only way to show true remorse is for him to not go at all.\nNow on the party bus, Howard finds the stripper pole that he figures Raj will be on before they reach the freeway. Sheldon pops out from the bathroom surprising everyone. Penny asks why can't he give them one weekend alone. Stuart then pops out telling them all that he thought it was a bad idea. Sheldon also wanted to apologize again to Emily who looked thrilled. He tells her that he is a bit odd, but that he means well and that she is a smart and wonderful woman. And can do better than Raj. So he apologizes for his past and future gaffs. She is satisfied and says that Sheldon can go. Sheldon declines since they will have a better time without him. He leaves dragging Stuart along. Leonard and Penny really feel bad now and invite them back.Finally, Sheldon tells Emily that he was glad she and Raj could patch things up.

Of course, Leonard thinks Penny is embarrassed to introduce him to her friends.Kite fighting doesn't go well because Leonard is thinking about Penny and Howard is distracted by a cute jogger.

Leonard keeps wondering about the statistics of the game, such as a Quarterback sack. Sheldon starts describing all Leonard needs to know since his father made him watch football and was a coach. In Texas football is a second religion. Leonard invokes a Tier 1 friendship request from the roommate agreement to be taught football by Sheldon. Sheldon reluctantly agrees.Leonard readies himself for the game day even wearing an oversize Nebraska Cornhusker football jersey. Sheldon wonders if he is correct in assuming that trying to blend in with the friends will increase Leonard's chances of copulating with Penny. Sheldon is staying at home making Cylon (\"Battlestar Galactica\") toast.Howard goes to Raj's apartment to make a peace and has a new kite. (Hello Kitty kite.) Raj is still upset about being ditched all the time. Howard apologizes and offers to take Raj anyplace he wants to go. Raj decides the La Brea Tar Pits. First Howard complains about the traffic and crowds, but quickly changes his mind after Raj gives him a dirty look.At Penny's, Leonard tries to fit in with Penny's friends talking constantly about the mechanics of what they are watching. He mistakes a old clip for the real game. Penny thinks that he is drunk, but is merely embarrassing. Sheldon enters to check up on Leonard in code and offer him a kite flying alternative. Halftime comes and Leonard is disappointed that it isn't over. Penny tells him to go kite flying and he quickly agrees. Howard and Raj have made up until a woman walks by. She does smile at him and it takes a few moments before he is off again.Title reference: The football team Penny and her friends watch.", "episode_17": "The guys are returning from a garage sale (at Adam West's old house) with a heavy box of stuff they got for $60 without the dinner that Penny was expecting. They find an original script from \"Ghostbusters II\" with actual slime on it, an actual \"Alf\" doll, (which brought back such memories for Howard, since his mother got him one when he was eleven and he wished that Alf would bring his dad back from Melmac.), Mr. T's head on a Mr. Spock doll, an Indiana Jones connect the dots, an Aquaman action figure, and a \"Lord of the Rings\" ring. The sad part was then Penny didn't know that Adam West was TV's Batman.Howard checks with \"a guy\" who says the ring is the real deal used in the movie series worth $15,000 on the black market. Leonard insists on returning it to director Peter Jackson. Penny is told to hold it till they decide what to do with it. Penny is willing, but is a bit peeved that the first piece of jewelry her boyfriend gives her is a prop from a movie and she doesn't even get to keep it.That night Sheldon tries to steal it off of the sleeping Penny's neck whom he startles and slugs him. Penny tells Leonard that she just punched Sheldon when he tried to take the ring and Leonard replied, \"That's my girl.\"Raj's lawyer/cousin Venkatesh Koothrappali (Frank Maharajh) tries to negotiate with them to sell Raj's stake in the ring for a jet ski. No dice. Then they try a holding contest, last one holding onto the ring gets it. Somehow they get up the stairs and to the hallway dropping the apartment keys in the meantime. Penny walks by with a very little bag from Victoria Secret's causing Leonard to drop out and disappear into Penny's apartment. Sheldon was right about the power of sex.Later in the apartment, Howard has to explain to his mother while Raj is messing up Howard's lies. (\"I am so glad we came to this Gentile strip club! Howard, here's more bacon to tuck into the Shiksa's G-string!!\") Then they decide to talk about Sheldon's mother and grandmother. His Meemaw had to have sex to have his mother and she had sex because she LIKED it. Sheldon then starts to talk about falling water to make them want to use the bathroom. It works on Sheldon. Now all of them have to go so off to the bathroom they go. Later while asleep, he dreams that he won it, goes to the bathroom to clean and sees himself in the mirror as Gollum from LOTR.\nIn the morning, the ring can't be found. Leonard explains he found the three of them sleeping on the couch and the ring on the floor with no-one touching it, and sent it back to Peter Jackson as he had wanted to at the start. When challenged, he points out that who ever won it would be hated by the others thus ending their friendships. Case closed. Back in Leonard's room he pulls the ring out from under the bed saying. \"Hello, my precious!\"Not everyone knows the truth, because at night Leonard and Sheldon get into another fight over the ring (which Leonard had kept for himself) with Penny in the bed between them. She leaves saying that she should go back to dating dumb guys from the gym.Title reference: The guys' fight over the One Ring.", "episode_21": "When Raj tries to eat with the guys in the cafeteria, his sneezing gets him banished by the Germophobic Sheldon to another table. Sheldon has to talk to Leonard giving him the official 24-hour notice (according to the roommate agreement) that a non-related female will spend two days at their apartment. She is a human female, as no pets are allowed, other than seeing-eye dogs and cybernetic-engineered helper monkeys. She is Dr. Elizabeth Plimpton (Judy Greer), the world-famous cosmological physicist from Princeton University. Sheldon and she have been corresponding for years about gravitational wave signatures of Inflatons in the early universe. Leonard is a huge fan of hers. She will sleep in Sheldon's room though not sharing the room.Walking up the stairs, Sheldon questions Penny on his choice of maxi-pads in his bag, whether the wing design is just a marketing ploy. Naturally, Penny needs it explained, and Sheldon tells her about everything he bought for his lady friend: scented soaps, pantyhose, Midol, calcium chew tablets, and the yogurt that is good for regulating the female bowels. Sheldon requests that Penny not waste her time with a lot of female banter, such as hair styles, shoe styles, mudpacks, or Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.Dr. Plimpton shows up at the door. Sheldon insists Leonard play it cool, since years from now, Sheldon's biographer might ask him questions about this event. Dr. Plimpton remembered to write their building number on her left hand, because her right hand contained the coordinates of a new neutron star, and she didn't want to visit there since she would be crushed by hyper gravity. She says hello twice like Sheldon and Leonard did when they first greeted Penny. She appears to be a bit Ditzy. Sheldon greets her, and Leonard is rather nervous to meet Dr. Plimpton, shaking her hand three times and saying \"hi-lo.\" (A combination of hi and hello.) Sheldon apologizes because he is only an experimental physicist. Dr. Plimpton admits that some of her friends are experimental physicists, though not her best friends.Sheldon shows her to his bedroom and gives her the tour, rules and regulations. Gloves are available to wear if she wants to peruse his comic book collection. She also has an emergency 8-day ration kit is at the ready in case of disaster. Dr. Plimpton does ask about the relationship status of Leonard. Sheldon explains his former relationship with Penny, which was over as inexplicably as it started. They wish each other good night or good luck in case they have an apocalypse.Later, she decides to visit Leonard's room because she can't sleep. He's reading her book and is on Chapter 6. She tells him a little secret that she wrote it completely naked. A confused Leonard finds that it doesn't read that way. She shows him, recites some of it and drops her robe as she quotes from her book. The two go on to have sex.Everybody wakes up in the morning with Sheldon doing morning vocal tests and Leonard and Elizabeth coming in together. They had more than a pleasant night while giggling together. She is having coffee when Penny stops by to request a ride to work because her car is out of gas. She is introduced first to Elizabeth. Elizabeth says she was really enjoying her stay and then looks over at Leonard and giggles. Penny picks up on her body language.\nSheldon suggests that she use the bathroom because she doesn't want to follow Leonard. Leonard goes to get dressed, but Penny stops him telling him that they just broke up. She doesn't care if he wants to sleep with Sheldon's doctor buddy. Sheldon is offended that Penny would suggest it. Penny isn't suggesting it. She maintains that it already happened. Sheldon is shocked at what Leonard did, who claims that it wasn't his fault. Sheldon then feels that that implies that he accidentally tripped and fell into her lady parts. Penny is not happy about this turn of events and decides to take the bus, just in case Leonard slips on a banana peel and gets her pregnant. Sheldon is shocked by the betrayal of him and doesn't want Leonard playing with his friend.At the cafeteria, Sheldon and Elizabeth stop by the table after Howard and Raj can't figure out Leonard's clues as to what he did the prior night. She wants a coffee, but not black. This time, she wants it hot, brown, and sweet while making eyes Raj.Later Howard shows up at Raj's apartment for Halo Night and finds Elizabeth at his apartment. Elizabeth wants Howard to stay for some role playing games though not the Dungeons and Dragons type. She runs into the bedroom to get ready. Howard is shocked and tells Raj that he broke up with Bernadette weeks ago. Leonard shows up and Elizabeth is excited about that. He wants to know what is going on and Howard welcomes them to the Penthouse Forum. Elizabeth is down to her bra and Raj shoos everybody out to make a dramatic entrance. Then he locks Howard and Leonard out and has her to himself.Later, walking up the The stairs, Penny asks about Dr. S**t Bunny. She doesn't think he needs to know, but Leonard has to explain why he did it. She let him.Title reference: Dr. Elizabeth Plimpton visits and \"stimulates\" Leonard and Raj.", "episode_8": "Leonard, Howard, and Raj are camping out in the desert to observe the Leonid Meteor Shower. Raj is just entering map coordinates into the computer, and with Howard's help they now have free HBO. They are trying to choose between \"Real Sex\" and \"Dune\". \"Real Sex\" wins.\nMeanwhile, back in apartment 4A, Sheldon is writing in his log that he is completing his paper on Decays of Highly-Excited Massive String States and misses the warmth of human companionship...the second statement being untrue. BAZINGA!As Sheldon is on his own, he tries to order 1/4 of the appetizer plate and one half of the Golden Treasure for Two, which really is meant for two people; however, the Thai restaurant isn't cooperating. Sheldon hears Penny screaming for help from her apartment, warns the Thai restaurant that his sharply worded comments on Yelp took down a local muffin store, and then runs off to assist Penny.\nSheldon as usual knocks on her apartment door and Penny yells at him to come in. He finds her bedroom door closed, and knocks again. Penny yells that she is in the bathroom so Sheldon asks if he should come back at a better time. Penny replies that he has to get in there and then tells him not to dare knock on the bathroom door. Sheldon finds her lying in the bathtub naked and wrapped in her shower curtain. Penny has slipped in the shower and dislocated her shoulder. Sheldon commented that she did not have a shower mat or any adhesive duck stickers (like Sheldon has) on the floor of the tub to prevent slipping. The ducks are whimsical because they even have umbrellas though they have neither the need for, nor the ability to use, umbrellas. Penny tells him that she has to go to the emergency room and that Sheldon will have to drive her since she can't. Sheldon eventually declares, \"Never let it be said that Sheldon Lee Cooper ignored the pleas of a \"damsel in distress\". His final observation is: \"It seems ironic that for a lack of 99-cent adhesive ducks, we might die in fiery car crash\".In the desert, Howard is searching for women for him and Raj. Nearby are several groups of nerds and couple of 50-something middle school teachers \"reeking of desperation.\" The ladies give Howard a batch of cookies to share with the guys. They were camping in a VW Microbus and were wearing tie-dye Grateful Dead t-shirts too. The guys don't know it, but the ladies have been really hiding illegal narcotics in the cookies, which the guys proceed to eat.Penny has made it to her bedroom and tells Sheldon that she needs clothes. Sheldon sees no organizational system in her underwear drawer. He asks her which panties she wears on Mondays. Penny tells her that she just needs shorts and a top. Sheldon has to show her four combinations before she finds something that looks cute together. She then tells Sheldon to close his eyes since she doesn't want him to see her naked. Sheldon starts to help, giving her an account of those in heroic mythology who were not allowed to look either. He gets the top over her head and then Penny tells him that he has to get her hurt arm into the sleeve. Reaching around, Sheldon grabs Penny's breast to which she asks him if that was her arm. Sheldon replies that it doesn't feel like an arm. Penny says rather sarcastically that maybe he should let it go. He does so.Under the stars, the guys are under the effect of the drug-stashed cookies. They feel really good watching the star twinkle. Raj tells them that the meteors will appear after the earth moves into their path. Leonard claims that he can feel the earth moving, and that it is moving too fast. Raj \"slows\" it down for him. Leonard again says how pretty the stars are, and Raj thinks that everything his friends say sounds funny with their American accents.Penny has trouble getting Sheldon to even start the car. He has had several hours of practice in a driving simulator, but it didn't work out well for him. To Penny's irritation, he spends a very long time adjusting the driver's seat and the side mirrors, one of which was broken when Penny was in a minor accident.Back in the desert, Raj is dreaming about being able to communicate with rabbits and then rule them. Leonard is angry that his name has \"nerd\" in it and wants to be known as Angelo because it has both \"Angel\" and Jello\" in it. Howard reveals that he lost his virginity to his cousin, Jeanie: it all started when he attended the funeral of his Uncle Murray and went to Aunt Barbara's house for some pickled herring, reflecting that they \"never meant for it to happen\"; nowadays, he can't look at pickled herring without getting horny and guilty all over again.Sheldon is driving Penny to the hospital very slowly, diligently over-obeying all the traffic regulations. Penny is complaining about his slow speed, while Sheldon is complaining about the knocking engine and the lit check engine light. \"Warp speed ahead, Mr. Spock,\" orders Penny. Sheldon insists that Mr. Spock is the Science Officer and does not pilot the USS Enterprise, though he would pull it over if the check engine light were on.\nAt a stop light, Sheldon wonders why Penny has the Chinese character for \"soup\" on her right buttock. She says that the word is \"courage\". He knows about the tattoo since, like a true hero, he did actually peek.Back at camp, everyone is famished as Howard goes through all the pudding cups, and Raj uses the Slim Jims to eat his. All that is left are blue ice packs, which look like big yummy Otter Pops! Then they go back to search for more pudding cups.At the hospital emergency room, Sheldon fills out Penny's medical form. She says no to diabetes and kidney disease, though she is quickly getting a migraine. She's not pregnant (\"Are you sure? You look a bit puffy\"), she has no skin lesions except for the soup tattoo, and her menstrual period is \"in progress\". Penny then tells Sheldon that she is scared and in a lot of pain. She wants Sheldon to be more comforting. Sheldon then apologizes, contorting quite a bit before patting her and saying, \"There, there. Sheldon is here.\"The guys have run out of food and plan to raid the other campsites. Howard saves the day. His mother has sent an \"I love you\" care package consisting of a brisket, which they tear into without forks or knives. The potatoes and carrots that accompany it are so good that they forget why they are there. The meteor shower is visible in the background, but the starving geeks are oblivious to it.Sheldon gets Penny home, although she could have floated home from all of the pain medication she was on. Sheldon gets ready to leave; however, Penny wants him to take her to her bed. Penny then drones on that everyone thinks that he is just this annoying robot man, but underneath it all, just like the character in the Wall-E movie, he is full of love and can save the plants and get the fat people out of their floating chairs.\nThen she wants him to sing \"Soft Kitty\" to her. He protests, saying the song is only for singing when one is sick. But Penny replies that injured and drugged are a kind of sick. After Sheldon starts singing, Penny interrupts him and gets him to sing it in a round. Sheldon resisted at first, but Penny informs him that she has all night. He then reluctantly started singing \"Soft Kitty\" in a round. Penny is very happy after they finish the song.Around the campfire, Howard is being teased by Leonard and Raj about sleeping with his cousin who turned out to be his second cousin.Title reference: Sheldon telling Penny that he has sticky non-slip duck shaped appliques in his bath tub and that they would have prevented Penny's accident.", "episode_2": "Sheldon, Howard and Raj in the comic book store, with Howard arguing to Sheldon that Wolverine (Marvel Comics) was not born with bone claws. Leonard arrives and the others are surprised he is not with Penny. As Wolowitz and Koothrappali pry a little more, they discover Leonard is not as happy with the sex as he thought he would be, characterizing it as \"just fine\". Sheldon settles his argument with Howard by quoting the specific issue (Wolverine: Origin) and page number 22 that contain the information on Wolverine's claws.At the apartment, Sheldon is disappointed to discover the Indian food has been purchased from somewhere different than usual. When Leonard again uses the phrase 'just fine', Howard begins to mock him without alerting Penny. Sheldon is oblivious and quickly goes into the discussion they had earlier. This revelation causes Penny to leave in embarrassment. When Leonard gets angry as she leaves, Sheldon thinks he has crossed a line, and tries to figure out what it is.Leonard and Penny then have an argument in her apartment. Leonard defends his comment of 'fine' by saying, \"You put it in front of wine or dining and you've really got something!\" Penny says it was \"Okay\", and says, \"You put in front of Dokey and you've really got something!\" They decide they should have had some wine first and attempt again.Back in apartment 4A, Howard and Raj are discussing Shiksa goddesses, which Raj finishes by pointing out Leonard has one and Howard doesn't. Following this fact Sheldon finally determines the line he crossed. Hearing a cricket, Sheldon claims he knows the species from its chirping speed and the temperature. Howard, still angry from losing the previous disagreement on Wolverine's bone claws, says Sheldon is wrong. After, Howard proposes a bet which is rebuffed, he calls Sheldon a chicken, resulting in him going into a childhood experience when he was chased by a chicken. Eventually they bet Howard's rare Fantastic Four, against Sheldon's rare The Flash. Raj casually states they must find the cricket to determine its species and is greeted by shock.After making out and a long pause, Leonard says, \"More wine?\" responded to by, \"Hit me.\"Back to the bet, we see them search the closet, and then continue into the hallway. Sheldon convinces Howard to check the elevator shaft\nWe again quickly see Penny and Leonard in Penny's apartment, now very drunk, repeating the word \"schnapps\" because it is \"fun to say.\"\nSheldon has now climbed into the elevator shaft, and as the others check the stairwell his flashlight's batteries run out. He closes with, \"It's really dark down here.\"\nLeonard is now throwing up, and Penny comes in and after a small conversation she does too.The next day, Raj and Sheldon are arguing about the finally-found cricket's name. Howard and Raj think it should be Toby, while Sheldon argues it should be an appropriate cricket name, like Jiminy Cricket or Jiminy. After Howard enters with an insect guide, they still argue its species. They ask Raj, but he no longer cares. After Leonard enters and claims he had a horrible night, they just continue bickering, paying almost no notice to Leonard, and settle to allow Professor Crawley (Lewis Black), a noted entomologist, to identify it.The three then enter Professor Crawley's lab, and discover Rajesh has a fear of bugs. Sheldon jokes that since he is also afraid of women, ladybugs must render him catatonic. When Professor Crawley enters, it is revealed he is a 60-ish, irritable man who has become furious now that the funding to his lab has been cut. Throughout their conversation, Professor Crawley claims he can identify every insect and arachnid on the planet (among discussing his divorce and agreeing with Sheldon that Toby is a stupid cricket name) and settles the bet by saying Toby is a common field cricket.In the lobby of the apartment building, Sheldon informs Penny of the bet. When Penny says she is upset about her relationship, Sheldon tells Penny that she can always return to being friends with Leonard.Leonard goes over to Penny's and asks what Sheldon told her. After a brief discussion, they decide to follow Sheldon's advice and return to being friends. After a hug, they both spring into a long kiss and as Leonard closes the door he finishes with, \"Okay Dokey\".", "episode_15": "It's nearly Valentine's Day, and Howard is excited to announce his plans since he has a girlfriend. Sheldon wonders why Howard would celebrates a 3rd-century saint who was stoned and beheaded. That still beats Raj who is spending his night with a rotisserie chicken. Leonard has been invited to Switzerland to observe the Large Hadron Collider at the CERN Laboratory and is taking Penny as his \"Plus One\". Sheldon is beyond ecstatic, so much so that he didn't bother questioning why Leonard would get such an honor. Sheldon is assuming that Leonard will take him since Penny has no interest in subatomic particle research while Leonard has been dreaming of spending Valentine's Day with a girl since he was 6.Leonard has assembled for Penny clues on where they're going, but apparently the Swiss Cheese cut by the Swiss Army Knife and the fondue set aren't enough. She is not excited about the CERN Lab Super Collider in Switzerland, but she is excited about going to ski in Switzerland. And then Sheldon whips out their Roommate agreement. There is a clause stating one roommate must take the other if one of them gets invited to the CERN Supercollider. It doesn't contain any clauses about girlfriends because that seemed too far-fetched when the contract was signed.Sheldon says that he has always lived up to his part of the roommate agreement including asking how Leonard is doing at least once a day, not staging mock biohazard drills after 10 P.M. and not practicing Tuvan throat singing which he demonstrates. To Sheldon, Leonard is a bigger traitor than Judas, who did hang himself, Darth Vader, Benedict Arnold, and Rupert Murdoch, who owns Fox network, the network that canceled \"Firefly.\"In the morning, Sheldon makes Frodo-shaped pancakes and serves Leonard in bed and suggesting they watch \"Babylon 5\" with director's commentary, even though he hates it. Leonard doesn't change his mind so Sheldon takes the pancakes away.Sheldon then approaches Penny. In the laundry room, Penny is shown a PowerPoint presentation for her about why he is the more appropriate choice to go. He has images of himself and Penny, and of the Super Collider and Bath & Body Works. She has to match the person to where they should be. Penny tells him that it's Leonard's decision and he chose her. Sheldon walks away telling her that it's his dream to go and then she says she'll talk to Leonard. Sheldon thanks her, and even hugs her while asking her when to stop.Leonard is angry that he went to Penny behind his back and says Sheldon isn't going, even admitting if Penny didn't exist, he'd go alone rather than take him. Thus ends the \"friendship clause\" in their roommate agreement and Sheldon will never take Leonard as his guest when Bill Gates invites him to go swimming.\nThe morning they are leaving, Penny catches the flu. Now Sheldon can go, and he'll pack as soon as he's done vomiting.Sheldon is perplexed on how he got the flu...until he remembered he hugged Penny. She made him sick and they end up taking care of each other spending Valentine's Day together.\nIn Switzerland, Leonard and Raj get a beautiful room.

Penny invites Sheldon to dance with her; however, Sheldon assures her that in no other alternate universe was he dancing. It's also oatmeal day and Sheldon wants oatmeal. Leonard enters and apologizes for not giving Penny his schedule. Sheldon wants to know why they aren't having their \"conjugal visits\" in her apartment conjugal visits as previously stipulated. Unfortunately, they broke the bed in Penny's apartment. That confuses Sheldon that the bed of sturdy construction should be able to handle a Homunculus. A perfectly formed miniature human being. Leonard gets peeved when Penny calls him her little Homunculus. They pick up their French toast and head back to Leonard's room. Sheldon looks at his plate and says that it does smell good, but since its oatmeal day he dumps it in the trashcan.As Sheldon, Leonard and Penny sit around the coffee table, Sheldon tries to get into Penny's banter about the coincidences of first names of the employees at work. Penny clears the table and Sheldon offers her a chocolate drop. Leonard wonders why Sheldon is being nice. Howard and Raj enter dressed to go to a Goth club including fake arm sleeve tattoos. Sheldon would love to go with him. (Bazinga!) Penny is more than happy to turn them down on both of their behalf. Raj whispers to Howard. \"Yes, she's pushy and he's whipped, but that's not the expression.\" They head out to get more eyeliner at Walgreens. Leonard predicts that they will get beat-up at that bar. Penny predicts that they are going to get beaten-up at Walgreens. Penny apologizes for almost sitting in Sheldon's spot so he offers her another chocolate.Howard and Raj are trying to blend in, drinking vodka and cranberry juice since it looks like blood. Raj has a light beer which is also what the Goth Chicks next to them are drinking, Bethany (Molly Morgan) and Sarah (Sarah Buehler) (\"Not That Anybody Cares!\"), whom they strike up a conversation with.Back at the apartment, they are watching anime as Penny tells the story of her friend Anna Mae Fletcher. She realizes she is talking too much and gets another chocolate from Sheldon. Then she takes a phone call out in the hallway with Sheldon rewarding her gain. Leonard has had enough. He knows that Sheldon is using chocolate as a positive reinforcement for what you consider correct behavior. Leonard tells him to stop training his girlfriend like a lab rat. Sheldon squirts him and tells him \"Bad Leonard.\"Howard and Raj tried to describe everything they talk about in Goth or dark terms. Raj works with dark matter and they like Goth food. Sarah wonders what Goth food is. The girls get them to go to a tattoo parlor to get a tattoo.While Penny is still on the phone, Sheldon tells Leonard that with the right stimulus he can get rid of Penny's annoying habits and turn her into a better girlfriend including that high-pitched laugh. When Sheldon lowers his voice, Penny naturally lowers hers.Howard is looking though the tattoo catalog and can't decide between the skull or Kermit the Frog. Bethany tells him that if he gets the skull, she'll put a smile on its face (Presumably she meant that they would have sex). Howard picks it, but then freaks out at just the alcohol swab. They admit their deceptions and the girls leave.Sheldon asks that they keep their \"amorous activities down to a decent decibel level. She agrees and gets a long-distance chocolate. First Penny asks Leonard to assemble her bed when it's so late and he declines. Then she mentions that they don't have to keep quiet and they head for her apartment. Sheldon wonders if anybody realizes sex works even better than chocolate in modifying behavior.Howard and Raj are heading home trying to make their story sound better. Also tomorrow they are going to head to a country bar to find some sexy cowgirls.Title reference: Howard and Raj go to a Goth club.", "episode_13": "Sheldon, Leonard, Raj, and Howard arrive at the Chinese restaurant where they remark that it's been a long time since only the four of them have eaten together (with Leonard dating Penny and Howard dating Bernadette). Raj becomes agitated and admits jealousy of the others as he doesn't have a girlfriend.Sheldon becomes horrified when he realizes that the restaurant has redone the menu and that General Tso's Chicken is no longer in the category of specialties, but in the category of chicken, and he becomes overly distressed when he sees a typo in the meal \"Shrimp in Mobster Sauce\", which makes him immediately come to the conclusion that the restaurant's a front for organized crime; however, the rest of the guys immediately dismiss it as a typo, and decide to leave the restaurant and get pizza at Corleone's (to which Howard sarcastically remarks \"Sure; no mobsters there.\")When Leonard and Sheldon return home they find the lock broken and the apartment ransacked, with their computers, TV, and gaming consoles gone, and everything tossed across; however, Sheldon becomes eased when he finds out that the robbers did not touch his comic books.The police soon arrive and Sheldon verbally tells the officers everything that is missing, and then gives the officers a can of energy drink that was consumed by one of the robbers, so they have the thief's fingerprints. When the police leave, Sheldon and Leonard sit on the couch, where Sheldon decides to watch TV on his iPhone until the criminals \"return to bludgeon them to death in [their] sleep\".Sheldon eventually goes to bed and barricades the door, only to have to use the bathroom seconds later. Afterwards he goes to Penny's apartment, where Leonard and Penny are preparing to go to bed. Sheldon has them go back to apartment 4A, where he tries to play charades with them, until Leonard and Penny go to bed. Seconds after they leave, Sheldon begins to watch a slasher movie on his iPhone, and runs to Leonard and Penny after one of the characters dies a gory death.The next day, Sheldon has Raj and Howard install a complex security system in the apartment (with motion detectors, infrared sensors, and facial recognition software). When Penny enters the apartment a second later, a net falls on her. As Sheldon begins to remark about the flaws with the net, Howard tells him that he will get it electrified.That night, Sheldon is updating his daily log when he hears something bump. Instead of going out his door to investigate, he chooses to crawl around the ledge outside of his window to Leonard's room, where he and Penny are starting to have sex. When Sheldon comes in through the window, they tell him that the bump was them knocking over a lamp by accident. Now calm, Sheldon goes to make some warm milk and check the perimeter, but accidentally sets off the security system, with the now-electrified net falling on him, making him wet his pajamas.A few days later, Sheldon and Leonard have bought a new TV, laptops, and gaming consoles. Sheldon then reveals that he is moving away from Pasadena forever because of the recent events. After ruling out various cities (like Enid, Oklahoma and Boone, North Carolina) as well as the entire state of Nebraska (since Penny's from there), he eventually decides to move to Bozeman, Montana. Despite protests from Howard and Penny to get over his problems, Sheldon still decides to leave. He plays one last video, revealing that Leonard, Penny, Raj, and Howard were \"three of [his] closest friends and one treasured acquaintance\". Raj and Howard begin arguing over who's the friend and acquaintance.At the bus station, when Sheldon arrives in Bozeman, he is horrified over the cold temperature, and is quickly robbed of his bags by a local thief. Sheldon eventually gets his bags back, and decides to return to Pasadena.

After being asked to contribute, Sheldon gives them a bust of Sir Issac Newton to hang on the tree partially since he was born on Christmas Day and Jesus was not (Jesus was born in the summer and his birthday was later moved to 25th December to coincide with an existing pagan holiday)A visit from Leonard's mother, Dr. Beverly Hofstadter (Christine Baranski), delights Sheldon and horrifies Leonard. Penny is upset because Leonard didn't mention his mother's visit to her, but that is nothing compared to when Leonard learns that Sheldon knows more about his own mother than Leonard does: Leonard learns about his parents' pending divorce, his mother's carpal tunnel surgery, and his dog Mitzy's death all after Sheldon has known directly from Beverly (as they have been in regular touch). Penny is upset that Leonard hasn't told his mother that he is dating her. Sheldon interjects that it might be since all of Beverly's kids are over achievers and maybe Leonard is afraid that Beverly would not be proud of his choice of Penny as a mate.Beverly questions Howard and Raj about their \"ersatz homosexual relationship\" (alluding to her last visit in \"The Maternal Capacitance\") and Howard tries to tell Leonard's mother that he has a girlfriend, but she doesn't seem to believe him (Bernadette was away to meet her grandmother). He asks Leonard to tell his mother, but Leonard responds, \"I have no idea what you're talking about\", but Leonard tells her Howard has a girlfriend after Howard makes him since Leonard knows and Howard scoffed at Leonard not knowing what's Howard's talking about.Penny offers to drive Beverly to her hotel and they talk talking. Penny and Beverly go out drinking at the Cheesecake Factory bar and get terribly drunk. Penny tells her about her relationship with Leonard and Beverly tells her about her interest in the busboy (She wanted to know about Leonard's penis, but when Penny balks, Beverly accepts to hear her opinion on the busboy's penis).When they get back to the apartment, a drunk Beverly scolds Leonard for not telling her that he is in a relationship with Penny (whom she calls her home-girl).

Sheldon mentions several complaints Leonard has about her, which he was too much of a gentleman to confront her about: her driving, the bed full of stuffed animals that stare at him during their \"amorous activities,\" her tardiness, or her singing. Her message to Leonard is that he can drop dead! Sheldon then comments, Sotto Voce, about how Penny's attitude toward her job, and her obliviousness to same, keeps her from getting bigger tips.Sheldon quickly goes home and suggests to Leonard to apologize to Penny before she gets back. Penny comes storming in at full boil to yell at Leonard over the list that Sheldon detailed to her.

Leonard gladly returns the affection while Penny drags him into her apartment. Howard and Raj watched the greeting. Howard laments that he had not been the first to go over there. Raj sarcastically observed that it was first come-first served.After they get into apartment 4A, Howard and Raj confess to Sheldon that the positive results that he received in the Arctic was really static from an electric can opener they kept turning on and off. Furious, especially at Leonard who thought up the idea, Sheldon confronts him at Penny's apartment, much to Leonard's dismay (that Sheldon is interfering with a sure chance of sex with Penny after many months). Leonard explains that he did it because Sheldon was being absolutely unbearable during the expedition when he wasn't getting the results he wanted. Plans to kill him were even brought up and discussed. One was to throw his kindle out and then lock the door behind him as he went out to fetch it. The other was to simply shoot him with Howard's crossbow.To make matters worse, Sheldon already contacted everyone at the university that he had positive results. Crushed that his best friend has destroyed his dreams and humiliated him, Sheldon retreats to his bedroom. Penny goes to comfort him; however, she makes Sheldon realize he also missed both Comic Con and the new Star Trek movie.The next day, Sheldon still refuses to forgive Leonard, and is suffering ridicule by everyone in the physics department, especially Kripke (John Ross Bowie). As a result, he resigns and runs home to Texas.

Sheldon, as usual, is oblivious to this social convention and keeps contact with Penny, going as far as inviting himself over for spaghetti (with cut-up hot dogs reminiscent of his mother). When Sheldon reveals to the guys how he's been talking to Penny, Howard explains to him how he cannot maintain friendship with both her and Leonard.In order not to arise suspicions, Sheldon eats at his apartment, then sneaks off to the refrigerator to grab a pack of hot dogs to take over to Penny's place. Just as he's about to leave with the excuse of taking a walk; however, Howard leaves as well, insisting that the two go down together. Sheldon tries to shake off Howard, but ends up accompanying him right to his parked scooter. When he finally gets rid of his friend, Sheldon bumps into a dog which smells the hot dogs, and has to run for his life. He manages to shake the dog off and arrives at Penny's in a state of disgrace and holding a single hot dog (he says he had to trade the other hot dogs in exchange for his life). The two eat spaghetti together, and Sheldon ends up with a stomach ache from eating too much.Sheldon has trouble keeping his friendship with Penny secret from his roommate, and ends up recounting his continued friendship to Leonard in the middle of the night. Leonard, however, seems not to care about this relationship.\nSometime later, Penny and Leonard bump into each other in the laundry room, where the two try to keep things friendly between each other. Leonard explains how he's fine with Sheldon and Penny being friends, but seems upset when he learns that Penny is taking Sheldon for buying sheets, shoes and to a trip to Disneyland. Leonard complains that he just took Sheldon shoe shopping, but Penny says all she knows is that the new shoes hurt Sheldon and hence he wants them replaced. Leonard agrees to take Sheldon shoe shopping the following weekend.Leonard gives Penny suggestions on how to take care of Sheldon at Disneyland, as he is familiar with the events of Sheldon eating junk food and throwing it up after he goes on Space Mountain (and ending up with Churro vomit on shoes), and is scared of Goofy, but alright with Pluto.The remainder of this episode showcases Leonard and Penny as \"separated parents\" to their \"son\" Sheldon. Penny, it seems, has ignored Leonard's tips and Sheldon reacts exactly as Leonard had predicted. Leonard gives a \"I told you so\" look to a sheepish looking Penny\nThe two see Sheldon off to bed, and Penny admits to Leonard how they can remain friends despite their break-up. Leonard offhandedly tries to suggest they remain \"friends with benefits\". Sheldon is then having nightmares about Goofy after they leave.Title reference: Sheldon's spaghetti dinner with Penny and how it influences Penny and Leonard's friendship.", "episode_22": "Penny is about to do her toenails because she has her father's feet, when she hears Leonard and Sheldon fighting over the thermostat setting. Leonard comes over to Penny's apartment and asks if he can sleep on her couch. When Penny remarks that Leonard is nuts for living with Sheldon, he tells Penny the story of how he first met him seven years ago when Sheldon was much worse.Leonard starts out with explaining how, back in 2003, he had just started at Caltech and he needed a room for rent. The elevator was still working in the apartment building and he sees Sheldon's previous roommate, Sebastian (Steven Yeun), leaving and warning him about Sheldon being crazy. He does not heed this warning, thinking the previous roommate was the crazy one.\nAfter Leonard mistakenly knocks on his future transvestite neighbor's apartment door by mistake (who also considers Sheldon to be the crazy one), he eventually meets Sheldon. Sheldon first quizzes Leonard about his job and his science fiction character (Kirk or Picard) preferences before he allows him to enter.At this point, Sheldon's apartment is quite empty, having only two lawn chairs instead of the couch and armchair, although the lawn chair Sheldon sits on is in almost the same position as his present-day \"spot\"; the TV is balanced on cinder blocks. Sheldon gives a series of interview questions to verify whether or not Leonard is a good and worthy roommate to have and then gives him a tour, which includes showing him his future room with the message \"DIE SHELDON DIE\" painted in angry red script on a wall by the previous roommate, which Sheldon says that Leonard might want to repaint. After working out seemingly countless pages of the roommate agreement, Leonard has to promise to drive Sheldon anywhere anytime he demands, what to do if one or both succumbs to a zombie plague and the apartment's flag, Leonard moves in.Penny cannot understand how Leonard decided to stay with Sheldon, and has no sympathy for him, following which Leonard tells her about when Sheldon kicked Joyce Kim (Ally Maki), Leonard's new girlfriend, out of the apartment as Leonard had given him notice about her visit as per the roommate agreement. Penny is surprised, and she asks why he still stayed after that. Leonard tells her it turned out to be a good thing as Kim was a North Korean spy and Leonard had been working on classified rocket fuel for the government: Joyce Kim was trying to seduce Leonard for information, which, due to Sheldon, proved unsuccessful as she then defected back to North Korea. Penny now knows half of the story now: Leonard stayed with Sheldon because the latter protected him from going to prison for treason.Leonard mentions that the other part of his story has to do with the elevator's destruction, and he continues: Sheldon comes home from work and he meets Raj and Howard who work at the university too, for the first time; they and Leonard are playing a video game. Sheldon finds that Leonard has replaced Sheldon's lawn chairs with the sofa (sold to Leonard by their neighbors who moved, for $100) that is currently in the apartment. Soon, after a lot of switching spots, Sheldon finally claims his \"spot\" on the couch. After the other guys leave due to Sheldon's annoyances, they go to Howard's place. Sheldon then sits in his spot and joyously say, \"Oh, yes!\"Leonard discovers that Howard has designed a rocket, which he claims could break the sound barrier if he had the proper fuel. Leonard volunteers the fuel he'd had in the apartment (which he was going to show to Joyce Kim) and they went back to mix some. However, Sheldon notices that Leonard did not adjust the fuel for Howard's rocket size correctly. Leonard finally cracks and unloads a tirade, yelling at Sheldon for his constant arrogance. As he rants, the fuel starts smoking, prompting Leonard to panic. Leonard takes the canister outside, thinking he can confine the smoking fuel to the elevator, but Sheldon knows precisely how long he has until it explodes, so he pushes Leonard out of the elevator before stepping out himself and closing the door. Within seconds, the fuel explodes, rendering the elevator inoperable. Leonard explains his continued friendship with Sheldon by pointing out that Sheldon saved his life and didn't rat him out to the landlord, the police, or Homeland Security.While Penny gets a little annoyed at the fact that he is the reason that she has to use the stairs every day, Leonard asks her what she was doing seven years ago. While she lies to him about doing community service and studying hard, it is revealed to the audience that she was with an old boyfriend, relieved that a pregnancy test she'd taken was negative.Leonard goes back to the apartment and apologizes to Sheldon for his argument over the thermostat; however, when Leonard turns the TV on and tries to watch Babylon 5, a whole new fight starts, greatly amusing Penny.", "episode_12": "Both Leonard and Howard are getting ready for their dates.

(\"For those who split atoms or split infinitives.\" Sheldon agree when Raj bribes him with his \"Green Lantern\" lantern. Sheldon is to be Raj's wing-man. No matter what lie Raj comes up with, Sheldon has to nod and agree. Looking for females, Sheldon finds him one; the 80-year-old wife of one of the professors. The Limited Edition \"Green Lantern\" lantern does hook them Abby (Danica McKellar), who is impressed that Raj is from India. Abby saw \"Slumdog Millionaire\" and Raj claims to be a Slumdog astrophysicist. Abby invites over her friend Martha (Jen Drohan) who swoons over the \"Green Lantern\" lantern.On their double-date, Leonard won't let the issue of psychics go. Penny is upset that Leonard won't even consider it. Leonard tries to get engineer Howard and scientist Bernadette to back him up, but they won't jump into another couple's argument. Even walking up the stairs, Penny won't budge, and Leonard won't back off. She slams the door in his face opening it only to grab her leftovers from his hands. Leonard yells that he knew she was going to do that even though that didn't make him a psychic. Inside Sheldon, Raj, Abby, Martha, are playing a rock band game and Leonard asks what was going on. Sheldon replied, \"We scored. I'm the wing-man.\"The next day in Leonard's lab, Howard tells him about his night and that he got to eighth base (seventh base with his shirt off). Leonard's method for stress release is laser destroying innocent Cylon figurines with Superman next in line. Howard tells Leonard not to be so stubborn and go with his date's beliefs. Leonard doesn't want to compromise all of his intellectual beliefs. Howard demonstrates using a Venn diagram on the whiteboard the intersection between all the women he'd want to sleep with, the ones who believe what Leonard believes, and the ones willing to sleep with him. Leonard doesn't think he can do that. Howard then marks for Leonard the one person he can have sex with by placing a dot on Leonard's right hand.Raj wants to date Abby again, but Sheldon has to double-date with Martha. Sheldon would rather reformat his hard drive, disinfect the kitchen and bathroom and learn Finnish. He had fun, but doesn't want to do it again. Raj then bribes Sheldon giving him his Incredible Hulk hands signed by Stan Lee. Sheldon has always admired them and exclaims that \"Hulk\" agrees to second date with puny humans!Leonard joins Penny in the laundry to try and apologize. His apology bombs with Penny rebuffing his attempt after being the most obnoxious person on a double-date that included Howard Wolowitz. She does not agree to read a book debunking psychics, but is made happier when Leonard agrees to go see her psychic. She also warns him that she believe in ghosts, astrology, but not healing crystal. They don't work. Although Voodoo does. You don't want to mess with it!On the double-date with Sheldon and Raj, Martha and Sheldon are getting along together discussing \"Flatland\" and how it is a treatise on Victorian era social mores. Abby and Raj are making out like rabbits. Sheldon announces that it is time for him to go to bed which sounds good to Martha, thinking she'll be joining him. He tells her wearing his new Hulk hands, \"Good night, puny human\" leaving with Martha looking quite shocked.Martha is not swayed. Since Raj and Abby were getting it on in the living room, she asks Sheldon if she could hang out in his room.

Howard's mother fixes a Tur-Briska-Fil. (\"Turkey stuffed with a brisket, stuffed with Gefilte fish. It's not as good as it sounds.\")\nRaj then gets emotional and walks away. After Penny leaves, Raj returns and describes how his grant money has run out and without a job, he might be deported back to India. He has spent the last six months fooling around on the Internet. Sheldon thinks he shouldn't go back to India: he can be a stateless pirate instead. Another good thing, no women in that profession.At the university, Raj laments that he won't be able to get hamburgers or Beefaroni back at home. Howard brings some good news. Dr. Laughlin (Oliver Muirhead) wants someone to join his stellar research team. Raj has a good interview with him. Unfortunately, he must work with Dr. Millstone (Elizabeth Bogush), a very attractive woman. So he can speak to her, Raj immediately downs two glasses of sherry and then makes a sexually inappropriate comment, leaving Laughlin and Millstone speechless.Later, Howard is shocked that Raj was unable to get the job, and wants to know why. Raj, not wanting to admit the mistake he had made, claims that since he was Indian and Laughlin was British, their cultures hadn't gotten along since Ghandi. Leonard asks if Raj meant that Laughlin was discriminating Raj, because they could file a complaint. Raj lies and says that that the complaint has already been filed.Sheldon then enters and announces that he has a solution for Raj.

Penny wants to get kinky by making out in Sheldon's spot. There's a knock and Penny figures that Sheldon found out; however, it is Howard who is lonely since Raj is now working late with Sheldon. Despite obvious hints that they want to be alone, Howard sits down to watch \"Sex and the City\" (it's revealed that Penny loves this movie/series and got Leonard to watch it).Sheldon and Raj are focusing on their research at work with some disagreements. Sheldon begins by announcing that they were going to design an experiment to look for the annihilation spectra resulting from dark matter collisions in space. Raj attempts to lighten the mood with a joke about flashlights and dark matter, but Sheldon turns around and reprimands him. He explains about the seriousness of their research and the need to completely focus on their research. Raj resignedly agrees. They spend an indeterminate time staring at a mathematical formula on the whiteboard, thinking very hard (accompanied by background music of the opening guitar riff of \"Eye of the Tiger\").Leonard and Penny emerge from the bedroom to find Howard fixing them breakfast. He was there early enough to witness their final climax together, which embarrasses Penny. He and Raj usually go after hippie chicks at the farmer's market on Sundays. This time, Leonard and Penny are less subtle and Howard leaves. But not before telling them how to finish their breakfast as he decides to spend time with his mom. Penny feels guilty, so Leonard invites him back easily, since Howard was waiting right outside the door.At the university, Sheldon and Raj were arguing their work and Sheldon won't let him erase his figures. Raj has had enough and leaves. Sheldon goes to Raj's apartment to tell him that he was correct, though Sheldon won't admit that he was wrong.

Both Leonard and Penny slip on the marbles falling on their butts. Bernadette realizes that Sheldon is overtired, and makes him go to bed by verbally intimidating him, and reminding him that a lack of REM sleep leads to impaired cognitive function.In the middle of the night, Leonard and Penny are awakened to a phone call from a security guard at a local shopping mall. When Leonard arrives at the mall, he finds Sheldon in a ball pit building carbon atoms out of plastic balls. When Leonard tells Sheldon that they have to go home, Sheldon immediately hides under the balls, leading to Leonard chasing him through the ball pit with difficulty. Sheldon keeps popping up and shouting \"Bazinga!\", which only further frustrates and angers Leonard.A few hours afterwards, Leonard and Penny are asleep again, but Sheldon wakes them up and tells them that his solution to his math problem is working in a menial job, much like how Albert Einstein did when he was working at the Patent Office in Switzerland and discovered special relativity.The next day, Sheldon goes to a job center and tries to apply for several menial jobs, but quickly angers the clerk he talks to. Sheldon is eventually removed from the center by security, and decides to work as a busboy without pay with Penny and Bernadette at the Cheesecake Factory. Sheldon quickly realizes that being a waiter is more menial than being a busboy, and quickly trades positions, excelling at waiting. Although he is never hired, the restaurant appears happy to let him continue with his work (presumably as he is not asking for pay). Later on, after taking Leonard, Howard and Raj's orders, Sheldon accidentally drops a pile of plates, but realizes that he's been looking at his problem all wrong and that the electrons move through the Graphene in waves, and rushes off to solve his problem, leaving Penny to take care of his mess.Eventually, Raj pressures Howard to go disco roller-skating with him, much to Raj's joy and Howard's annoyance.Title reference: Sheldon's attempt at solving his problem by working in a menial job, comparing it to Albert Einstein's discoveries made while working in Switzerland in the Patent Office.", "episode_18": "Raj is going on about the ponytails found on the aliens in the James Cameron film, Avatar.

Sheldon has spoken in front of small groups before, but any group large enough to trample Sheldon to death scares him. 36 adults or 70 kids is his limit. Penny was once very scared; however, the world looks a lot different on a haystack in the back of a Ford F-150 as a part of the Corn Queen's Court. Leonard thinks Sheldon is being ridiculous, Sheldon tells them that as the valedictorian of his college at 14, his heart started pounding in his chest, his vision became blurry, and he fainted.Later, the gang decides to team up and help Sheldon. They'll be his X-Men to Sheldon's Professor Xavier. Penny will help him a nice new suit to give him confidence.

Sheldon wonders how a new suit will prevent him from passing out. He thinks he looks like a clown in that nice suit.Next up is Leonard, who has the notepad out and is asking questions. He at least tries to interpret Sheldon's dreams, discusses the standard inkblot test and the Adler Inferiority Complex. Leonard thinks Sheldon might subconsciously think he doesn't deserve the award. When he was young he had to give back a ribbon he won for an experiment seeing if Lima beans grew better with classical music. His mother pointed out his younger brother did a Lima beans growing worse with rock 'n' roll music experiment already. The session dissolves into Sheldon discussing how Leonard is still angry at his mother reducing Leonard to tears. Sheldon feels cured because if someone like Leonard can crawl out of bed every morning, he ought to be able to face a room full of people.At the banquet, Leonard gets to introduce Sheldon, but first reads a letter that his mother sent him. Sheldon is getting nervous so Penny hands him her glass of wine. Sheldon claims that the alcohol Penny gave her is defective. She then proceeds to give her Howard's glass of wine.

He breaks into \"The Elements\" by Tom Lehrer.In the morning, while suffering a hangover, Sheldon comes out of his room, without his trousers, as Penny and Leonard have their morning coffee. His answer to where his pants went is already on YouTube under \"Physicist Melts Down.\" He starts talking about higher dimensions where he could take off his pants over his head. And just when Sheldon thinks it can't be any more humiliating, he continues: \"And now for the astronomers in the audience, get ready to see the dark side of the moon.

Howard and Raj figure out that something is wrong between him and Penny and asks about various kinky scenarios including pouring maple syrup all over him or asking them to start waxing. The subject changes to bowling where Penny is on their team due to her skills.The guys are playing against Stuart's team which includes as a substitute evil Wil Wheaton. Wil was ready to parry with Sheldon, but had no answer to Howard's question about him hitting on Whoopi Goldberg. Sheldon is a pretty good bowler since he was on the East Texas Christian Youth Group Holy Rollers team. Leonard or Penny are still talking about her inability to say \"I love you,\" from the prior night.

She has said \"I love you\" too soon in a relationship and got burned. Leonard also says that he has been in this relationship two-years longer than her. They are cool about each other and ready to go bowling.For the new match, Sheldon presents everyone with their shirts and new team name: The Wesley Crushers. Not a celebration of the character as everyone thinks, but they are the crushers of Wesley. As usual, Sheldon misses that everyone else doesn't see things the same way he naively does.\nWil throws Sheldon off causing him to make a gutter ball. He tells Sheldon to embrace the dark side, which Sheldon points out is not his franchise, it's from Star Wars. Both teams are playing well. Sheldon scores and yells as his mother would say, \"THANK YOU, JESUS!\"\nWil Wheaton sees what is going on between Leonard and Penny and tells her about a bad relationship that went on for two years without his girl saying \"I love you\". Finally Leonard asks Penny what she wants him to do and she runs off telling him that she is not being fair to him. Sheldon calls out that he is willing to buy her ice cream. He turns to Wil and asks what he did. He asks him if he thought he would break up a couple just to win a bowling match. Sheldon figures that he wouldn't and Wil told him to keep thinking that. Realizing what happened he again calls out in The wrath of Khan Khan-like fashion, \"WHEAAAATOOOONNNN!!!\"Because of their loss (and the bet they made with Stuart), the guys come into the comic book store as Batgirl (Howard), Supergirl (Leonard), Wonder Woman (Sheldon), and Catwoman (Raj).Title reference: Wil Wheaton's return as a guest star on the show.", "episode_10": "Bernadette Rostenkowski is joining the gang for takeout around the coffee table making Sheldon unhappy.

After Bernadette, asks what is so special about that spot on the couch, Penny goes through Sheldon's standard explanation about temperature, air currents and the position of the television. Sheldon is impressed and tells Penny that there is hope for her yet.\nPenny likes the addition of Bernadette since she can have girl talk about things like shoes which is the definition of Hell for Sheldon. Bernadette is always laughing at Howard's jokes because his face lights up when she laughs. She is also interested in Leonard's experiments though Sheldon finds them as ground-breaking as 3rd graders growing Lima beans on wet paper towels. Penny feels lost as Bernadette shows a huge interest in physics.Raj and Sheldon are playing Mario Karts until Penny comes over asks him for a favor and Sheldon tells Raj to leave. She wants him to teach her a little physics so that she can understand Leonard's work and surprise him. (\"If you really want to surprise him, why don't you do something like clean your apartment?\") Penny suggests that it would make for a fascinating experiment. Sheldon compares it to teaching Koko the Gorilla sign language.Howard brings Bernadette in to show her his work and to show everyone that he has a girlfriend. Leonard invites her to his lab to look at some of his experiments. After she leaves, Howard accuses Leonard of moving in on his girl. (It's not enough you got the Prom Queen, now you want the Chair of the Decorating Committee?)Penny shows up for her lessons on time, well-rested, and eager to learn as Sheldon notes. (\"Apparently, ignorance is bliss.\") After giving her a notebook, he begins his lecture back in ancient Greece, where people would look up at the stars and see some of them move in the night sky. They are going to embark on a 2600-year journey from the Greeks to Isaac Newton to Niels Bohr to Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger to the Dutch researchers Leonard is currently ripping off. Penny leaves for the bathroom first and Sheldon notes: Project Gorilla - Entry 2. I'm exhausted!Howard and Bernadette are fooling around up in his room and are interrupted by his mother. He sends her off to the grocery after asking for her to cook lamb stew for dinner. Leonard texts Bernadette to tell her that Howard might not like it if she went to his experiment tomorrow. Howard doesn't and Bernadette is not happy that Howard wants to control whom she is friends with & leavesSheldon is trying to teach Penny physics, but she doesn't understand anything and starts to cry because she thinks she is stupid. Sheldon doesn't think that that's no reason to cry. One cries when one is sad. He cries because others are stupid and that makes him sad. Penny just wants to know what Leonard does. He works with subatomic particles. Penny then asks what they are. Sheldon considers that a good questions and to answer that he starts his whole lecture over again. Penny reacts with \"Oh balls!\"Howard goes to Leonard's lab angry that Leonard text-blocked him with his message to Bernadette. He doesn't want to look like a petty, jealous douche though he admits that he is. When Bernadette arrives, he says that he was interested in Leonard's experiment as well though he told Bernadette that he thought it was stupid. He apologizes to Bernadette for what he did, though Leonard gets back at him by putting her name for him, \"Tushy-face\", on Twitter.At the next dinner, Penny comments on Leonard's work using a complicated analysis that surprises everyone reiterating Sheldon's usual condescending remarks about Leonard's work. Sheldon nods approvingly. Then she also wants everybody to know that Fig Newtons were named after a town in Massachusetts and not the scientist which has everyone know that Penny hadn't changed.Title reference: Sheldon's view that teaching physics to Penny is equivalent in challenge to teaching sign language to Koko the gorilla.", "episode_16": "Raj walks into the comic book store and turns on the music on his speaker T-shirt, to Howard's annoyance. Stuart (Kevin Sussman) announces to the gang that Stan Lee is coming to his comic book store to sign books on Thursday and everyone is excited. Back at the apartment, they discuss which comics they should get him to sign. Sheldon decides he will get him to sign his Batman comic as it will be unique since Stan Lee has nothing to do with Batman.When Howard has a paper cut, he searches Sheldon's drawer for bandages, but instead finds unopened paychecks and, among them, a summons for running a red light when he was driving Penny to the hospital, courtesy of a red light camera. Sheldon points this out to Penny, but she denies it repeatedly, despite Sheldon's excellent memory and even when Sheldon points out the photo of Penny in the car with him.\nSheldon demands to know why the ticket went to him since it was Penny's car and license plate. She explains that she had been sent the ticket, but betrayed Sheldon and told them that it had been him because she couldn't afford anymore points on her license.\nSince Sheldon believes he's not guilty, he starts to prepare his defense rather than just pay the fine. Since he is supposed to be in court on Thursday, it conflicts with getting his comic book signed by Stan Lee, much to Sheldon's horror. The other guys refuse to go with him as they want to meet Stan Lee instead, leaving Sheldon no other choice but to force Penny to go with him who is his only witness.The following day, Sheldon has taken the liberty of scripting Penny's statement because he describes her as a \"loose cannon\".At the court, Sheldon makes his defense, but is ignored by the judge and is told to pay the cashier. Sheldon objects and insults the judge's position of working in traffic court calling it the kiddie table of courts, while he himself is at the top of his profession. After refusing to apologize, he is thrown in jail.Penny rings the guys about the incident, but they aren't interested as they are lining up for Stan Lee. Sheldon is ready to apologize to the judge because he refuses to use a metal bowl (jail toilet).Penny sees that Sheldon is depressed about missing his chance with Stan Lee, so she goes to Stuart and is able to get Stan Lee's address in exchange for a date to his cousin's wedding (though she can bring Leonard). They arrive at his house and ring the doorbell, but Stan Lee is not impressed by their act and sarcastically invites Sheldon in to watch the Lakers. Since Sheldon doesn't understand sarcasm, he takes him at his word, causing Stan to tell his wife Joan to call the cops.When Sheldon gets home, he brags about how he got a signed restraining order from Stan Lee and is able to hang out with him again at the hearing. He plans on hanging it next to his restraining order from Leonard Nimoy.Title reference: Stan Lee's comic book signing event. Excelsior being a catchphrase of his.", "episode_5": "Penny is reluctantly playing \"Mystic Warlords of Ka'a\" with Leonard, Howard and Raj. Sheldon explains all the cards that she can play due to his Eidetic memory. Howard concedes that the game is over, which first excites Penny. Penny then immediately leaves, because the last time she didn't leave, she ended up playing Mystic Warlords of \"Ka\".Howard then brings up their \"Girlfriend Pact\" with Leonard: if either one dated a hot girlfriend, they would have her find a date for the other. Leonard can't remember making the pact, but Sheldon promptly announces the date (June 30, 2004), place (Opening Day of \"Spiderman II\", AMC Theaters, Pasadena) and available concession stand snacks (\"Only red Icees, no blue\"). Leonard admits that he only agreed to the pact because he never thought he'd have a hot girlfriend, and he was positive Howard never would have one either. Raj was absent during the pact agreement due to his small bladder.At lunch, Sheldon won't give Leonard a napkin out of his 4-napkin system (lap, hands, face and personal emergency). He offers to provide a guest napkin the next day for Leonard; this prompts him to take one of Sheldon's napkins (the face one) anyway. Howard continues to pester Leonard about having Penny find a \"hot and tall\" date for him. Leonard reluctantly agrees to talk to her about it. Sheldon makes fun of Raj's sweater vest. Raj announces that there will be a \"Mystic Warlords of Ka'a\" tournament at the comic book store, with $500 going as first prize and wants Sheldon to enter with him, but Sheldon isn't interested.After sex, Penny tells him that he really is a genius, though Leonard admits that he had Googled his technique. Remembering Howard, he tentatively broaches the subject about pacts. Penny reminisces about a pact she made in the first grade with her friend, Rosie: to marry Bert and Ernie, Muppets from \"Sesame Street\". Leonard mentions his long-standing pact with Howard \"which kind of involves [her]\". This vague statement kills the coitus blissful mood, making Penny suspicious about its implications. Penny refuses to fix any of her friends with Howard. Leonard tries to convince Penny that, \"deep down inside, Howard's a really nice guy\". Penny retaliates: \"The problem isn't what is on the inside. It's the creepy candy coating\". Leonard pleads with Penny to reconsider it as a favor to him.At the comic book store, Raj discovers that Wil Wheaton-as in Star Trek's Wil Wheaton (A.K.A. Ensign Wesley Crusher)--is signed up for the Mystic Warlords tournament. Stuart confirms that Wil lives nearby and is a big gamer. As a youth, Sheldon idolized Wesley Crusher on \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" because they both had an Eidetic memory. In 1995, Sheldon rode 10 hours by bus, twice violating his personal rule of relieving himself in a moving vehicle, to a sci-fi convention in Jackson, Mississippi. He wore his Starfleet cadet uniform in order to meet Wil Wheaton and to have Wil sign his mint, in-package Wesley Crusher action figure; however, Wil didn't appear, and Sheldon pledged eternal hatred for him. Sheldon proclaims that Wil Wheaton currently ranks 6th on his All-time Enemies' List. He angrily teams up with Raj for the tournament (his alias as \"Die, Wil Wheaton, DIE!\")As Leonard, Penny, and Howard head out on their double date. Penny had told her friend that Howard is an aerospace engineer, is fluent in 5 languages (\"6, if you count Klingon\"; women don't count Klingon as a doable foreign language), and that he has an unhealthy attachment to his mother. She was kidding about his mother, which Leonard silently comments will be a nice surprise for her.Sheldon and Raj are playing in the tournament set up at the comic book store. Raj is gleeful about their progress, but Sheldon is consumed by his enmity towards Wil Wheaton. Sheldon wrathfully stares at an oblivious Wil Wheaton, still quoting Khan: \"Wil Wheaton, my old friend. I've chased you 'round the moons of Nibia and 'round the Antares Maelstrom and 'round Perdition's Flames!\" Raj remarks that Wesley Crusher was in the \"Star Trek: Next Generation\" franchise and thus, was unrelated to \"Wrath of Khan\", part of the original Star Trek series, but this does not deter Sheldon. Sheldon and Raj have to beat Lonely Larry and Captain Sweatpants before facing off with Wil Wheaton and Stuart in the championship round.Howard awkwardly tries to make small talk in the car with Penny's friend, Bernadette (Melissa Rauch). She is working at the Cheesecake Factory in order to pay her tuition at grad school, majoring in microbiology. She doesn't understand his jokes and she doesn't share any of Howard's interests in science-fiction, role playing games (fantasy (Dungeons and Dragons) or bedroom), or magic. Leonard gloomily predicts that it is \"going to be a long, long night\".Sheldon and Raj easily dispatches Captain Sweatpants and Lonely Larry in their tournament match. Sheldon balefully stares at their final opponents, namely Wil Wheaton, and he exclaims: \"BortaS BIr Jablu'DI' ReH QaQqu' Nay'!\" Wil Wheaton overhears it and asks Stuart in disbelief: \"Did that guy just say \"Revenge is a dish that is best served cold\" in Klingon?\"At dinner, Howard continues to try and find common ground with Bernadette (she even doesn't like puppies!). Howard's mother calls and leaves a message on his phone. Bernadette is sympathetic, because her mother drives her crazy as well. They start sharing stories about how bad their mothers are, such as: their mothers continuously calls them on the phone about trivial things; Howard's mother made him wear rubber gloves to kindergarten for fear of catching diseases; Bernadette's mother still lays out her clothes and \"wouldn't let [her] ride a bicycle because she thought [Bernadette would] hit a bump and lose [her] virginity.\"\nBernadette freely discloses that she lost her virginity in a Toyota Camry, while Howard admits that he lost his virginity in a Toyota Corolla (to his second cousin). This shared revelation helps Howard and Bernadette warm up to each other. Howard then invites her to meet his mother for Shabazz dinner at home: \"A Catholic girl like you, wearing a big cross like that, it might give my mother the big brain aneurysm I've been hoping for.\" Bernadette cheerfully agrees, with the proviso that Howard has to come to her family's Sunday dinner, wearing a yarmulke.\nPenny is happy that she is great at matchmaking.Sheldon and Raj are finally playing Wil Wheaton and Stuart for the Wizards of Ka'a Championship. It is a tense match, surrounded by avid spectators. Sheldon ends up going head to head with Wil Wheaton, demolishing his competitor with his Eidetic memory. Before laying down the last card and winning the final match, Sheldon decides to give his monologue speech about his wrathful revenge to Wil Wheaton and the reason for it (i.e., the story of Wil Wheaton's absence at the 4th annual Dixie Trek Convention, the sci-fi convention that Sheldon had attended in 1995). Wil then reveals that he was absent from the sci-fi convention due to the death and funeral of his grandmother. Wil apologizes with such sincerity to Sheldon that Sheldon completely empathizes with Wil's loss: \"If anything happened to my Meemaw, I would be one inconsolable \"Moonpie\"\". Sheldon becomes wracked with guilt and loses the game on purpose (with his Enchanted Bunny card), despite Raj's loud protests. Wil smugly admits he lied about his grandmother's death. Actually, his \"Nana\" is alive and will be very happy to hear that he won (with Wil's Small Rock card killing Sheldon's Enchanted Bunny card): \"Game over, Moon Pie!\" Sheldon sits in shocked disbelief. After Sheldon realizes that he's been tricked, he yells in Khan-like fashion, \"WHEEEAAAAAATTTTTTOOOONNNNNNNN!!!!!!!\" The camera pans out to a global satellite image of Earth, mimicking a memorable scene from the blockbuster 1982 feature film Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.Note: This episode marks the first appearance of future regular cast member Melissa Rauch as Bernadette Rostenkowski and also marks the first cameo appearance of Wil Wheaton on the show.\nTitle reference: Penny's description of Howard's outward behavior.

She says three dates mean sex, but wants to know where their relationship is going, and she does not want it to be a one-night stand. She leaves him to think about it.Howard asks the guys about dating and sex. Kripke (John Ross Bowie) comes up and announces Sheldon was going to be on Science Friday on National Public Radio, thus spoiling Sheldon's surprise. Sheldon says his mother is excited and has even invited her Bible study group to listen in. Sheldon has prepared his talking points for the NPR interview, but wonder if the less educated would understand. Then he asks Howard to look the points over for him.At Apartment 4A Penny enters and immediately asks Raj to talk to her. Raj is stunned. She then asks Howard why he has not called Bernadette in a week. Howard replies he is not sure if she is his type, and says he wants to settle with someone like Megan Fox from Transformers or Katee Sackhoff from Battlestar Galactica. Leonard thinks that he had a better shot with the three-breasted hooker from Total Recall. Howard and Penny gets into an argument and Howard thinks Penny settled for Leonard. Penny says she does not judge Leonard by his appearance. Leonard is offended that they are talking as if he was not even there.Sheldon's interview on NPR gets ruined as Kripke pumps helium into Sheldon's office, sending his voice up to cartoon sounding levels. Everyone in the cafeteria is listening through the radio and laughs at Sheldon, including his gang. Sheldon soon discovers the nozzle in his office and calls out to Kripke that he is going to murder kill him.Howard is relaxing in a bubble bath and imagines himself with Katee Sackhoff. She thanks him for being a part of his masturbatory fantasies. Katee tells Howard that he is hung up on Bernadette and that this sweet and cute girl is actually real.Sheldon is depressed about being humiliated on national radio, unwilling to leave his bed ever again. Leonard and Raj encourage him to get back at Kripke; even if Raj originally came to mock Sheldon. They make comparisons to The Joker's vengeance on Batman. Sheldon thinks he could kill Kripke with an untraceable chemical; however, Leonard tells him to tone down the prank at a non-lethal level.After much thinking, Howard comes down to The Cheesecake Factory and proposes to Bernadette. He tells that he'll never find another girl like her that likes him and is real. She calls him insane as they had only three dates and have not even had sex. Howard is willing to do it on her break.Sheldon has secretly installed a device above the ceiling tiles in Kripke's lab which will mix ordinary dish soap, hydrogen peroxide, and saturated potassium iodide to produce a large quantity of foam. He has even bribed the night janitor with a dollar bill to keep him quiet. Sheldon, Leonard and Raj watch through webcam as the device activates when Kripke and, unfortunately, several members of the university board, including President Siebert, get into the lab. There was no abort button as Sheldon made a boo-boo.\nA video from Sheldon starts right away on Kripke's lab computer and says the whole incident has just been uploaded to YouTube; he also thanks Leonard and Raj for their support, thus unwittingly incriminating them. Raj comments that he's running back to India and asks Leonard for his own escape plan.Bernadette and Penny find Howard at The Cheesecake Factory again. He starts playing and singing a song (\"Sweet Bernadette\") adapted from 'The Four Tops' \"Bernadette\", so as to apologize for having proposed to her. Penny also apologizes for Howard's behavior, but Bernadette feels that is the most romantic thing anyone's ever done for her.Title reference: Sheldon's revenge against Kripke.", "episode_23": "The guys are up on the apartment roof performing a lunar ranging experiment. While Raj is using the telescope watching \"The Good Wife\" on someone's TV, Leonard thinks Penny would like to be up here to see what they are doing. Sheldon does admit that retro-reflector left by Neil Armstrong on the moon that they are using could qualify as a shiny object.\nLeonard goes to Penny's apartment and finds her with Zack (Brian Thomas Smith), her date, who wonders how you can bounce stuff on the moon if there's no gravity up there. Zack designs the menus for the Cheesecake Factory. Zack is afraid that when the laser hits the moon, the laser will blow it up. Sheldon tells everyone that Zack is a man for Penny.They fire the laser and get a return 2.5 seconds later and the guys are excited. Zack is not impressed. Leonard, \"Don't you see what we've done? It's the only definitive proof that there are man-made objects on the moon place there by a species that only 60 years before had just invented the airplane.\" Zack doesn't know what species Leonard is talking about. Penny and Zack depart with Penny having been embarrassed by Zack.Back in Apartment 4A, Howard suggests getting Leonard an online dating profile. Howard's had eight dates in the last month, twelve if you count the ones that just show up and leave. Sheldon asks for help with a heavy nitrogen tank down from the roof and Leonard ends up getting it himself. Raj suggests that they create an online dating profile for Sheldon like when Frankenstein's monster was lonely and they found him a wife. Howard corrected him; they did not find him a wife, they made him a wife.Very early in the morning Leonard answers a banging on their door and it's a drunken Penny. She claims that Leonard had ruined her because she would have never have known that Zack was so stupid. He has destroyed her ability to tolerate idiots; therefore, the two of them are going to have sex which Leonard is fine with. Sheldon wakes up and is advised to break out the noise canceling headphones because they are going to get loud. Sheldon is disturbed that he is going to have to put up with the two of them again.In the morning, Penny tries to sneak out, but disturbs Sheldon. He comments on her use of the phrase 'yee-haw' used during their carnal activities. Leonard wonders why Penny left without saying good-bye. Sheldon replies that Penny went back to her apartment to shower and vomit.Leonard and Penny run into each other as she heads off to work. Leonard wants to go dinner and a movie, and Penny tells him last night was a mistake since she was angry and drunk. She wants him to forget it, but the whole rodeo thing is kind of implanted on his brain. Leonard accuses her of using him for sex and then learns that Mrs. Gunderson (Lauri Johnson) in 3A also heard them last night. (Yee-haw!)Later, Raj has the proof that aliens walk among us since the dating site matched Sheldon with a woman. She is an actual woman with breasts and everything named Amy Farrah Fowler (Mayim Bialik). They reply to her with an email.What Leonard thinks he has learned is that it's okay for people to return to former lovers and have causal sex with them. He goes to see Leslie Winkle (Sara Gilbert) who talks awkwardly with him including asking him whether \"Blondie\" had dumped him. Since it's OK to have recreational sex with people they've known before, he asks her. She says she'll think about it...and slams the door in his face.Now Sheldon's perfect match wants to meet him. Howard and Raj decide to resort to the truth. Of course, Sheldon thinks the algorithms used to determine the compatibility of potential mates are pure hokum, but that is literally the answer they gave when the questionnaire asked what they thought of online dating sites. Even Spock had a date once every seven years. Sheldon correct them that he was experiencing Pon Farr, burning lust. Raj also hid the dirty sock that freaked Sheldon out on the roof somewhere in the apartment and refuses to take it out unless Sheldon meets Amy Farrah Fowler. Sheldon curses him, but agrees to do it.Leonard comes back to the apartment drunk and goes to Penny's. He tells her that he was a perfectly happy geeky, lonely little guy, and you ruined it for me! He wants to have sex and it's not going to mean a thing. Penny tells him that he's out of his mind and throws him out. Leonard feels that he is experiencing a double-standard.At a coffee shop, Sheldon tells them that their experiment is going to fail. (Neener-neener). Amy Farrah Fowler shows up because she agreed to date once a year just to keep her mother off her back. She shares Sheldon's aversion to soiled hosiery and they connect over agreements they had made with their mothers. And all forms of physical contact up to and including coitus are off the table. Sheldon offers to buy her a beverage as they step up to the counter. Amy turns away and has a very satisfied expression on her face. Howard wonders, \"Good God, what have we done?\"Title reference: The guys bouncing a laser off the reflector left on the moon by the crew of Apollo 11."}, "season_5": {"episode_15": "Sheldon sneaks into Leonard's room early in the morning, & wakes Leonard up for the emergency preparedness drill. Leonard chooses a \"catastrophe card\", which turns out to be a 8.2 earthquake that hits Pasadena. Leonard groggily puts on his hard hat and, afterwards, Sheldon pushes him into the wall, saying there's a hypothetical aftershock.In the Cal Tech cafeteria, Howard shows Raj and Leonard the NASA press release for the space expedition. Howard is the only one without a nickname. Howard points out to Raj that the other astronauts have to pick it for him. Raj says that if he had to have a nickname, it should be \"Brown Dynamite\".Leonard can't deal with Sheldon's incessant whining (as he didn't sleep all night), and says that he's going home, asking one of the other guys to drive Sheldon back home later. Sheldon interjects, saying that he needs someone to take him to the dentist, and as per the rules of the Roommate Agreement, he has to comply. Leonard says that he is sick of the Roommate Agreement, as he is a roommate and not a chauffeur. Sheldon asks whether or not he wants to activate Clause 209, which will nullify their friendship. Leonard immediately signs so that he can head home to sleep.Howard announces that the following week, he will be going to NASA orientation and zero-gravity elimination drills. Sheldon enters, greeting everyone as his \"friend\", except for Leonard, whom he addresses as \"Dr. Hofstadter\". They both exchange their greeting, which is a list of head jerk and \"'Sup!\" Sheldon wants Amy to drive him to the dentist. Amy explains that she can't, as they're in the middle of an experiment in her lab. Bernadette points out that Howard never makes her \"do\" stuff for him. Sheldon struggles to find someone to take him to various places, and in the end, no one wants to give him a lift.Desperate for a friend and transport, Sheldon heads to Stuart at the comic book store. Stuart asks for a lift. Stuart declines, saying that he can't and that he really doesn't want to. Hurt, Sheldon leaves the store.Raj looks for a cool astronaut nickname for Howard. Howard declines most of Raj's suggestions, like \"Buzz\" and \"Crash\", and they finally find a suitable name: \"Rocket Man\". They devise a plan to suggest the name to the astronauts. Howard has a Skype chat scheduled with astronaut Mike Massimino the following day, and during the chat, Raj will call Howard, who will set his ringtone to \"Rocket Man\" by Elton John, to plant the seed.\nSheldon enters, and out of courtesy, Leonard asks him if he went to the dentist. Sheldon replies 'no', but says he found someone who can come over to his house to do it for him. Leonard offers to take him to different places, but he wants to do it as a friend, not because of a contract. Sheldon says it would only work if the full Roommate Agreement is restored.Leonard is watching television when the power suddenly goes off. Sheldon enters, implementing the power outage drill, fetching some equipment from the cupboard. Penny suggests that Leonard come to her apartment because she has candles, as Sheldon does not want to share his Bunsen burner with Leonard. Sheldon comments that that is a fire hazard, and that glow sticks are more appropriate. Leonard fetches his Star Wars light-saber, mocking Sheldon with it. Before he goes to Penny's apartment, Sheldon tries one last time to persuade him to reinstate the Roommate Agreement.In Penny's apartment, Leonard and Penny share wine and pop bubble wrap. Penny suggests they make out, and Leonard quickly agrees. As they start, Sheldon bursts in, informing them that he'll be making s'mores, and that they should not be alerted if they smell marshmallows burning. Sheldon says that Leonard can join him, but only if he reinstates the Roommate Agreement. Leonard once again declines. Penny feels bad that Sheldon looks so sad, commenting that Sheldon misses his buddy, and suggests that Leonard go talk to him.Leonard enters the room, commenting that he thought Sheldon believed that candles were dangerous. Sheldon informs him it's a Bunsen burner, and he knows how to use it, yet the marshmallow he's toasting is set on fire. Leonard goes on to say that he would be happy to help Sheldon, but at least wants some recognition and a \"thank you\". Sheldon counter-offers saying that there could be a \"Leonard's Day\" where they celebrate him. The agreement is restored. Penny enters, and explains how the power went out: Someone went down to the basement and pulled the main circuit breaker switch. All eyes are on Sheldon.At the Wolowitz house, Howard and Raj test to make sure his ringtone is set to \"Rocket Man\". Mrs. Wolowitz yells and asks when Howard will eat his breakfast. Howard yells back, saying he doesn't have time for that, and that he has a video chat with NASA. When astronaut Mike appears on the screen, he says the guys on the base calls him \"Mass\", the shortened version of his last name. Howard's phone goes off and plays his ringtone. Mike recognizes the tune, and asks about it. Howard says that it's his favorite song. A second later, Mrs. Wolowitz yells to Howard that his Fruit Loops are getting soggy. Howard apologizes, and Mike then dubs him \"Froot Loops\" much to Howard's dismay and Raj's amusement.Title reference: Leonard and Sheldon's relationship is reduced from friends to mere acquaintances.", "episode_21": "Howard got an email that Dr. Stephen Hawking was coming to lecture at the university and needed Howard to maintain the equipment on his specialized wheelchair. Everybody thinks that is neat and Howard plans on introducing him to Sheldon. Sheldon comes over describing his work on the Higgs Boson particle, and doesn't pay any attention to Howard because he wouldn't understand it. Howard changes his mind very quickly.Sheldon begs and pleads for Howard to introduce him to Stephen Hawking. That way Howard can go to Jewish heaven or stay out of Jewish hell, though he already lives with his mother which is Jewish hell, and heaven does not exist in Judaism. Sheldon unintentionally offends Howard even further when he states that meeting Hawking is like meeting another human being in a world full of dogs (he's basically saying that everyone else are all dogs).Finally, Howard compromises, and agrees to give Hawking Sheldon's paper on the Higgs Boson Particle; however, Howard has a few tasks for him to perform. \"Sheldon, are you familiar with the 12 Labors of Hercules? You should be so lucky,\" explained Howard.First task, polish Howard's entire collection of belt buckles. There are what looks like water marks on some of them, but that's not what it is (Howard stands close to the urinals and the marks are back splash). Sheldon does an immaculate job which included using turtle wax on them.Next task, he had to wear the French Maid outfit Howard originally bought for Bernadette and walk through the university cafeteria. (What are you all staring at? You never saw a man trying to get a meeting with Stephen Hawking before?)As Sheldon does Howard's laundry, Penny thinks that it was Amy's having found some leopard-print underwear. She gets disgusted when she learns that it's Howard's.\nBernadette thinks that Howard is being mean. Sheldon doesn't know what he is doing because \"the part of Sheldon's brain that should know he's being mean is getting a wedgie from the rest of Sheldon's brain.\" Bernadette wants Howard to stop until she remembers she had to take Howard's mother dress shopping. Sheldon gets the job.At the dress shop Mrs. W called out, \"SHELDON, I NEED YOUR HELP!! IT'S THIS DRESS. WHEN I PUT MY FRONT IN, MY BACK POPS OUT!! WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WORK AS A TEAM! GET IN HERE, GRAB A HANDFUL AND START STUFFING!\" Sheldon is uncomfortable when she pulls him into the ladies' dressing room.Sheldon finally comes home hoping that he has done his last task. Howard still wants him to compliment him about his job instead of his constant ribbing. Sheldon replies, \"I have never said that you are not good at what you do. It's just what you do is not worth doing.\" Leonard tells him to take it because that was nicer than anything he'd ever said to him. Howard has already given Hawking his paper three days before. And Hawking wants to meet him. Sheldon thanks Howard and tells him that he will be available at Hawking's convenience. Sheldon disappears into his room and everyone hears him shouting for joy.Professor Hawking tells Sheldon that he made a math error on page 2. \"It was quite the boner.\" Sheldon is aghast and faints which Hawking observes, \"Great, another fainter.\"Title reference: Sheldon's excitement over the possibility of meeting Stephen Hawking.", "episode_3": "The gang is having Thai food at Leonard and Sheldon's apartment.

Penny has to leave for work as well, following which Sheldon asks if someone can drive him to the new model train shop in Monrovia.\nSoon enough, everyone has left except for Amy and Leonard who, despite Leonard's discomfort, stays and reads a book. Leonard, although feeling a little awkward, tells her that she can stay as long as she likes.Meanwhile, Raj, Sheldon, Bernadette, and Howard are en route to their destinations. Sheldon is going to the model train store, as they are having a lecture about HO gauge railroading, something of which he heartily disapproves. Howard is incredulous as to how someone as old as Sheldon still plays with toy trains, but Bernadette points out his hypocrisy, as Howard has a closet full of magic tricks. Howard defends this hobby by referring to them as \"illusions\", and says that they will be going in the attic once they're married so that she can use the closet for her clothes. Bernadette asks why she would be keeping clothes at his mother's house. Howard says to think of it as their house, but that his mother wouldn't be moving out. Bernadette becomes upset that Howard believes that she will live with him and his mother and tells Raj to take her home, but Howard won't allow it, saying to still go to the movies. Sheldon tries to settle the argument by suggesting to Raj to take him to the train store first, adding that he doesn't care what Raj does afterwards.Back at the apartment, Leonard has just come out of the shower and Amy is still there, reading his high school yearbook and concludes that he was not at all popular back then. She softens the blow by adding that only her mother signed her yearbook with a remark about her hymen. At that moment, Sheldon comes home from the train store and says that he will never go back there again, due to being convinced to buy an HO gauge model train set. Amy finally leaves, but not before she asks Leonard if he can come with her to a wedding that Friday. Leonard agrees, but asks why she won't take Sheldon. She says it's because the last time he came to a wedding with her, he behaved like a child the whole time there. Sheldon defends this by saying that she promised that there would be scientists his own age.Later that night, Bernadette goes over to the Wolowitz house and apologizes to Howard about their fight in the car. Howard suggests that she have a trial run with staying at their place. Howard asks his mother if it's OK, which she says is a relief after all the sleepovers with Raj. When she's there at the weekend, Howard asks if he and Bernadette can have some privacy, which Mrs. Wolowitz sees as them wanting to have sex. Bernadette gets a little uncomfortable, but Howard assures her it will be fine, until his mother calls out to let her know when they're done so she can have a foot rub.At the wedding, Amy is having a wonderful time, but Leonard is feeling a little upset, as the wedding reminds him of his \"kinda-sorta\" girlfriend, Priya. Amy tells him that she has a \"kinda-sorta\" boyfriend, Sheldon, back home who is playing with toy trains, but that she isn't complaining about it. She then suggests that they go out on the dance floor, but Leonard says he isn't much of a dancer. Amy says she will lead, and they go and do the Chicken Dance.Back at the Wolowitzs' house, Bernadette needs to brush her teeth, but Mrs. Wolowitz has been in the bathroom with constipation for almost an hour. Howard asks his mother to give up so Bernadette can use it. But Mrs. Wolowitz says she can come in, as she won't be embarrassed. Bernadette is very disgusted.After the wedding, Amy is helping Leonard up the apartment stairs after he pulled his groin while dancing the Hokey Pokey. Leonard thanks Amy for a great time as well as breaking the head off the ice swan so he could put it against his groin. Leonard then kisses Amy on the cheek as a friendly gesture, which causes her to rush over to Penny's place, fearing that she seduced him. She tells Penny that she will e-mail Leonard in the morning about how he can never have her body, adding that Penny has a better shot with her than he does, which doesn't thrill Penny.After Sheldon tells Leonard that he has a great train night and asks him how his night was, Leonard says he had a great night with Amy, even though his groin hurts as a result. Sheldon then thinks that he had sex with Amy, so he karate chops Leonard and angrily tells him \"She is not for you! Not for you!\"Meanwhile, at the Wolowitzs' house, Bernadette comes in and says good morning to Howard. She says to him that she and his mother made him a breakfast of pancakes. Howard asks if she is getting along with his mother. Bernadette says its fine, but their communication is a little tricky as they are different people. When Mrs. Wolowitz asks Bernadette if Howard liked the pancakes, she screams out in a voice strikingly similar to Mrs. Wolowitz's that he hasn't tried them yet. Howard asks if there's butter with his pancakes and Bernadette tells him there is butter-flavored maple syrup. Mrs. Wolowitz calls out again to see what Howard thinks of the pancakes; Bernadette screams out in Mrs. Wolowitz's voice that he wants butter and so Mrs. Wolowitz calls out that it's butter-flavored syrup, but Bernadette cries out that she just told him that. Howard says that he doesn't need butter, but Bernadette calmly says to him in an American-Jewish accent, \"If you want butter, I'll get ya butter.\" After Bernadette leaves Howard complains that he has to cut the pancakes himself, never noticing his mother's traits in Bernadette.Title reference: Sheldon hitting Leonard after misinterpreting Leonard's pulled groin was caused by having sex with Amy.", "episode_1": "Sheldon (Jim Parsons) tries to solve a \"puzzle\" presented by what Penny said in the last episode (\"It's not what it looks like.\"). He comes to the conclusion that Penny was checking Raj's (Kunal Nayyar) anal region because of what it looked like to him and because Raj is from India; a third-world country, greatly disgusting Leonard (Johnny Galecki). Leonard then clarifies that Raj and Penny (Kaley Cuoco) did have sex and she lied.Howard (Simon Helberg) and an embarrassed Raj arrive and Sheldon informs them about the University's interdepartmental Paintball Tournament. He asks Leonard if the situation is awkward because Raj had just slept with Penny in Leonard's own bed. After Leonard sarcastically answers that he's fine with it, Sheldon answers that he knows it's sarcasm but doesn't care. Sheldon then begins to ponder about his rank within his team; however, this is the last thing on the other guys' minds. Leonard and Howard quickly gang up on Raj, angrily asking him how he could sleep with Penny. Raj believes that Howard and Leonard are angry that he was Penny's second choice after Leonard, and this encounter means that he and Penny are in love and have a relationship. Leonard counters this by claiming that Sheldon would even go before Raj, and that Raj falls in love with every girl that smiles at him, and just over a month ago, had been writing poems about Bernadette (which he had learned about from Pryia in the previous season), exposing Raj's feeling about Bernadette (much to Howard's shock). When Raj tried to claim that this is rubbish, Leonard recites part of one of the poems that is inappropriately worded (Oh Bernadette (Melissa Rauch), please play my clarinet!) apparently upsetting Howard even more. Sheldon then interrupts to declare that his rank would be captain.Later, Penny grabs some wine and can't find a glass, so she improvises and uses a measuring cup instead.\nAmy (Mayim Bialik) arrives, observes Penny drinking wine out of a measuring cup and comments about it being good that that she is measuring her intake of wine; saying that she knows that Penny had sexual relations with Raj. Just as they are about to exit the apartment they bump into Leonard and Sheldon. Penny then slams the door with a pained expression on her face. Penny asks Amy if she can sleep at her apartment for a while and Amy delightfully welcomes her, exclaiming about how she can finally experience a traditional girls' sleepover.At their apartment, Leonard is showing Sheldon his camouflage suit for the Paintball Tournament which he cites as unnecessary, while Sheldon pretends the camouflage is extremely effective. Sheldon has called up Leonard's mother, Beverly Hofstadter (Christine Baranski), to console Leonard. After Leonard tells her his troubles, her sole piece of advice is an unhelpful \"Buck up, sissy-pants.\"Later, Raj is seen drinking beer in his apartment, just as an angry Bernadette bursts in knowing about Raj's feeling about her after being told by Howard, who was completely freaking out. He BETTER straighten things out! Raj asks her if he has a shot with Penny, to which Bernadette reassures him that he does (although still in quite an angry voice).Back at Amy's apartment, Amy is combing Penny's hair, following girl's sleepover tradition. Raj enters, and Amy leaves them alone. Raj then asks Penny to go on a date. Penny says that she had intercourse with Raj purely because she was drunk and that it was a mistake. She tells him that she wants to go back the way they were - as friends, which Raj accepts. Before they end the discussion, he claims to her that they didn't have sex in the \"conventional sense.\"Penny gets the wrong idea and angrily asks him if he pulled some weird \"Indian crap\" on her. Raj reveals to Penny that when they were about to have sex, but Raj was having a hard time putting on the condom, and they both instead fell asleep. Penny is both shocked and relieved by this admission but agrees to not tell the others.As the boys are discussing strategies in a paintball shack, Sheldon shows an overhead display of the paintball field via Google Earth and explains his plan to take out the Geology Department. Leonard, Howard, and Raj are not in the mood to play paintball. Sheldon blames himself for his team's lack of motivation and tries to rip off the Captain insignia he had sewn on, but he is unable to do so. Sheldon begins to exit the shack, and when Leonard asks him where is he going, Sheldon replies that he is \"following the footsteps of Kirk, Crunch and Kangaroo.\" Sheldon leaves the shack, stands in the open and provokes the enemy by saying \"Geology isn't a real science!\", in turn sacrificing himself, and is shot at least 20 times. Enraged, Sheldon's team attacks the enemy and emerges victorious.Back at the apartment, the boys are celebrating their victory and toast their Captain, who has, with his last breath, awarded himself a battlefield promotion to Major Sheldon Cooper. Penny enters the apartment, proclaiming that she is going back to Nebraska because her acting career is failing - at that exact moment, her agent calls her, telling her that she got a part in a commercial for hemorrhoid cream. In the final scene, the gang watches the commercial with Penny.Title reference: Amy has a term for Penny's behavior that is responsible. Amy also reminds her that, she still is considered \"great\".", "episode_16": "To get kids excited about science, Sheldon invents Physics Mad-Libs which are very funny to him since they sound ridiculous to a scientist, but as usual misses the point on how the rest of the world sees it. During lunch at the canteen, President Siebert (Joshua Malina) comes by in a bad mood looking for Sheldon. Sheldon has to take his required vacation, even though Sheldon doesn't see the need for them. Siebert tells him to take a foreign holiday and suggests Afghanistan as a destination.The next day, Leonard enjoys the Sheldon-free ride to work where he can listen to music, until he finds Sheldon hiding in the back seat, almost causing a car crash in the process. Sheldon wants to be smuggled into the university to do work, but Leonard drives him right back home.Penny and Amy gave Bernadette a hand with her wedding invitations. Penny is glad that they aren't in Klingon, though Howard has managed to get it printed on the back. Bernadette hopes her relatives think it's Hebrew. Her father is pressuring her to have Howard sign a prenuptial agreement, since she makes more money than him. Amy had the same problem with her mother forcing her to shave her legs, which she let her (mother) do last year. Penny tells her to break the news to him in bed. Talking about the wife's dowry in earlier times, Amy believes that cute Bernadette would easily go for two oxen and a goose, while Penny would fetch a unicorn.Elsewhere, the boys try to come up with a vacation idea for the finicky Sheldon. Hawaii is a first choice, but Sheldon describes it as a former leper colony built on a volcano where the disappointing ending to Lost was filmed. Florida is offered, but it is revealed that Sheldon once went there and got his hot dog taken by a seagull. Richard Feynman, a brilliant physicist who worked on the Manhattan Project, once took his vacation in a biology lab. As Amy works in a biology lab, he decides to work with her for vacation.In the hallway, Penny tells Leonard about Bernadette needing a pre-nuptial. Then Penny asks Leonard if he would sign one if she became a famous actress. He refuses. If he's at home with the children while she's on location cheating on him with Ryan Gosling, Leonard gets paid.Sheldon is excited to be working in Amy's lab, and Amy herself is glad to have her boyfriend with her since it's romantic. Amy thinks of it like Madame Curie and her husband working together under the glow of the radium that eventually killed her. Sheldon's first assignment is to clean some beakers for her, which Sheldon thinks is beneath him. Amy explains that he has no experience in biology.Leonard talks to Raj about breaking the news about the pre-nuptial to Howard. Howard is sort of cool with it. He has his Vespa, some vintage comics, and the double-plot burial at Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery. The plot is next to the actor who played Mr. Roper on Three's Company. Raj gasps, \"Mr. Roper's dead?\"Sheldon cleans the beakers, only for Amy to say that they have soap spots and that he has to do them over again. His next task of counting spores seemed much more up his alley, though Amy makes him lose count. Finally, he asks for a challenge and has to cut the hair-thin Locus Coeruleus from a brain sample, which he has no idea how to do. As his scalpel hand is trembling, he cuts his thumb instead and faints at seeing his blood. Amy remarks, \"Sure, you're a biologist.\"Howard and Sheldon go to drown their sorrows at the Cheesecake Factory bar, which Penny is manning. Penny asks them what they're doing there in the middle of the day, which they claim they have no particular reason for. She informs them that Bernardette and Amy text her about pretty much everything that happens to them and, therefore, is completely aware of both their situations, and they quickly confess. She decides to set both of them straight. \"All right, Howard Wolowitz. Listen up. You will sign anything she puts in front of you because you are the luckiest man alive. If you let her go, there is no way you'll find anyone else. Speaking on behalf of all women, it's not going to happen. We had a meeting.\" Turning to Sheldon, \"And you fainted at the sight of a little blood, ha ha!\" Sheldon shows her his \"substantial wound\" and faints again.Sheldon apologizes to Amy and still has to finish cleaning the beakers.Howard decides he will talk to Bernadette's dad about the Pre-Nupital agreement. She warns him that her father is a retired police officer who still wears a gun, and that Howard should avoid topics like Jimmy Carter, gardeners, homosexuals, foreigners, Sean Penn, Vatican II, the designated hitter rule, organic food, or that he's Hewbrew. Then Howard changes his mind and that he'll call him from the International Space Station.Title reference: Suddenly forced to take his vacation time, Sheldon decides to go to work with Amy in her biology lab.", "episode_5": "Leonard and Sheldon drool over a sword from Game of Thrones. They decide to start a fantasy sword collection together and haggle Stuart down to $210 from $250. Wil Wheaton comes in to pick up a rare Batman comic and invites everybody to his house for a party where other Star Trek stars and crew will be attending. Leonard accepts while Sheldon walks out on his nemesis.At dinner, Sheldon compares his friendship with Leonard to Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat (he is a friend and not a friend till he decides whether he is going to Wil Wheaton's party). Howard joins them with some big news. NASA has included Howard designed deep-field telescope headed for the International Space Station and he is going up to install it as a payload specialist. Technically, he's an astronaut. Bernadette is concerned about how safe the Russian space vehicles are and the training he has to go through.In the car heading home, she is not happy he didn't talk to her about it first. He then starts to discuss it with him and she rejects the idea. She admitted her father was a cop and she had a hard time with the danger he faced wondering if he would come home every night. Howard mentioned his own father who never came back after he was eleven. Bernadette then sniped, \"Oh, Boo-Hoo! You're not going into space!\"Back at the apartment Amy wondered how Wil Wheaton got on his list of mortal enemies as everybody groaned. Convention. 600-mile trip. Wil Wheaton would rather be the lower-left corner on \"Hollywood Squares\".Back at Howard's, Bernadette apologizes for her behavior earlier and told Howard she didn't want to be the one to get in the way of his dreams. They had apparently made up until Bernadette, not willing to give up, sneaked out and told Mrs. Wolowitz about Howard's plans to go into space behind his back. She then starts yelling at him to stay on the earth.The next day, the guys are shocked that Howard kicked out Bernadette for ratting him out to his mother, with Raj congratulating his best friend for being the first one of their group to kicking girl out of bed. Sheldon, Raj and Leonard all agree that Bernadette had betrayed Howard to his mother, with Sheldon telling Leonard for seeing betrayal in others except him. Raj then asks Howard if his and Bernadette's relationship was over now. Howard doesn't know, but he does know that Bernadette will apologize and admit he can make his own choices if they want to keep moving forward. Raj then tells him the only way that will happen is that she will have to convince his mother to let him go into space, which Howard agrees to.At Penny's apartment, Bernadette tells Penny and Amy about the other night and that she had no choice, as a \"baby bird\" can't go to space. Penny and Amy then tell her that she should apologize for her mistake. Hearing this, Bernadette then asks the two if she was the bad guy and they agree that what she did was wrong, making Bernadette realize, \"Oh God, you're right. I took our love and threw it under his bus-sized mother!\" Penny thinks Bernadette needs to fix this problem, but she wants her to make certain she loves and wants to marry \"Howard Wolowitz.\" Penny and Amy bite their tongues and don't say anything else about Howard's faults.Bernadette goes to Howard in his room and asks if they could talk. Still angry, Howard says he has nothing to say after what she did. Bernadette apologizes and that she was just worried about him. Howard then tells her to stop if what anything she says isn't true, because he still is going to space. He also mentions he wanted to go to the moon, Mars, and the deepest depths of the ocean. This time she says that he got seasick on Pirates of the Caribbean. She also says the thought of losing him would be painful because she loves and cares for him deeply, while also calling him her soulmate. Howard accepts her apology and they kiss until Howard's mom yells at him that he is not leaving Earth, which again ignites Howard's anger towards Bernadette.Leonard and Raj head to the party without Sheldon even though Brent Spiner (Data from Star Trek) would also be there. Sheldon does show up and Wil surprises Sheldon with his last Ensign Crusher figurine...and signed it, too just like he should have years before. Wil is now officially Sheldon's friend. Brent Spiner comes by and before Wil and Sheldon can tell him not to, opens Sheldon's mint condition package thus ending up on Sheldon's mortal enemies' list. Wil assures him that it won't take up much of his time.\nBrent offers him a signed Data figure as an apology, but Sheldon refuses and leaves to hang around with Wil. Leonard asks Brent if he and Raj can have figures, and Brent says it'll cost $20 each. Leonard haggles and gets two for $30 and a birthday party invite.Title reference: Bernadette's reaction to Howard planning to fly to the International Space Station with a Russian Soyuz rocket.", "episode_17": "The guys return from a retirement party for Professor Rothman, theoretical physicist, who had a breakdown and went insane. The others wonder about Sheldon since he threw out his shrimp because they were all the same size and therefore he didn't know in what order to eat them. Walking by Dr. Rothman's office, Sheldon calls dibs on it, though they find Barry Kripke inside already measuring it for curtains. Sheldon claims seniority over Kripke and both go to President Siebert to settle it while he was trying to go to the bathroom. He tells them to decide it for themselves, mainly because he doesn't care.\nLater, Sheldon suggests being diplomatic and Raj suggests Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock. (All hail Sam Kass! HAIL!). Kripke keeps asking him to explain until Howard stops him because Kripke is messing with him. Sheldon then suggests various Star Trek trivia games, but Kripke declines it. Since there's so many things both of them are good at, Raj asks them what one thing is that both of them are bad at. Both Sheldon and Kripke give the answer: sports.Amy shows up at Penny's door with a huge present as a thank you for being her friend. Before she met Penny, she was a mousy wallflower. But now she's a downtown hipster party girl with a posse, a boyfriend, and a new lace bra that hooks in the front. Penny is clearly embarrassed, opens it and finds an ugly brownish painting of the two of them celebrating their friendship. She can't come to tell Amy that she hates it. Thoughtful Amy brought tools to immediately hang it which also thrills Penny.Later, Penny looks at the painting with Bernadette, who agrees it is big and ugly, Bernadette thinks that it makes Penny look like a \"man\" in it. Penny suggests that she tell Amy that she had to take it down because Bernadette is jealous. She quickly tells her not to since Amy might get her one.Sheldon and Kripke go to the gym and try to play basketball. The first one to hit a free throw wins. Forty-five minutes later no one has made one so they decide whoever bounces the ball highest gets the office. Sheldon wins and gets the office.Penny, Amy, and Bernadette are at the apartment and watching \"Grease\". Amy's mother never let her watch it because she thought it would encourage her to join a gang. Bernadette and Amy leave, but not before she says goodbye to the figures in the painting. Bernadette tells Penny and \"transvestite\" Penny so long. Penny takes down the painting; however, Amy comes back to borrow the \"Grease\" DVD and catches her. Penny tries to play it off, but Amy is heartbroken and she takes it away. Penny tries to apologize and she tells Amy that Bernadette was jealous, but obviously their friendship is asymmetrical.The next day, Penny runs over to Amy's apartment to salvage their friendship.\nThey both hang it on the wall with her entertainment center where the audience can't see it. Originally, they were nude in the painting, but Amy thought clothes would be better to not challenge their heterosexuality.Sheldon is decorating his new office, though Rothman is still in it. He is naked and thinks that no one can see him because he is \"invisible\". Sheldon sees many problems with the office, including the fact that it is directly under the geology lab: he can hear the sieve shakers. He gets his head stuck in the hole trying to figure out what was in there. He tells Leonard to get some help, but only after he takes a picture of Sheldon and posts it to Facebook.Title reference: The disintegration of Professor Rothman's mental state.", "episode_18": "Sheldon goes to get a haircut and finds that his regular barber is hospitalized in a coma. He tries to let the barber's nephew cut his hair (who does not have his hair cut records that were sent to Mr Denofrio from his mother, when he moved to Pasadena), but Sheldon bolts as soon as the barber starts to tell a story.As usual, Sheldon is driving the gang crazy since his world is out of order. Penny offers to trim his hair, but Sheldon declines her \"skills of the hill folks.\" Howard gets a letter requesting him to report for astronaut training in Houston, which he is excited about but Sheldon's hair problem seems to be the topic of the day.While at Amy's apartment desperately looking for a new barber, Amy suggests that he would look sexy with really long hair and riding a horse, shirtless. Then she leaves to have a long session \"brushing her teeth\" (with her vibrating electric toothbrush).Howard video chats with Bernadette about his first day of training and describes his experiences with zero gravity and his vomiting reaction.\nSheldon goes to visit his previous barber who is in a coma and brings him a teddy bear, tries to get him to wake up, but is chased out by the nurse, who thought he had escaped from the psychiatric floor.At apartment 4A, Leonard teaches Penny how to play chess and she beats him the very first time. Sheldon comes in, first letting Penny sit in his seat, then lamenting how the order of his life is falling apart not being able to get a haircut. Sheldon then says he should \"embrace the chaos\" and that it might be fun. Then, he decides to wear his Tuesday night pajamas on the wrong night.Back in astronaut training, Howard describes his outdoor survival test that included sleeping in a hole with an armadillo and eating a butterfly. Bernadette takes pity on him and flies to Houston to take care of him, but quickly learns that Howard's mother is already there.Back at apartment 4A, Sheldon wakes everyone up at 3 AM playing the bongos as did the noted physicist Richard Feynman. Penny runs over, very annoyed. Sheldon keeps repeating what everyone says using the rhythm of his bongo playing. Since Sheldon's world is now in chaos, he doesn't even care when Leonard tries to invoke The Roommate Agreement. Sheldon leaves, playing the bongos, and ends up falling down the stairs.The next morning, Penny and Leonard find Sheldon asleep on Amy's couch. Leonard wakes up Sheldon by abruptly banging on his bongos. Penny again offers to cut Sheldon's hair, reminding him of all the other times she's taken care of him (Plus that Sheldon has even seen her naked). Sheldon asks Amy's opinion and she says that there isn't a hair on her body that she wouldn't let Penny cut. Also, Leonard is confused about the time that Sheldon saw Penny naked.In her apartment, Penny finishes Sheldon's haircut and though he thinks it looks a bit Hollywood, he is happy with it. As she tries to trim his neck, Sheldon giggles and apologizes, explaining that clippers sometimes tickle him. When she tries again, he unexpectedly throws his head back into the clipper's path in a sudden fit of giggling, which causes it to shave off some of his hair in the back. Penny quickly covers up her horrified reaction and tells Sheldon that she's done (making sure to take away the hand mirror he's holding). After Sheldon innocently leaves, Penny tells herself that she is going to have to move after that little discretion.Title reference: The transformation in Sheldon's routine and attitude, when his comatose barber is unable to cut his hair.", "episode_12": "In Leonard and Sheldon's apartment, Howard is showing Leonard and Raj some magic tricks, as he is practicing for doing magic tricks at his cousin's birthday party.

Sheldon counters with his news that he has reached 100 followers on Twitter. Penny comes back to take their order and Amy excuses herself from the table, furious.

At Howard's cousin's birthday party, Howard starts off with his tricks, but fails to impress the children, who seem to know how he does his tricks (being able to Google it on their phones). The only thing they are interested in is cake, and Bernadette snappily says that they can have cake after they are amazed by the show. Howard tells Bernadette to cool down a bit, and continues with his magic trick (which is pouring milk down a folded piece of paper at the front of his pants, and he hopes he won't get his pants wet as he only has one pair). His trick fails because Bernadette handed him the wrong pitcher.Bernadette later goes on to complain that her mom was always busy, and so she had to take care of her siblings who didn't want to listen to her. Howard says that perhaps that will change when they have their own kids. Bernadette points out that that will ruin her body, her career and her life, hinting that she doesn't want kids, which upsets Howard.Sheldon and Penny enter a jewelry store, in search of something for Amy. Sheldon is immediately distracted by the pocket watches. An employee then comes up to ask what they want and Sheldon explains he is searching for an item for his girlfriend, as he got into a fight with her.

Sheldon says he is sorry and congratulates Amy on her accomplishment, showing his koala smile, which she recognizes as being fake. Penny brings over the package with the jewelry in it, and Amy rants on about how Sheldon is the shallowest person she knows, trying to buy her forgiveness with a gift. She stops mid-rant upon seeing the gift, exclaiming \"Oh, it's a tiara!\" Overjoyed about owning a tiara, she instantly forgives Sheldon and hops over to Penny repeatedly exclaiming \"Put it on me!\". Amy then declares herself a princess then kisses and hugs Sheldon where he stands. He awkwardly returns the hug, deciding a tiara was too much of a gift.Howard is practicing a card trick, when Bernadette comes in (after Mrs. Wolowitz announced her arrival). Mrs. Wolowitz shouts whether they are talking about the fact that Bernadette doesn't want children. Howard tells Bernadette that he was upset and needed someone to talk to, and that is why his mom knows about their conversation. Bernadette recognizes that this whole kid thing is a big thing to him, and says she figured out to keep everyone happy: she will continue working, as she earns much more money than him, and he can stay at home to take care of the kids and be a stay-at-home dad. He hesitantly answers \"yes\".

Amy suggests maybe Leonard is dying and that it would be so romantic.

Leonard lies that he went to pee in the gas station across the street, since Sheldon was in their bathroom. Leonard was in his PJs, and without slippers, but had his inhaler, which convinces Sheldon.

Sheldon comes by and asks her to manipulate Amy into letting him off from going to the birthday party. Penny refuses to do it despite (in Sheldon's view) a bribe using either Gummy bears or \"Cooper Coupons\".On Saturday morning Sheldon gets into Amy's car determined to come, but using his laptop and WiFi connection to play off site. Amy doesn't want him ignoring her relatives and mistakenly tells him (in a sarcastic tone), if his gaming means more to him, he might as well stay. He then thanks her and leaves, though not before asking her to bring back a piece of birthday cake.In the apartment, the guys prepare for their gaming session. Howard reveals that he mentioned his weekend plans to Bernadette in passing and she thought that it sounded like fun. When he explained it was just going to be with the guys, she then insinuated that he doesn't want to have her there or spend the time with her. To disprove it, he ended up knuckling under and inviting her to join them, buying her a laptop and a copy of the game. Sheldon plays the whipped sound app on Howard.After Amy returns from the party, she ends up at Penny's telling her sad story. Amy was given crap about her lack of a boyfriend throughout the party. They thought he wasn't real like her made-up boyfriend Arman, the miniature horse breeder. Amy mused, \"Think about it, I'm dating Sheldon Cooper. He's Physical handsome, he's lanky, he's brilliant, and his skin has that pale, waxy quality.\"Bernadette is really enjoying the game killing bad guys by pointing her finger at them and going \"pew! pew! pew!\" and shouting \"whee!\" to make the land speeder go faster. After clearing a group of enemies, they divide the loot and Bernadette gets a purple robe she likes: she convinces Howard to change into a matching robe, even though he worked hard for his current, better armor. Sheldon uses the whipped app on Howard to the other guys' amusement and Bernadette clearly doesn't get it.Penny suggests she and Amy play quarters, but then they have to stop before Penny gets really drunk because Amy is really good at it. Then Penny tries to help Amy with her problem. Withholding sex will only work with Sheldon once he hits puberty, and the \"silent treatment\" doesn't work because Sheldon actually loves the quiet. Plan C: make a scene.Raj reminds Bernadette that she's the team healer and is responsible for healing all of them, not just concentrating on her fiance, (\"My Howie Wowie has an Owie.\").

Sheldon asks \"Arman who?\" throwing off her tirade.\nPenny takes over telling Sheldon how much he hurt Amy. Sheldon understands and concedes that calling him her boyfriend isn't enough if she can't lord it over others. He gives her some Cooper Coupons as restitution. Penny tells him that she doesn't want his stupid coupons, though Amy immediately redeems that one for a trip to the California Science Center.\nRaj then complains that he was very much looking forward to this weekend. It was going to be just like the old days. The four of them, hanging out, playing video games, before everybody got girlfriends.

Amy is disappointed since she could entertain something like him going to opium bars or hunting his fellow men for sport, but comic books: lame-o. Sheldon retorts with two points: how comic books tell stories through sequential arts, which goes back to 17,000 years ago with cave paintings, and that Amy plays the harp-like that is cool (sarcasm).Stuart approaches and asks Amy if she needs any help. Amy requests a comic book that depicts a woman whose bosom cannot be used as a flotation devices. Stuart apologizes and tells her most guys coming there like big bosoms (and a couple of them have big bosoms themselves).\nRaj walks over with the new Mystic Warlords of Ka'a expansion pack.

He wonders what an elephant could have done to suffer from eternal damnation.\nHoward wonders about a showdown between Billy the Kid and the White Wizard of the North. Raj says it's obvious that Billy the Kid would win over an old man with a wand. Leonard interrupts, wondering what if the wizard casts the \"Helmet of Confusion\" spell on Billy the Kid's cowboy hat. Howard reminds them that they are talking about Billy the Kid and that the wizard would be shot between the eyes faster than he can ask what is Billy the Kid doing in the mystic realm of Ka'a. Stuart asks Leonard about Amy and whether she and Sheldon are a couple. Leonard answers that they are a \"couple of weirdos\". Howard asks Stuart if he is interested in Amy. Stuart says Amy didn't hate him at first glance. He asks Leonard to check in with Sheldon to see if he would be okay with Stuart asking Amy out.\nRaj asks Stuart who would win in a battle between Billy the Kid and the White Wizard of the North. Stuart says, if he answers, he will be robbing them of the fun they'd have discovering it for themselves at merely $24.95 per pack. Raj, Howard and Leonard each order one. Stuart quietly tells himself it is like Shooting nerds in a barrel as he walks towards the cash register.\nWhen Leonard wants to talk to Sheldon, Sheldon misunderstands and thinks Leonard is asking what to do, since his research career is going nowhere. Sheldon proposes that Leonard takes up teaching history, as that only requires memorizing old facts.\nLeonard tells him that Stuart is interested in Amy. Sheldon says Amy is interesting and at 14 she even performed surgery on her own webbing between toes using only Nitrous oxide from cans of whipped cream as anesthesia. Leonard says Stuart wants to know if Sheldon is fine with him asking Amy out.\nSheldon says you cannot own a person. He went back to the history topic and quizzes Leonard on historical facts about how President Lincoln freed the slaves in 1863.\nIrritated, Leonard tells Sheldon he will just tell Stuart it is okay to ask Amy out.

Penny knows that he is trying to make Amy jealous and asks him to talk to Amy.\nPenny tells him a story about a guy she liked, but never told him how she felt and he started going out with someone else. She has come to regret it ever since. Sheldon says that the guy is him. That would explain why she is constantly at his apartment and her \"baffling dalliance\" with Leonard just so she can be near him. He also mentions how she calls him \"sweetie\" all the time. Penny said she calls everyone \"sweetie\" so Sheldon calls her a \"tramp\". Penny tells him to strap on a pair (of testicles) and go talk to Amy.

He says that he doesn't have to put up with this problem because he is single.\nAmy initially desires to be left alone, but she invites him in and explains that Penny and Bernadette's snubbing her has left her feeling depressed. After asking him to keep an open mind, she explains her desire for physical contact, and makes a list of proposals involving them getting intimate, while Sheldon makes a series of counter-proposals (French kissing) that involve less intimacy (patting her and neck massage), but will still be soothing to her. They eventually agree to just cuddle, and she snuggles up to him on her couch.The next morning, Sheldon storms into the cafeteria completely furious, and confronts Howard and Leonard, demanding that they get their women in line. Howard and Leonard are confused. Sheldon explains that his night of building a Lego Death Star had been ruined by his having to spoon with Amy, and demands they get Penny and Bernadette in line and apologize to Amy.

Raj looks interested, getting weird stares from everyone else.\nThey feel guilty, and visit Amy at her laboratory to apologize; however, their efforts to do so are merely brushed off by Amy, who describes herself as a \"tumor\" in an otherwise functional brain.

He hears Bernadette who now is sounding more like Howard's mother. Sheldon shocks Howard who drops to the floor and collapses due to his heart condition. Sheldon freaks out and Bernadette insists that he has to jab a needle of adrenaline into his heart because she isn't strong enough. Sheldon does it and then Howard wakes up because they played a prank on him.

Howard needs to know from Raj if he is bringing someone to the wedding. Raj gets defensive and then becomes vague and evasive, all to cover for the fact that he has no one to bring along. Sheldon liked one wedding he went to that had a make-your-own-sundae bar.Apparently, Raj is desperate enough for a date where to ask his parents to send him a match. Since they have suspicions that he might be homosexual, they do ask him if he wants a female wife. His father thinks he is being smart asking for a matchmaker and that it's better than marrying for love. His wife points out that THEY married for love.Penny decided to pay back Sheldon and Leonard for always eating at their apartment. She cashed a residual check from her hemorrhoid commercial and bought them gifts. Sheldon got a vintage 1975 Mego Star Trek Transporter with real transporter action. He got excited and gave her a finger gun keeping his hugs for extra special occasions. Leonard got a Label label maker which was also \"mint in box\" as was the transporter. That was Penny's prank since she also got Leonard a transporter. Sheldon has a Mr. Spock figurine that will fit in. Penny wants to open them up so they can put in the Character and play with them. Both object because once you open the box, it loses its value. Penny's Mom said the same thing about her virginity, but she found it more fun when she took it out and played with it.Raj brings Howard and Bernadette with him to chaperon his date; not unusual for first meetings in arranged marriages. Also since they're short, Raj will feel like he's six foot two. Lakshmi (Chriselle Almeida) arrived and Raj is feeling good about it. (\"I'm thinking double-wedding.\")While staring at his whiteboard Sheldon sighs that it's like looking at the universe naked. He hears a voice calling out to him. It's his Mr. Spock action-figure. He tells Sheldon that he should play with his transporter because the purpose of a toy is to be played with and to not play with it would be......illogical. First he has to wake up. Then he takes the transporter out and on his second use of it, the toy breaks. Sheldon freaks out and then exchanges it for Leonard's since he is never going to open his transporter.Raj's dinner with Lakshmi went well that their having dinner in his apartment. Lakshmi is impressed with Raj and they check the number of messages from their parents who want to know how they are getting alone. Lakshmi also sets the record straight that she's a lesbian.

Two suns and no sunscreen.\") Spock tells Sheldon he's ashamed of him for switching his transporter for Leonard's. Spock is supposed to have no emotions, but he points out that he comes from a factory in Taiwan. Sheldon gets angry and throws away the Mr. Spock figurine (Beam me up.) and then is attacked by a Gorn.Raj confides in Howard that Lakshmi is a lesbian. Raj is contemplating going through with a fake marriage because he is lonely and to get their parents off their backs. Howard tells him that he shouldn't settle for someone who has slept with more women than him.Sheldon tries to switch the boxes around, but can't bring himself to do it. Leonard and Penny return and Leonard decides to play with the transporter since it was a gift from Penny and will therefore never sell it. Leonard opens the package and finds it broken. First they think it's Stuart's fault, but then Sheldon changes his story so much they know that he was involved. Several lies later, he explains about Spock coming to him in a dream and forcing him to open the box and the toy breaking. Then he was attacked by a Gorn. That explanation Leonard believes.Bernadette and Howard come over, and they give Raj something to cuddle, a little puppy. Raj tells them that he is so cute and he's going to see if the puppy fits in his man purse.

Raj wants to join a swan to have the long graceful neck he always wanted. Leonard suggests a horse for the height and genital size. Howard likes the idea of merging with a kangaroo to become a \"kanga-Jew\" that can dunk basketballs. Sheldon prefers lichens, (a combination of algae and fungi) so that he can be three types of organisms in one. Raj then switches the topic and asks about Howard's bachelor party. Howard mentions that he promised Bernadette no strippers. Raj and Sheldon want to take a wine tasting train trip through Napa Valley.At the apartment building, while Penny is walking up the stairs with Leonard, she tells him that she won't worry about him at the party since he never does anything crazy. She asks him what the craziest thing he had ever done with a woman is and that when they had sex in the ocean it doesn't count.Amy is filming the girls making wedding party gifts and asking Bernadette what their first married sex position going to be. Penny tells Amy to start asking other bridal party questions, which takes all the fun out of it for Amy.At the bachelor party, Sheldon has a couple of words with Wil Wheaton on being Howard's friend. Stuart tries borrowing some money from Leonard to pay for the evening as Howard and Raj arrive. As the toasts begin, most of Sheldon's jokes fall flat, though he does give Howard a \"double Bazinga\" and wishes him good luck. Leonard tells everyone he has had sex in the ocean and he can do crazy things. Stuart tells Howard that he has everything and that he is very unhappy living in the back of the comic book store. Barry Kripke just complains that there are no strippers. Raj tells everyone how Howard is his best friend, that when he came to United States of America that he was very lonely, but after finding Howard, he realized they could be lonely together. He finishes up with the stories about Howard losing his virginity to his second cousin, having group sex with a heavy Sailor Moon girl at Comic-Con and Leonard and Raj paying for a Jewish role-playing prostitute in Las Vegas (to cheer him up after he was dumped by Leslie Winkle). Wil Wheaton records it all and uploads it onto the internet.Bernadette picks Howard and Raj up since they are drunk and is mad at both of them after seeing the video. She wonders how she can marry a man that she doesn't seem to know. The girls turn out not to be much help to her. Amy, for instance, suggests she has sex with a cousin to get even with Howard. Realizing Penny set them up while knowing Howard's speckled past, she asks Penny why she did so. Penny's response is insensitive because she didn't think their relationship would go further than meeting his mother or sleeping together, since the signs were there. Bernadette storms out crying.At first Howard keeps calling her and can't get any good advice about women from his friends. He shows up and gives Penny a message that he was sorry, that he also doesn't like the man he used to be and that the man Bernadette knows is who he is because of her. Penny gushes that that was the most beautiful thing she had ever heard and that it came from Howard of all people. Bernadette hears him and tells him the wedding is not off, though she is still quite angry with him. They all end up in a group hug which Amy finds \"hot\".Later, Leonard meets Penny in the laundry room and tells her that they are going to get crazy and have sex on one of the washing machines.

Bernadette mentions that Raj came along with her and Howard to a cake tasting and he cried and ate half the samples. Penny points out his loneliness and decides to set him up with someone.At the Cheesecake Factory, the guys are having dinner and Sheldon says that he will now make all his trivial decisions with the Dungeons and Dragons dice, so he can free up his mind for work. Later Penny comes to ask Howard if he can come with her and they both come back with a girl named Emily (Katie Leclerc), a friend Penny knows from spin class.

They soon find out that Raj is showering Emily with gifts and start to get concerned that Emily is a gold-digger. As it turns out, Sheldon reveals it wouldn't matter much because, as it turns out, the Koothrappalis are richer than they thought. Howard expresses his disbelief, feeling cheated as Raj recently used him to buy him a Churro at the zoo. Leonard decides to go talk to Priya because of this news and Howard tells Penny that Raj also paid off Emily's credit cards. This revelation causes Penny to vent her frustration, thinking aloud that she should've dated Raj for a few months when she had the chance.

Mind your own something business and go something yourself.\" He realizes shortly after that she was saying the F-word.Raj soon finds out about what happened and gets mad at Penny. She explains she only did it to look out for him as she is concerned about Emily taking advantage of him; however, Raj feels that Penny is jealous and dismisses it. Back at his place, Raj has a surprise for Emily. He gives her a ruby necklace and at that moment, Raj's parents call, saying that they have found out about Emily and are threatening to cut him off if he doesn't break up with her. He decides to choose love over money and tells Emily his revelation, explaining that he'll have to return all her gifts but it won't matter given how strongly they feel about each other. Although Raj is happy without his money, it becomes obvious that Emily isn't as she suddenly loses all interest in him. The screen then shifts to Penny's place where a freshly-dumped Raj is crying and being comforted by Penny over a glass of wine.Back at The Cheesecake Factory, Raj is having a cheesecake to compensate for his lack of a woman and Sheldon's dice tell him to not use the bathroom, even though he has had three buttermilk drinks.

For example, when he wants her to make fried chicken, Leonard suggests they go out and have sushi instead. Mary was also tired from a long flight and was in no mood to cook anything and yet Sheldon could not see that by himself.\nWhen Raj comes over and bursts into tears from being lonely, Mary comforts him instead of making a pecan pie for Sheldon.

He gets upset and runs off to his room. Mark says that she has attended enough lectures when Sheldon was a kid and now she wants to go sight seeing.\nThe next morning, Sheldon hopes his mother will change her mind when he apologizes for his actions, but she does not.

He then asks his \"wife\" to serve a snack causing Penny to ask for a divorce. Sheldon complements Penny on the new chair she has acquired, saying it's very comfortable.

When Leonard mentions that they just talk, Howard tells him that they've got to do cyber-sex or Priya is just going to find \"some fancy guy in a turban who grew up with Kama Sutra coloring books\".

Soon, Sheldon comes to find Leonard so he can check for \"chair lice\"; Leonard says no and thinks of it as nothing but another one of Sheldon's phobias.That evening, Sheldon goes to Penny's to check on the chair. She says she had it completely cleaned out, so he goes to sit on it; however, after he flicks a bug off his arm, loads of bugs start to crawl all over him. He suddenly snaps out of this dream at home in a way that makes Leonard jump, and he quickly goes over to Penny's to demand she remove the chair from the building.

Raj tries it and he and Howard engage in French \"Internet kissing.\"Later, while Amy is playing \"The Girl from Ipanema\" on her harp, Sheldon knocks on the door and after Amy lets him in, he asks her to convince Penny to get rid of her chair. Amy wants Sheldon to kiss her somewhere he has never kissed her before. Sheldon thinks she is referring to a geographical location and offers to kiss her in Salt Lake City. Amy changes her mind and asks Sheldon if he wants to hear her play her harp. He declines, since he worries that harp music will cause him to have a flashback. Amy plays a note on her harp and Sheldon has a flashback just like he predicted.Having been asked by Sheldon to talk Penny into getting rid of the chair, Amy is at Penny's place and comments on the chair. Penny suddenly realizes what is going on and is upset at Amy for doing Sheldon's work. She asks Amy to leave. Amy immediately apologizes and asks Penny to stay friends with her.

Penny is amazed that Sheldon is afraid of birds. Sheldon explains that it is called Ornithophobia and that someday it will be recognized as a true disability and the landlord will be required to put a giant net over the building, adding that he has fear of nets too.\nPenny and Leonard leave for the movies. Leonard tells Sheldon to ignore the bird so Sheldon pulls the curtain to cover the window, noting that it is a good idea since attention is what birds want. The bird makes a sound and Sheldon starts freaking out again. Sheldon continues his attempts to shoo away the bird, this time by mimicking a cat's meow, but to no avail.\nLeonard comes out all dressed up to go out with Penny. He asks Sheldon what he thinks of his outfit, stressing that he does not want to give an impression to Penny that he thought it was going to be a date. He ends up going back inside his room to change as Sheldon decides to call Animal Control, but they just laugh at him. Sheldon draws a cat's face on a piece of paper and attempts the cat meow sound again, resulting in another failure. Meanwhile, after changing his outfit again, Leonard finally dressed up like how he used to dress up everyday to work.At the movies, Penny wants to watch a Jennifer Aniston movie, but Leonard wants to watch a documentary on building a dam on a river in South America. Penny insists on her choice and Leonard almost gives in until he tells her that he should pick this time since in the past they always followed Penny's choices. Leonard confesses that he only went along with them since he was expecting sex at the end of the night and, since this night was a non-date and sex was off the table, they should watch the documentary. Leonard even asks Penny to pay for her own ticket.Back at the apartment, an impatient Howard and Raj are waiting for Sheldon to finish his work on his ultrasonic blast machine before starting the Star Wars movie. Sheldon asks Howard's assistance to finish setting up the machine and, while Howard works on it, Sheldon shares his ordeal with birds with Raj, which includes a parrot calling him a \"fat-ass\". Howard finishes working on the machine, calling it Sheldon's \"bird death ray\". Sheldon tells him that it is not a death ray and, if he did have one, he would be in his lair, enjoying the money the people of the Earth gave him for not using it. He starts the machine, but it does not scare the bird away, instead shattering the window.Penny and Leonard are hanging out at Brady's Beer after the movie. Leonard suggests that Penny enjoyed the movie since she teared up when the village got flooded and the people had to relocate. Penny denies it, saying she only teared up because she was thinking how come the people could leave yet she could not. Leonard laughs and asks Penny if she would like some French fries since he was getting some for himself. Penny says no and Leonard asks again by saying that she always says that, but ends up eating half of his fries. Penny says that she only ate the \"little crispy ones\" that Leonard does not like, but he says he likes them and prefers to save them for the end, but they are gone before he can eat them and he kept quiet about it. Penny interrupts, answering that he was expecting sex at the end of the night and Leonard agrees. He asks again if Penny would like some fries and she says yes.

Sheldon goes inside the closet and comes out with a broom while wearing Boba Fett helmet. He carefully opens the window and tries to shoo the bird away using the broom, but the bird flies into the apartment and lands on Sheldon's spot on the couch.Back at the bar, Penny tries to sound intelligent by telling Kevin about the documentary she just saw about generating electricity and preserving the environment, while Leonard sits alone sulking. Leonard finally stands up and asks to speak to Penny. He tells her that he knows she is going out of her way to talk to that guy because he said that their outing was not a date. Penny says she thinks the guy is cute and tells Leonard to talk to other girls if he wants to.Back at the apartment, Sheldon enlists Amy and Bernadette's help to get rid of the bird. Amy asks Sheldon what he expects them to do and he says that, since they are both biologists, they should know how to deal with living things like the bird. Bernadette tells him that she specialized in microorganisms while Amy studied brains. Amy adds that neither of them minored in bird-shooing. Bernadette asks Sheldon to come back into the apartment when the bird is perched on her arms. She suggests that the bird may be someone's lost pet. Amy tells him that the only way to get over a fear is to interact with it, just like what he did with the mailman. Sheldon approaches the bird slowly, but backs away. Bernadette immediately yells, \"Oh, just pat the bird, you big baby!\", prompting Sheldon to stroke the bird. He still insists on flushing the bird down the toilet.At the bar, Leonard finally finds someone to talk to, a woman named Laura (Ashley Austin Morris). He lies to her about the stuff he enjoys such as hiking, karaoke, and Jennifer Aniston movies. Penny comes over and apologizes for ditching him. He says he is fine with it and asks her to go away. Penny says Kevin left and asks to hang out. Leonard says that she only wants to hang out with him now that Kevin is gone. Penny asks Leonard what he has been telling Laura about her, but Leonard refuses and asks her to go hang out with other guys there. Penny asks Laura whether Leonard told her he owns two Star Trek uniforms and he wears them even when it is not Halloween. Leonard retaliates by saying Penny thinks Cold War are only fought during winter. Penny responds with that half of Leonard's dirty movie are animated. Leonard replies by asking if Kevin knows that Penny's acting career involved a long-running role as waitress in a local production of The Cheesecake Factory. Penny asks if Laura knows about Leonard's lucky asthma inhaler. Leonard asks Penny to spell \"asthma\". Penny can't and asks him to take her home. Leonard initially refuses but, noticing that Laura has left, agrees.Meanwhile, Sheldon has overcome his fear of birds and is infatuated by the black throat magpie jay, holding and gazing at it longingly. He asks Bernadette to take a picture of him and the bird, saying he will use the picture on a mug, mouse pad, and calendar. Sheldon starts calling the bird his \"little Lovey-Dovey\". Bernadette tells him the bird still looks like someone's pet and they should make poster. Sheldon agrees but says the posters should have the words \"Is this your bird? Not anymore!\", and starts planning the fun things he will do with the bird, including carrying messages to all his enemies. Amy says Sheldon can borrow her cage if he wants since one of her test monkey slipped over a banana peel and broke its neck. Sheldon declines and says Lovey-Dovey will sleep in his own nest which he will retrieve from the window sill and put in his room, but the moment Sheldon opens the window, the blue jay flies out.Penny and Leonard return to the apartment building and see Sheldon's poster of his missing jay on their way up the stairs, neither looking as if they had enjoyed the non-date. Leonard breaks the ice by saying that they went out, met some interesting people and said horrible things about each other; so it was a magical night. Penny replies that she is not innocent, but Leonard calls her stupid and she calls him an \"asthmatic dumb-ass\".\nLeonard thinks maybe they are not ready to go out as friends, but Penny says she likes the \"take-charge and cocky\" Leonard. Leonard immediately changes his mind and puts sex \"back on the table\" saying that he can be anything she wants him to be. Penny shakes her head and says good night. When Leonard enters his apartment, he tells Sheldon he had a weird night. Sheldon says he had a great night and takes off the orange blanket covering what turns out to be the jay's nest with an egg in it, revealing that the bird is female. He tells Leonard that he is going to be a mommy.Title reference: Sheldon overcoming his fear of birds, most commonly referred to as \"ornithophobia\".", "episode_11": "Penny comes in asking what the guy's new Wi-Fi password is.

Leonard tells Penny and Sheldon that he was one of his high school bullies and struggles to decide whether to meet him, but decides to do it, and to \"say all the things he wanted to say in high school\".At the bar, Leonard is with the other guys, waiting for Jimmy to turn up. When he arrives, he greets Leonard like an old friend and gleefully reminisces their high school days, completely oblivious to the discomfort he is causing Leonard. He then reveals that he contacted Leonard because of an idea he had to invent glasses that instantly turn movies into 3D, and Leonard was the smartest person he knew of who could help him with this idea. Although enthusiastic to the idea, Leonard points out the scientific impossibilities this idea would require. Sheldon stands up for Leonard and tells Jimmy he should apologize for all the heinous acts he committed against Leonard as a teenager. They show him a list of all that he did to Leonard. Jimmy says that he thought they were only having some fun, where Leonard counters that it wasn't fun for him, and they leave.A drunk Jimmy later shows up at Leonard's apartment, along with the list, and starts to apologize for all the things he did to him in the past. Leonard does not want him driving drunk, and takes him in for the night (Sheldon is opposed to the idea and suggests they send a message to bullies everywhere by killing Jimmy in his sleep).The next morning, Jimmy wakes up, hungover. When Leonard reminds him of his apology the previous night, Jimmy chides him for having held a grudge, helps himself to his French toast, and calls him \"Nancy\" (his old childhood insult for him). Taking a stand, Leonard tells Jimmy to get out of the apartment and actually shoves against him, not doing any damage. The guys are then seen running down the stairs to evade an annoyed Jimmy.Meanwhile, regarding the issue of bullying, Amy and Bernadette talk about their bullies, but Penny says that she did not have bullies and just used to prank other girls.

Kripke tells Sheldon that there is big string theory news from work done at the Large Hadron Collider. Sheldon is interested until Kripke taunts him; the news is that Cooper will believe anything. Sheldon reminds Kripke that he is also a string theorist.

Lucy learned about Emily and couldn't handle it, so Raj is now dating only Emily. Howard wants to meet Emily soon before Raj screws it up. Sheldon brings in a box of his old string theory books, offering them to his friends.

Howard tells Raj that he and Bernadette are free the next night for dinner.

Penny feels that he shouldn't rush into something new and maybe something will find him. Sheldon thinks that that isn't bad advice. He got into string theory because that was the biggest book some bullies used to hit him with. String theory found him. Penny gets the guys to toast to Sheldon's new-found freedom. Finally, Amy puts a drunken Sheldon to bed.The next morning Sheldon wakes up, horrified, staring at the pillow next to him. But it wasn't Amy. In fact, he had been sleeping with a geology book.

Reading the vet's list of symptoms, it actually says that she was dreading Valentine's Day and thanked him for spending it with her, including her phone number.

Since Sheldon is absent, so are all of his tree decorating rules (including the required spacing of the ornaments.) Now, both Star Trek and Star Wars ornaments can now be on the same branches. Penny is a little short of funds this year so her Christmas present is going to be giving him herself, which is what Leonard got last year and last night. Stuart then joins them as Amy's computer notifies her of an incoming video chat from Sheldon. His sister has been in labor for an hour and is having a home birth. Sheldon then gets called away to have a family picture taken because his sister is fully dilated and there is no blood yet.Raj wants to know if Amy would want Sheldon there if she was having a baby. Penny breaks in that she doesn't think Sheldon will be there when they make the baby. Penny wonders if anyone ever considered life without someone. (Leonard: \"Knock... knock... knock... What do you think?... Knock... knock... knock... What do you think?... knock... knock... knock... What do you think?\" doing Sheldon's Knock.) Amy points out that despite the jokes they make about Sheldon, none of them would be there if it wasn't for Sheldon. None of them would know Amy. Bernadette would never have met Howard. Leonard would not have been dating Penny. Leonard disagrees because he has been going to The Cheesecake Factory for years and he could have still picked her up causing everybody to laugh. Penny then explains what would have happened.Howard, Raj and Leonard are having a meal and Leonard tells them that he is going to finally ask her out. Penny comes over to ask what they want to eat and Leonard can't even speak to her. He then walks over to her, introduces himself and tells her that there is something he has wanted to ask her for a long time. If she is not too busy he wants to know if she could tell him...where the restroom is.Back in Apartment 4A, Raj and Howard think that she got the story right. Leonard did ask Penny out, but that could not have happened if he hadn't moved in with Sheldon. Of course, Penny would never have introduced Howard to Bernadette. Howard replies that he could have also met her when she was a waitress.Bernadette explains her version where she tells Penny that she finds Howard cute. Then she sees Raj feeding Howard a bite of his dessert and then cleaning off his mouth with a napkin and Bernadette changes her mind.\nLeonard then confronts Penny that she wouldn't have done so great herself due to the type of guys she had been dating.In Penny's apartment she is preparing food and in walks Zack Johnson who calls her babe. She asks if he paid the rent and instead Zack bought some magic beans.Sheldon calls back claiming that he has seen lady things that he \"shouldn't have seen.\" According to Amy, they don't normally look like that. Sheldon then says that that is people should not be coming out of people to make new humans. Sheldon's mother calls him to bring a mop. Sheldon is distraught that despite having two PhDs, he is reduced to being the janitor of his sister's birth canal.Sheldon sends everyone a holiday email including a picture from the birthing room that disgusts Leonard, Penny, and Raj. Penny would still have met Sheldon. Amy describes how without Leonard there, Penny would try and seduce Sheldon.Penny stalks Sheldon in the laundry room wearing her short shorts. Penny is going to do her dirty laundry, which isn't as dirty as the dirty girl wearing them, who starts to undress and press against Sheldon. Now stripped down to a pink bra, Penny asks Sheldon what he thinks. He finds her a tad asymmetrical, but nothing to worry about. Penny tells him that they are going to do it in the laundry room right now. Sheldon reminds her that he is saving himself for a bespectacled NeuroBiologist who has hair the color of mud as Amy tells the story.Sheldon calls back from Texas saying that things are going better. His mother asked him to get some towels, so he left and went to \"Bed, Bath and Beyond\". Amy has now diagrammed the absent Sheldon premise and tells Penny that she would never have met comic book legend Stan Lee. Howard would have always known Raj and Leonard. Leonard never got an apartment with Howard because of the latter's \"serious relationship with his mother\". Bernadette again mentions that if they had not met, he would still be living with his mother.Howard tells his version, first he is taking his mother her lunch in her bedroom and that she didn't get enough food. Later he is seen feeding her, but she is still in the bedroom dead reminiscent of the mother in the movie Psycho with Howard now doing her voice.\nLeonard and Raj did not move in together because Raj thought he was going to be a ladies' man.In Raj's scenario, Leonard is living with him as Raj cooks dinner for a fat Leonard. Since he had no girlfriend, he compensated by overeating. Then Leonard also makes Raj fat in the living together scenario. Then Stuart shows up (fat) to have dinner with them because he wants to be in someone's story.In Amy's case, without Sheldon she is alone in her apartment crying over a cupcake and singing \"Happy Birthday\" to herself. (Happy Birthday to me, Happy Birthday to me. There's tears in the frosting, Happy Birthday to me) Stuart shows up and blows a party favor in her face to be in another story.Sheldon is back reports that his sister had a baby boy. he finds the baby irritating since he has literally been crying his entire life. Amy tells him to return to be an intelligent role model for his nephew, to which Sheldon agrees. They were amazed that Sheldon did exactly what Amy asked him to do. he has had an impact on Amy too. Amy felt if that were really true she wouldn't still be living alone. Leonard tells her that Sheldon cares for her more than she really thinks. Amy doesn't believe him so he shows that her picture is on Sheldon's screen saver along with Swamp Thing, Madame Curie, Stephen Hawking, etc. Amy gets excited that Sheldon is really into her.After Sheldon returns, Amy is walking up the stairs and staring at Sheldon. She tells Sheldon that she missed him to which he quotes Han Solo, \"I know.\" Amy also wonders how he felt holding his nephew hoping that he might want one with her someday. He looked into the blank innocent eyes of someone who didn't comprehend anything he said, which he said was like another day at the office for him.Finally, a fat Raj and Leonard are eating at the Cheesecake factory and again Leonard asks Penny out. She already has a boyfriend, a very suave looking Stuart. Of course, this situation was Stuart's Christmas fantasy.Title reference: The gang imagines what their lives would be like if Sheldon Cooper was out of the picture.", "episode_18": "In Leonard/Sheldon's apartment the gang, minus Sheldon and Howard, are having dinner. Raj is sitting in Sheldon's Spot and is not worried about him finding out. Leonard remarks that Sheldon has an extremely sensitive posterior and once sat on some spare change and added it up. Stuart enters the apartment while they are trying to decide what to do that night. Raj is excited that they can do whatever they want since Sheldon is gone, so they ordered Thai food from a different restaurant that turned out to be terrible. Stuart eats some food, looks terrible and drops to the floor. While everyone tries to help him, Raj announces that it is too late and that he has been murdered by someone in the apartment. Raj is having a murder mystery night. Bernadette never realized that Stuart's last name was Bloom.Standing around Stuart, Penny is worried that Raj wants them to pretend to be a bunch of lame characters with silly accents. Raj has them playing themselves though Amy wanted to be somebody else. He hands out envelopes which contain facts about their character including who was the murderer. The game is to ask each other questions and to look for clues. Penny asks who is the murderer which is an illegal question to ask. Then she reverses it and asks who is not the murderer.In Houston, Sheldon is enjoying his new astronaut bobble-head, while Howard is driving them to his mother's house. Howard thinks that they have to show up with something. Sheldon is bringing the gift of knowledge. Fact: Though referenced in his mother's bible, camels did not exist in the holy land until hundreds of years later. Howard quips that he thought they would get a cake or a pie, but an insult is always thoughtful.During the murder mystery night, Raj has hidden clues around the apartment. Penny is going to search the refrigerator for any hidden in a beer. Raj reminisces that back in India he was a heavy child and had to make up stories to entertain himself, so as an adult he is trying to do the same thing with his friends. Leonard has seen pictures of him as a child and he was not heavy. Raj then notes that he is great at telling stories. Bernadette finds a receipt for coffee dated twenty years in the future. Somebody in the room came from the future to murder Stuart which sounds just like the movie \"The Terminator\".Arriving at his mother's house, Sheldon wants to carry on the flowers and pie even though Howard bought them. He can wait to see his mother's expression, peeks in the front room window and runs back into the car. He wants to leave because he saw his mother with a naked man trying to be a mommy again.At a neighborhood bar and Howard and Sheldon are each having a beer. First Howard suggests that he doesn't tell her and then he discourages him from just calling her. Then Howard points out that this Mom is a grown woman and his father has been gone a long time and maybe what went on is none of his business. Sheldon feels that since he once occupied that space, he should have a say into who moves into his old room.In the game, Raj takes the gang to twenty years in the future, though his friends show no real interest. Penny finds that her beer is not flat and her rack is not saggy, so she is happy. Raj hands out his facts about the gang's future selves. Amy won a Nobel Prize, bought Stuart's comic book store and closed it so Sheldon would pay more attention to her. Penny is a famous actress in London, while Leonard is a professor at Stanford University in California and they have drifted apart. Raj also drifted away from them after he married Madonna. Leonard and Penny then wondered that they would do if they became famous. Penny is convinced that Leonard will be following his famous actress wife around because they won't need the money. Raj changes their back-story to the both live in New York and have three beautiful kids.Back at Mary Cooper's (Laurie Metcalf) house, Howard lets Sheldon face his mother by himself to discuss her sex life. Mary Cooper is very happy to see her son until he immediately mentions what he saw. She apologizes. Sheldon finds out that his mother met her boyfriend Ron at a prayer meeting and that they had been involved for a few months. Then he wants to know how long she had been a demented sex pervert. He found her a hypocrite after quoting the bible his entire childhood. Mary Cooper gives him on chance to apologize and then sends him to his old room despite him being a professional scientist, a grown man and occupying the moral high ground.The gang continues their discussion about Leonard and Penny. Leonard doesn't understand why Penny's career is more important. Amy and Sheldon's Relationship Agreement covers careers, finances and intelligent dog uprisings. Penny has no idea what will happen in twenty years. Stuart thinks that Penny and Leonard will be together because have a solid relationship. Penny thanks him and is sorry that she murdered him prematurely ending the game to the relief of the others.In Sheldon's bedroom, he is playing with his Lego and Howard comes in to talk. Howard starts to describe a similar situation and Sheldon cuts him off that they have all seen his mother naked because she never ties up her robe. After Howard's father left them, his mother started seeing a guy who Howard drove away after delivering a vicious attack during his Bar Mitzvah speech leaving his mother all alone. Howard doesn't want him to do the same thing to his mother. Sheldon concedes his point since he loves his mother even if she does fornicate like a demonic weasel.Sheldon goes down to see his mother who wants to talk calmly like adults. She is sitting on the couch and does cover a spot so that Sheldon will sit on it. Sheldon again objects to the hypocrisy after all the religious philosophy she has been promoting her entire life. His mother says that she has been struggling with her beliefs. She is not perfect, but she does find Ron's rear to be so. Though Sheldon finds it confusing, he plans on condemning her internally with an outward appearance of acceptance. Mary Cooper tells her son that that is very Christian of him. Sheldon wants to make sure she is careful and uses latex. Mary looks to the Lord since Sheldon is trying to have the The birds and the sex talk with her.While cleaning up dinner, Raj is brooding over how his game ended. Bernadette did like the time travel element. Raj thought that it was inspired. Leonard added that it was inspired by \"The Terminator\". The gang is wondering if they will all be friends twenty years from now and agree to meet there in twenty years and have dinner together. Everyone enters the Calendar date in their phone except Stuart who writes it on his hand. Flash ahead twenty years and only Stuart shows up in front of the apartment building for the planned dinner.Title reference: Sheldon accidentally observing his mother's new love life.", "episode_6": "At the Cheesecake Factory Penny asks Sheldon who is very engrossed in his calculations/ what he's doing and he tells her to not bother him since he is \"in the zone\". Amy comments that the last time he was this involved, he figured out electron transport in Graphene and who should get into his tree fort in case he ever gets one. She adds that she didn't make the list. Bernadette has some exciting news about the raccoon virus she has just acquired which is that the virus could jump species and infects humans. Howard makes her go wash her hands and then tells everyone about the song he is writing for Bernadette for the anniversary of their first date.Walking up the stairs, Penny wants to know why Leonard doesn't do something romantic for their first date anniversary. Since they had broken up so many times, Leonard doesn't know which first date they are talking about. He has done lots of romantic things for Penny, but it seems she hasn't done anything for him and Leonard feels that sex doesn't count. Penny then becomes determined to romance his ass off.In apartment 4A, Sheldon is still deep in his whiteboard calculations. Leonard looks at his work and is astounded that Sheldon has figured out how to synthesize a new stable super-heavy element. Sheldon starts dancing around the apartment chanting about his marvelous brain.At work, Howard tells Raj and Leonard that he is almost finished with his song. Leonard agrees to play the cello. Raj agrees to play his ukulele, the \"tiny ridiculous guitar\". Howard congratulates Sheldon and Raj called the discovery inspiring. Some scientists in China have tested his work on a cyclotron and got promising results. Leonard is impressed by this news. Howard asks what comes next. Sheldon replies: more testing, more success, and more fame..Penny asks Raj to come over and help her plan a romantic evening for her and Leonard. Raj tells her that the way to a man's heart is through his.. \"Pants,\" Penny says finishing his sentence. Raj then tells her that the way to a man's heart is through his stomach. Penny is reluctant to cook for him since he's such a picky eater. Too salty. Too dry. Too burned and frozen at the same time. Raj then describes the end of the movie \"Dirty Dancing\". He also mentions standing outside his window holding up a boom box which turned out to be from from the movie \"Say Anything\".While Sheldon is busy saving all his souvenirs from his discovery, Amy is helping him catalog them. Sheldon gets a message that they are writing an article about him in the journal \"Physics Today\". Amy is very proud of him. Next he picks up his copy of \"The Handbook of Chemistry and Physics\" he used in his work. Looking at it he realizes that the reaction rates he used were wrong. Instead of square centimeters, he used the units of square meters. Sheldon was off by a factor of ten thousand. Amy points out that the Chinese team did find the element. Sheldon concludes that there must be some resonance between the elements that he didn't know about. He isn't a genius; he is a fraud.The next day on the way to work, Leonard tells him to stop beating himself up. Sheldon thinks that he is getting credit he doesn't deserve and that it's going to haunt him for the rest of his life.\nThe next day at the cafeteria, Howard is going over the final details of their performance for Bernadette.\nSheldon again asks everyone not to celebrate his bone-headed mistake. Raj asks if they did not find the element. Sheldon replies that they did find the element as applause again breaks out.In a private dining room, everyone is getting their instruments ready. Howard has a keyboard, Raj has his ukulele, Leonard has his cello, Sheldon has a recorder, Amy has her harp, and Penny has a tambourine. Howard wonders what is taking Bernadette so long so he goes to check on her. Sheldon finds out that the National Science Foundation wants to give him a big grant and wonders when this nightmare is going to end. Howard comes in and explains that there was an accident at his wife's laboratory and she is in the hospital in quarantine just in case. Otherwise she is fine. Sheldon adds to the bad news that he just got a raise.Howard finds Bernadette behind glass and asks what happened. She tried to move too many Petri dishes of the raccoon virus at once and dropped one, but she is fine. The gang shows up with the keyboard in hand and Howard announces that in honor of their first date they are going to celebrate with a song \"If I Didn't Have You\". Howard plays a song about how lost he'd be without her. The gang provides backup and sings the refrains. Bernadette finds it amazing and says that she is shaking. Sheldon takes that as a sign that she is sick and leaves.At Penny's she and Leonard are having a candle light dinner. Her dinner tastes delicious because she has discovered the flavor packet that went with it. Penny turns on some romantic music and Leonard thinks that she is pretty confident. She spreads out rose petals on the floor as she walks toward her bedroom. She gave it a lot of thought and she bought him something to show him how much she loves him, a first edition of \"A Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\". Penny remembered that it was his favorite book growing up. They had seen it together and Leonard had already bought it. Penny then calls herself the worst.\nPenny pulls out a box of everything he has ever given her. Some of them are a plane ticket he bought her when she was too poor to go home for the holidays, a rose he left on her windshield, just because, the eleven page letter he wrote to her after they first time they had sex. Leonard cannot believe that she saved all this stuff. She saved it because it was him.Finally, Amy and Sheldon are in his apartment. Sheldon still can't believe that he read the table wrong and blames her. She has been a distraction to him since he first met her. She apologizes and Sheldon says that all he wants to do is kiss her, not on the cheek, but on the mouth like mommies and daddies do. Amy is getting a little breathless. She says, \"Oh, Sheldon.\" As they lean closer to each other, she hears her name called and comes back to the Cheesecake Factory. Sheldon asks her if she heard what he said. Amy replies that she can't talk because she is \"in the zone\".Title reference: The very different ways that the three couples express romance are examined.", "episode_8": "Sheldon asks where the Skeeball tickets are. After three years, Sheldon has decided which prize he wants at the arcade. Sheldon implies he wants a squirting lapel flower. Leonard finds the tickets and a sweater his aunt made for college that is bright red, itchy and has \"Lenny\" written on the front. \\ Leonard tells Sheldon to not flip out. Leonard pulls out a DVD that they rented on his card and should have returned a long time ago (seven years). He begs for Sheldon to remain calm which Sheldon does so and asks him to return it. Sheldon agrees and that freaks out both Leonard and Penny because Sheldon is being surprisingly reasonable.Leonard starts to discuss with Sheldon, what it means to not freak out about the DVD. Don't fixate on it, don't wake him up in the middle of the night, don't nag him while he's on the toilet. Sheldon describes it as an itch in his brain that he can't scratch. Sheldon agrees to not pester him about the DVD if he will wear the sweater until the matter is resolved with nothing underneath it. Leonard has said that the sweater is itchy and uncomfortable; Sheldon feels the same way about unresolved issues. Sheldon wants them to share the experience and Leonard mistakenly agrees. Sheldon claims that the video store went out of business years ago as the sweater starts to bother Leonard so he scratches.Amy and Bernadette are at the bar and Penny has not yet delivered their drinks. Amy notices Lucy (Kate Micucci), Raj's former friend at another table. Penny wants to go over to talk to Lucy because she hurt her Indian friend. She identifies herself as Penny to Lucy, Raj's friend. She asks how Raj is and tells her that he is good. Then she asks why she broke up with him by an email. Lucy tells her she guesses that it was easier. Of course it was easier for her, not for him. Lucy asks for a different waitress. Penny continues that she can sit there while Raj is at home a blubbering mess. Lucy remarks that she thought she had said he was fine. Penny tells her that she may be a bad waitress; however, she is a bad person.Sheldon, Howard and Raj and having dinner together in Apartment 4A while Leonard fidgets in his itchy sweater. Leonard isn't going to take it for sleeping. Leonard's next step is to go downtown, find the name of the store's former owner and then return the DVD while also paying the fine to prove to Sheldon that you can solve the problem without being a complete lunatic.Over in Apartment 4B, Amy and Bernadette are scarfing down popcorn and junk food. Penny comes in and tells them if they were hungry, they should have ordered something at the restaurant. Bernie tells her that they did and Penny never brought it to them. She tries to remember their order and gets it wrong.\nThen they want to know how she is going to deal with Raj since she told Lucy he was a pathetic mess. Penny feels that they are overreacting and Raj is going appreciate her watching his back.\nRaj comes over and screams at Penny, asking what is wrong with her. She ended any chance of them getting back together. Raj then gets a text from Lucy asking her to meet him for coffee. Now he loves Penny and gives her a big hug.Sheldon is in his office working on his white board when Howard comes in. Leonard found the name of the DVD store owner and happily says that he died in his sleep at the bottom of a pool some time ago. Since he can no longer return the DVD, he considers the matter resolved. He removes the sweater displaying the rash he developed and puts on a clean T-shirt. Howard suggests that he find the store owner's next of kin. Sheldon likes that idea which infuriates Leonard. Howard hands him back the sweater.At the Wolowitz's Raj is having dinner and wants to know how to handle meeting Lucy. Howard says that he can't let her know he is hurting, try confidence.Over at Penny's apartment Leonard continues to scratch himself while wearing the sweater. Leonard is searching the Internet for a stupid relative of the stupid store owner so he can look at the expression of Sheldon's stupid face. Leonard is practically in tears as Penny tells him to just take it off. For Leonard it's the principle of the thing.Sheldon is sitting at Amy's place. Amy complements him on handling the DVD situation with an impressive amount of maturity. Sheldon doesn't know why it shouldn't surprise her since he is a grown man so evident by his sport coat and real flower in his lapel. Sheldon wants her to answer the question what does his flower smell like. Amy wants to know the real story behind this DVD. Sheldon proposes that he bought a book about how to cope which told he to stop and smell the flowers. Amy asks, \"Seriously?\" to which Sheldon says please. She leans over and then the flower falls off his coat which is now spotted with water.At the coffee shop, Raj greets Lucy and tells her how good it is to see her. He ordered her a cappuccino which she remembered as her favorite and also a crumb cake which he later remembered was his favorite and he ate it. She apologizes for breaking up with him via email. Raj says that he hopes that they can hang out again as friends. Lucy explains that she kind of seeing someone now. Raj needs it explained to him that it's not him that she's seeing.\nThen he is back yelling at Penny that is all her fault. She then tells him that she has a friend she can fix him up with. Now he loves Penny again.Amy and Sheldon are now having tea at Sheldon's place. Sheldon wonders how he can conceptualize dark matter, but not able to fix a novelty squirt flower. Leonard storms in telling him that he is out of options. He has found no next of kin. He went to the Armenian church where his funeral was held and found out that no one attended. Leonard says that the search is over. Sheldon suggests that he go to Armenia or Lebanon. He is not going overseas just to return \"Super Mario Brothers: The Movie\".\nFinally he asks Sheldon why the DVD is not bothering him. The DVD was checked out on his card and could be ruining his credit score. Seven years ago Sheldon found out it was late and paid for it. He was going to mention it then, but he thought that someday this time could be a teachable moment. Hearing this comment, Leonard goes berserk - he rips off the sweater and hurls it in the trash, before yanking the freezer door open and pulling out a couple of frozen food packs to apply to his chest. Amy then comments that the whole thing was diabolical. Sheldon agrees and then asks if she knows what it is like to wait for years never knowing if you'll finally get satisfaction.Raj is on his date telling the Indian girl that she is so pretty he can't believe she doesn't have a boyfriend, which she doesn't. Then Raj explodes that he doesn't believe her and accuses her of lying to him. Then he says that he is so desperate, which he is willing to be the man she has on the side. Then the girl is screaming at Penny, \"What is wrong with you?\" Then Penny is screaming at Raj, \"What is wrong with you?\" Finally Raj is screaming at a mirror, \"What is wrong with you?\"Title reference: Leonard wearing an uncomfortable sweater to simulate Sheldon's sensation of an \"itchy brain\" when confronted with an unresolved issue.", "episode_22": "The guys are planning their Star Wars Day activities. Penny asks if that is a real holiday like Star Wars' Christmas. Howard explains that that holiday is Wookiee Life Day per the critically panned Star Wars Christmas special. Star Wars Day is on May the Fourth as in \"May the Fourth (force) be with you\".That night Leonard knocks on Sheldon's door while he is finalizing the schedule for their celebration. He is including one hour after they see \"The Phantom Menace\" so that they can complain about it. Leonard has some bad news that he just read on-line that Arthur Jeffries (Professor Proton) has died. He tries to comfort Sheldon by hugging him, who tells him to stop. The funeral is Sunday on Star Wars Day. Sheldon says he is not upset about Professor Proton's death.Later, at Amy's Apartment, Sheldon is watching an old episode of \"Professor Proton\". He feels sad that he was struck down in the prime of his own life. Amy wants to know if he wants her to go to the funeral with him, but Sheldon thinks that he won't be able to tell the crying mourners from the sick mourners. Besides, mourning the inevitable is a complete waste of time. Amy mentions that watching all those Star Wars movies is a waste of time. Sheldon tells her that is a good reason for him to withhold sex, if they were in a physical relationship.Penny dressed for the funeral enters Apartment 4A and gets greeted with \"Happy Star Wars' Day\". All kinds of Star Wars' themed food are available. Penny gets upset when she realizes she gets their Star Wars in-jokes. Sheldon is being quieter than usual but says that Arthur is gone and there is nothing he can do about. Sheldon feels that since Arthur was a scientist he would not care about silly superstitions like funerals.In Amy's Apartment, Amy and Bernadette are making a cake in the shape of the Death Star. Amy thinks that Arthur's death was harder on Sheldon than he wants to admit. As they get ready to Cake decorate their spherical cake, it rolls off the table.At the funeral, Penny admits this funeral is her first since she has never lost anybody close except for a pet pig that was used in a barbecue. Penny didn't know him very well, but she liked him, and she wants to cry. She can't so she tells Leonard to do it for them. He starts to reminisce about Arthur and starts to tear up. Then Penny starts to cry and thanks Leonard for being the emotional one in their relationship.The guys are debating which order to watch the movies in. Sheldon pops in \"The Phantom Menace\" which they all just want to get over with. After discussing other orders to watch the movies in, Sheldon gets upset because he wants to see the whole story in numerical order. Sheldon runs into his bedroom. Howard and Raj wonder if they should go after him, but they decide to watch the movies instead. Without Sheldon they decide to start with episode 4 and wonder if they should look in on him, but only after the cantina scene.Sheldon dreams that he is in the living room looking at old pictures of Arthur Jeffries who then appears to him. He admits to being dead and enjoying not having any bladder problems. He doesn't really know why he is visiting Sheldon since he wants to haunt his ex-wife. Sheldon feels that he is there because he is his Obi Wan coming to advise him as the original did Luke Skywalker. Arthur is not familiar with Star Wars and is confused when he magically changes into Obi-Wan's Jedi costume. He activates his light saber and has fun swinging it around until he cuts himself and asks for a Band-Aid.In the memorial room, Penny finds the funeral kind of a bummer, while Leonard tells her that she can rent a bounce house. Leonard is thinking about his own mortality and his regrets in life. He regrets not having traveled, taken more risks, learned another language (not Klingon) and having said no when Penny proposed to him. Penny reminds him that it wasn't the right time and then reiterates that \"THIS\" is also not the right time. The proposal count is currently 2 to 1. To even it out Penny asks if she should propose again so he can turn her down and they are even. Penny proposes. Again Leonard hesitates, but this time jokingly, and tells her that it is a big decision and is not sure he wants to say yes or no.Amy and Bernadette are fixing their damaged Death Star cake, this time with a flat bottom. Neither of them watched Professor Proton when they were younger. Bernadette got interested in science because she wanted to invent a cure for being short. Amy wanted to be in the Girl Scouts, but her mother thought that they just sell cookies on the street like prostitutes. She found her interest in science when she checked a biology book out of the library to look up what a prostitute was.On their way back in his car, Leonard is debating whether to say yes or no. Penny again asks Leonard to marry her and he considers a new proposal. Penny tells him to do whatever he wants, so he softens and tells her that he loves her and then he doesn't want to marry her right now. She thanks him and then he brings up the second proposal he heard.Back in Sheldon's dream they are now in a swamp on the Star Wars planet Dagobah from \"The Empire Strikes Back\". Arthur thinks that he is in Florida. Obi Wan advised Luke while he was getting his Jedi training, so Sheldon wants to hear wisdom from Arthur. Then they start talking about death and Sheldon mentions losing his Pop-pop and father and eleven Doctor Who's. Since Arthur left, all the men Sheldon looked up to have left. Professor Proton tells Sheldon that people may leave us, but he should cherish and appreciate those who are still with us. Sheldon admits that he does appreciate those around him. Leonard returns, wakes Sheldon up and Sheldon gives Leonard an appreciative hug.Penny and Leonard join watching the Star Wars movies with Penny still making fun of them. Amy and Bernadette show up with their Death Star cake which everybody loves.Much later the guys (minus all three girls: Bernadette, Penny and Amy who obviously went to bed in their own apartments) have all fallen asleep in front of the television and Professor Proton again appears to Sheldon. He tells Sheldon that he is wasting his life watching these moviesTitle reference: Professor Proton dies and appears in Sheldon's dream as a Jedi Master.", "episode_2": "With Leonard returning in a couple of days, it was Penny's last chance to take Sheldon to the grocery store. Any criticism from Sheldon on her performance will come in her report card, which Penny doesn't plan on reading.After entering her apartment she screams when she finds Leonard hiding behind the door. Since the project has been completed early, he came home a couple of days early and doesn't want his friends to know so that they can spend some time together. Sheldon yells at Penny through the door that not all his eggs are the right size so they have to go back.At the comic book store Sheldon seeks help from Stuart (Kevin Sussman) to buy Leonard a nautical related gift. Stuart offers him an Aquaman statue. Sheldon calls it a gag gift until Stuart mentions that he only wants to sell it to a real collector. Stuart mentions that the Aquaman statue is rare and then also recommends the Batman squirt gun.Howard is complaining that they've put Doctor Octopus' brain in Spider-man's body. Raj is enjoying the story line since it mixes the superhero and \"Freaky Friday\" genres. Howard snaps at him. He has put on a couple of pounds and even had to buy pants from the men's department.Sheldon makes a final offer of $1200 for the Aquaman statue. Stuart has suckered Sheldon in and also sells him the Squirt gun.\nAt Penny's apartment, Leonard is showing her pictures of his trip including where he fell off the ship.\nPenny receives her pizza from the delivery guy. Sheldon comes up the stairs and sees Penny with pizza. He asks if she would like to join him for the Chinese food he just brought in.\nWhen they hear the toilet flush, Sheldon asks if she has company. Penny says that she has called the building manager about it. Sheldon also finds it odd that Penny has two glasses of wine on the coffee table and that all of her take-out containers are in the trash can and not still sitting out. Penny promises Sheldon that no one else is in her apartment and that after a long day she just wants to eat a quiet dinner by herself.

Amy then asks Sheldon why he thinks that Arthur didn't want him to read his paper. Amy suggests that he found Sheldon too much of an intellectual. Sheldon demonstrates that he has already mastered the three basic social skills. The coy smile, friendly chuckle, and the vocalization of sympathy, \"Ahhhh.\" Amy tries to suggest that Leonard and Arthur may have found him...Annoying, but she can't say it. Sheldon knows she wants to say \"annoying\", and repetitively demands that Amy call him \"annoying\" - very annoyingly. Amy leaves without saying a word.At Howard and Bernadette's Apartment, the jewelry making session is in full swing. Amy is going to feel like a vixen. Penny has glue all over her hands. Howard comes in and Raj tells him to go ahead and start with the girl jokes. Bernadette is making a necklace. Amy is making a bracelet. Penny is making a mess. Howard suggests that they use his soldering iron to make even cooler stuff. The girls want to try it out so Howard goes off to get his equipment while Penny finds a pistachio nut glued to her arm.Sheldon goes over to Professor Proton's house and knocks on his front door. Sheldon woke him because it is 7:30 in the evening. Sheldon tells him that Amy pointed out that he might have been annoying. Arthur called Amy \"a keeper\". Sheldon also wants to talk about the paper he gave to Leonard who calls it \"promising\". Sheldon is ready to collaborate with him and that working with \"Sheldon Cooper\" will be a plus since others think that he is a washed-up has-been or dead. Arthur says that he would rather stick with Leonard. Sheldon concludes that it is because he is annoying and demands Proton to call him annoying as he had with Amy.Leonard and Professor Proton are in Leonard's lab with Leonard telling him that if people had told him thirty years later he would be working on science with Professor Proton, he would not have believed them. Sheldon wanders into the lab and says he is also spending the day with another beloved children's science personality, Bill Nye, the Science Guy. Sheldon tells Arthur that he replaced him with a newer model. Bill Nye finds it an honor to meet Arthur Jeffries since his show was based on Professor Proton. Arthur snaps as him, implying that they have had a lawsuit concerning the originality of Bill Nye's science show. Sheldon then leaves. Nye expresses an interest in the Nano vacuum tube project. Arthur gets angry and says, \"Haven't you stolen enough from me? Back off, Bow Tie!\"Amy, Raj and Penny are working on jewelry at Penny's place. Penny shows them some earrings, though she bought them at the Target store for $4.98. Bernadette shows up with Howard and his soldering equipment. He plans to put some pizzazz in \"Jewelry Night\". Raj didn't know that he was coming. Howard had had a blast last week so he showed up thinking that they might like to have a man show up. Howard brought silver, molds and a torch to melt the silver. Penny thinks that that looks like fun. Bernadette suggests that she master glue before she steps up to fire.Leonard and Arthur continue to working and are about ready to test their equipment. Arthur asks why he puts up with Sheldon. Leonard replies that he is his friend. \"Why?\" Arthur asks. Leonard explains that Sheldon is aggravating, however; he is not doing it on purpose. Sheldon is loyal, trustworthy and they have a lot of fun together. Sheldon is the smartest person Leonard has ever met. He is a little broken, but Sheldon needs him and Leonard needs Sheldon.In Apartment 4B, Howard is helping the girls with their handcrafted jewelry. He claims that he can take some of their hair, compress it into a small diamond using a hydraulic press at work and the diamond would contain their very own DNA code. Raj complains that Howard makes fun of him coming to girls' night and now he is ruining it for everyone. Howard asks Raj what is wrong. Raj tells him that he comes to girls' night so that he can open up about his feelings. Raj is more comfortable talking to the girls since they don't make fun of him and his feminine activities. Howard apologizes since he didn't know that his joking around hurt.Later in Apartment 4A, Arthur Jeffries visits Sheldon. Sheldon is surprised that he was there. So was Arthur who started to see a bright white light about the third floor. Sheldon offers to get Leonard, however Arthur came to see Sheldon. Arthur asks him to look at his paper and Sheldon tells him that it would be an honor. Then Sheldon adds that he hacked into Arthur's email account and already read it. Arthur asks what he thinks. Sheldon starts with he thinks its pathetic using his birth date as a password. The paper, Sheldon feels, is inspired. Arthur thanks him.Finally, to show friendship, Raj makes a belt buckle for Howard, which displays a transparent miniature of light saber that can be lit. And he then reveals he also made one for himself, and says they can have a \"little sword fights\" that have sexual overtones.Back at Sheldon's apartment, Sheldon is now describing his eighth favorite episode of the Professor Proton series which was the Alka-Seltzer rocket. Arthur is not looking happy. Leonard again apologizes that Sheldon really can't help it. Arthur then asks if Penny has any single grandmothers. Penny does, however; they are married. He then wonders if they are happily married. Penny give him a noncommittal response.Title reference: Dr. Jeffries approaching Leonard to read his paper over Sheldon, allowing Sheldon to become \"friends\" with Bill Nye.", "episode_14": "Sheldon, Leonard, Howard and Raj are in apartment 4A waiting to the San Diego Comic-Con ticket website to open. As the clock ticks down to zero, Raj needs to pee and Leonard whips out his inhaler. When the site opens, the guys keep hitting their \"refresh\" keys to get in.Ten minutes later, the guys are getting tired of hitting their refresh keys when Leonard gets on-line. Leonard is number 50,211 in line and only Tuesday and Sunday tickets are left. Then Tuesday tickets are sold out. Sheldon complains that Sunday is the worst day, no good panels and the only T-shirt sizes left are small and XXXXL. Then Sunday fills up. Everything is sold out and the guys can't believe they're not going to Comic-Con.At the Caltech cafeteria, Sheldon announces that he is going to start up his own comic book convention. Howard, Raj and Leonard are just going to get tickets from scalpers. Sheldon will have nothing to do with it because not only is it wrong, but you get banned from ComicCon for life. Even Comic-Con was started by one lone dreamer like Sheldon whose idea he plans to rip off.Sheldon is at his computer speaking with Robert Downey, Jr.'s representative on the phone to get him to be on a panel at the Sheldon comic convention. Sheldon tells him that since he sat through Iron Man 2, Robert Downey, Jr. owes him two hours of his time. Even Wil Wheaton turned Sheldon down because he had to wash his beard that day. Sheldon needs Leonard to call Stan Lee, Leonard Nimoy and Bill Nye since legally he can't contact them due to his restraining orders. He adds Carrie Fisher to that list because she can be somewhat nuts.Penny's Posse is hanging out at in apartment 4B. Penny can't believe that Leonard's spending hundreds to get into ComicCon. Howard is getting a big advance on his allowance. Amy first claims that Sheldon starting his own convention sounded more sensible until she realizes how silly that sounded. The girls want to do something grown-up. Penny is against going to a museum, while Bernadette suggests a local hotel that serves afternoon tea.Since Sheldon is not going with them, the remaining nerds need a three-person group costume idea. One idea is The Fantastic Four with Susan Storm, the Invisible Girl staying invisible. Sheldon enters saying that he is planning to ask James Earl Jones, the voice of Darth Vader, to appear at his convention. Through his Twitter and some Internet research, he knows that James Earl Jones will be having sushi at his favorite restaurant. Sheldon insists that they are going to get into trouble being banned from Comic-Con and charged with petty theft.Later at the apartment, Howard tells them that his scalper is on the way over. Then Raj wonders if this guy wants to steal their money, their kidneys or their very skin, backing up this reasoning by saying that his dark skin doesn't show stains. Leonard says that they should have met him at a neutral place. Howard figures that Leonard's apartment is a neutral place.At their afternoon tea, the girls are dressed up, Amy in her tiara, and are surrounded by mothers with their young daughters all having tea. They are not feeling very grown up especially since the waiter thought Bernadette was Penny's daughter.As James Earl Jones looks over his menu, he sees Sheldon smiling down at him. He asks if Sheldon likes the Star Wars movies and Sheldon nods. He has made other movies, but James figures that Sheldon doesn't like them. Finally Mr. Jones admits that he likes Star Wars too and invites Sheldon to join him.While waiting for the scalper, Raj verifies that what Sheldon said about being charged with petty theft. First Leonard thinks that it might be a bad idea and then decides that they should try and be bad asses.At dinner, Mr. Jones was telling how when he thought Darth Vader was lying about him being Luke's father when he first read the script. Sheldon agrees with him. Then JEJ wants them to make a night of it since he has a Lion King residual check burning a hole in his pocket and his wife is out of town.The girls are at the hotel bar lamenting how their afternoon tea was a bust though the little girls were jealous of Amy's tiara. Then they start to question when they first really felt grown up. Even though Bernadette is married, she still feels like she is pretending (she still wear clothes from Gap Kids). Amy doesn't feel that way since she has never had sex. Bernie then quips that if that were true, Penny would be the oldest one there.Howard notified Leonard and Raj that their contact is on the way up. They wonder what the worst thing that could happen to them, but then mention getting research grants and Raj possibly trying to get American citizenship. They would have to disclose any criminal convictions. Howard then agrees to handle it; he shuts off the lights and tells everybody to be quiet.Sheldon and James are having ice cream and Sheldon keeps asking him questions beginning with \"Is it true...\" JEJ keeps acknowledging Sheldon's trivia and Sheldon tells him that he could listen to his sequence of stories all night.While adding up the check, Penny wants to know what is so great about being grown up. Car insurance, mortgages, leaving notes when you hit a parked car. Though they think the guys are having more fun, they are all huddled in the kitchen while their scalper bangs on the apartment door.Sheldon and James are on top of a Ferris Wheel at a carnival, Sheldon holding a big stuffed bear. Sheldon calls out that he is with James Earl Jones who is nicer than one would ever think. Then, they are approaching Carrie Fisher's house, Princess Leia from the Star Wars movies. They ring her doorbell and run because she is a little crazy. Carrie Fisher runs out with a baseball bat yelling that it is not funny anymore and that she knows it is James Earl Jones.\nFinally, they are in a sauna talking about their trip to a strip club. Sheldon wanted to know how much it would cost to get the girl off his lap. When Sheldon discussed about a convention, James Earl Jones offers to take all the guys as his guests to Comic-Con. In the end, he is telling a story involving Beau Bridges, Jeff Bridges, Marlon Brando and Angie Dickinson.

He says that after their dad's death it is Sheldon's responsibility to make sure that Missy chooses a suitable partner. Also since Missy shares Sheldon's DNA, within her future progeny is the possibility of giving birth to another genius like Sheldon.Sheldon agrees with Leonard hypothesis and deems all three guys to be unsuitable for her. Sheldon believes that since Missy shares his DNA, inside of her is a potential for another him (a boy genius). Leonard is lactose intolerant, Raj cant speak to women without experimental medication and Howard doesn't have a PhD and is a tiny man who lives with his mother.\nAs a side effect of Raj's medication, he has no control over his motor skills and sometimes his hand gestures fail to stop, once he has made themOn learning of Sheldon's plan to find her a suitable mate (Sheldon was challenging Leonard that he can sleep with Missy if he can eat a slice of cheese without farting), Missy confronts her brother, and after she kicks him in the groin (when he suggests that if she wont mate with a man of his choice, then she should donate her eggs.. he plans to impregnate the eggs with the sperm of a suitable male, and then implant the eggs back into Missy, so that everybody wins) he agrees she can date whoever she likes.Meanwhile the guys decide that there is no point hitting on her at once, and they should take turns. Leonard wins the video game competition (a boxing match on Nintendo Wii) between the 3 and is the first to get a shot at Missy.\nLeonard approaches Penny's apartment (who is still dating Mike) and seeks Missy for a dinner date.

Raj suggests the Bengal tigers, but Sheldon argues that pound for pound the ants are the most ferocious warriors in the animal kingdom. Raj mocks that at least no-one can incinerate a Bengal Tiger with a magnifying glass.\nHe wont let anyone else on the team answer any questions. The group had asked Penny to host a mock competition for them to test their readiness, but it descends into a fight as Sheldon wont allow anyone else to answer any questions.\nHe nominates himself as the team captain (he even suggests a Star Trek based theme uniform where Sheldon would don the Captain's Gold, while the rest would wear the crewman's red colored uniforms), and they eject him from the team.Sheldon, upset, vows to form his own team and compete against them. The guys, in need of a fourth member, ask Leslie Winkle. She at first declines, but accepts on hearing they are opposing Sheldon, who has often criticized her research and gender.

The contest is really close (with both teams going head to head) and by the last question the PMS is leading the AA 1175 to 1150. The last question is worth 100 points.The last question is an equation that needs to be solved to get the answer. Leonard presses the buzzer, but didn't know the answer.

Sheldon postulates that it is a feat of strength similar to leaping tall buildings. He has energy storing Kryptonian skin cells that help him fly at night.\nWhen Sheldon and Leonard carry a box of flat pack furniture (3 flights of stairs & reasonably heavy) that came for Penny (Sheldon is sure that this favor for Penny wont increase Leonard's chances of having sex with her), Sheldon is deeply disturbed at how messy and disorganized her apartment is.Later that night, while Penny sleeps, the obsessive-compulsive Sheldon, unable to sleep, sneaks into her apartment to organize and clean it. Leonard finds out and reluctantly helps him.\nSheldon asks Leonard to speak in a lower register as evolution has made women more sensitive to higher registers so that they can hear their crying babies.The next morning, Penny is furious to discover that the guys had been in her apartment while she was asleep in her bedroom.

Leonard was still happy since there was cake and he got to meet all his cousins that night.Penny decides to throw him a surprise party, and blackmails Sheldon to join (Sheldon dislikes Bday parties, since he had to wear pointy hats, sweaty bouncy castles, blindfolded for hitting the donkey game. He also dislikes Dancing and other forms of alcohol induced frivolity) in by threatening to draw a smiley face on one of his mint condition comic books, without telling him which one she ruined.However, on the day of the party, Penny discovers Sheldon has not yet bought a present (Sheldon finds the idea of gift giving pointless as its a never ending cycle till death, leaving one party into the debt of the other), so she has to drive him to a computer store to buy one (Howard asks Penny to tell Sheldon that its a non-optional social convention).\nAt the computer store, Sheldon wants to buy Leonard a DVD burner, which he needs.

He proposes a bio-chemical experiment and Leslie figures that he is asking her out. In an experiment to strip the usual dating procedure to its essentials, she suggests fast forwarding to a kiss (which would eventually determine their sexual compatibility and their mutual desire to move forward to a sexual relationship). The whole exchange is very science oriented and hypothesis based..\nShe finds their kiss good but unexciting (she claims she had no arousal, which kind of perplexes Leonard, who takes this as an evaluation of his performance as a kisser), so she turns him down.As Leonard becomes more depressed (Howard takes the guys to a salsa class with old women, where Howard goes to pick up desperate cougars when he needs a hook-up), thinking of buying a cat (hypoallergenic in view of Sheldon's asthma - though in later episodes Leonard is the one with asthma.. possible names include Einstein, Newton and Admiral Fuzzy Boots), Sheldon points out Leonard was not actually rejected by Penny as he never asked her out, so Leonard asks her out to dinner.\nAs she misinterprets this as an invitation to hang out with all the guys for dinner at their apartment.Before the \"date\" Leonard is sweating bullets.

Leonard, now excited, regains his confidence, but he accidentally hurts himself and Penny has to take him home (Leonard vomits on the way back, in Penny's car.. he manages to vomit mostly outside the car and it is suggested that some of the vomit lands up on a biker on the road).

If Penny was to check the schedule on the symposium website, she would figure out that there is no symposium on the day of her performance. He devises an intricate lie about Sheldon's non-existent substance-addicted cousin \"Leopold Houston\" (or Lee) needing an intervention on the night of her play.Sheldon aims to spin an undetectable web of lies. Leopold has a Facebook page, a blog that chronicles his descent into substance abuse, and a desperate, but hopeful, listing on e-harmony.com for a possible mate. Leonard is to take Sheldon since the intervention is in Long Beach and Sheldon doesn't drive. Now the lie from Leonard is for a noble purpose, to spare Sheldon the embarrassment of admitting that he has a substance addict for a cousin. So, now Penny is expecting Leonard to lie about going to a symposium, while Sheldon and Leonard pretend to go to the intervention in Long Beach. Penny even defends Leonard and Sheldon in front of Howard and Raj when they are angry about not being invited to the symposium.Sheldon is very obsessed with his lie's credibility.

Leonard also owns a Battlestar Galactica flight suit, which he says he didn't wear to Penny's costume party, since it is a flight suit and not a costume.\nFinding nothing else for Leonard to wear, the duo finalize the corduroy suit.. Leonard also has a 2 sided tie which Penny abhors.Leonard shows up to the conference with Penny, Howard and Raj. The conference has an audience of 25, which Leonard explains is \"Woodstock\" for a particle physics conference.. Leonard starts with a joke to get over his nervousness and closes strongly\nSheldon appears at the conference (he was sitting hidden at the back and reveals himself at the end of Leonard's presentation) and tries to discredit Leonard's presentation (he says that Leonard skipped over the part about how Sheldon got the inspiration for the research while strolling in the park and observing behavior of randomly running kids.. Leonard says that this is simply an anecdote and not central to the hypothesis or the experiment) by attempting to \"blow up\" Leonard's head with his mind a la the movie Scanners, starting a physical altercation between the two.Howard films the fight on his cellphone and puts it on YouTube (the video starts trending on social media), but angers Penny by also posting a photo on Facebook of her sleeping on his shoulder during the presentation, entitled \"Me and my girlfriend\".

Leonard was hoping that it would sell for thousands of dollars and just wanted to be part of the experience and bid $800 on it. But to his surprise and horror, there were no more bids on the auction..The guys had each put in $200 to help Leonard buy the machine for $800. When the machine arrives at their apartment lobby, they figure out its a full sized replica and not a miniature, which is why there were no bids on it.\nThe men's efforts to move the cumbersome object into the apartment cause Penny to lose a work shift (Sheldon had proposed that Penny goes to the roof, jump to the other building and take their stairs. But the gaps was 3 feet and she scraped her knee, the door was locked, so she took the fire escape which ended at the 3rd floor. She had to enter the apartment of an Armenian family who insisted she stay for lunch. It was 8 courses of lamb and they tried to fix her up with their son), and she lashes out at them for their obsession with childish memorabilia.This upsets Leonard, who decides to sell all his collectibles. Raj offers to buy his time machine share for $300 but wants the machine installed in his balcony. But Sheldon offers more money to Leonard to keep the machine in his apartment.His friends try to dissuade him, but they also want his collectibles and argue over who should get what. Howard offers to pay Leonard $2600 from his Bar-Mitzvah bonds and 2 trees in Israel for his entire collection, but Leonard refuses since he knows that if he sells to any one of his friends, the other 2 will be very upset.\nSheldon tries to block Leonard's way, upon which Leonard threatens to remove a mint condition Jordy action figure (without his visor) from its box, which would make it lose all its value.. The guys argue over Leonards actions, which gains Penny's attention who comes out of her apartment.Sheldon later accuses Penny of hypocrisy, pointing out her own love of such things as Hello Kitty or Care Bears or My Little Ponies. Penny apologizes to Leonard (says she was upset the previous day) and dissuades him from abandoning the things he loves; he decides to keep his belongings.\nHis hope of a relationship with her is thus very briefly renewed until her current boyfriend Mike (Andrew Walker) appears and pulls her into her apartment.\nSheldon later has nightmares of being attacked by Morlocks (in the first nightmare, Sheldon lands in a distant future where he is attacked by Morlocks, and wakes up in the 2nd nightmare where he agrees with Leonard to remove the machine only to find that Leonard had hired Morlocks to move the machine, who again attack Sheldon), and persuades Leonard to return the time machine replica.Title reference: Leonard getting rid of his collectibles, which Howard refers to as \"Nerdvana\".", "episode_17": "Penny furiously breaks up with Mike after he posts details of their sex life on his blog.

The smashed iPod is later picked up by Raj who plans to sell it on eBay marked as \"slightly used\"..\nHoward immediately gets searching for it on the internet, but cannot find it even after spending a lot of effort on it\nSheldon, determined to prove that the Chinese restaurant uses oranges instead of tangerines in their \"Tangerine chicken\", asks Howard to teach him Mandarin. The learning doesn't go too well and Sheldon keeps testing his knowledge with Chinese origin folks at the university, by making inappropriate comments (in Mandarin that he doesn't understand) and making them uncomfortableLeonard goes to comfort Penny, who makes him read Mike's blog. When Penny laments her choice of men (either she chooses losers or she chooses good men and then turns them into losers), Leonard kind of argues into a position (Leonard says that the blog is actually not that bad and portrays Penny as a warm and affectionate woman) where Penny realizes that she never gave Mike a chance to explain what he did (maybe that blog was his way of showing his love for her) and goes after him as she also feels that she over-reacted.\nLeonard is again devastated as this was not the outcome he was hoping for.Penny comes back and yells at Leonard since Mike was already having sex with someone else. Raj is astonished that Leonard managed to screw-up the screw-up. Leonard consoles her & Penny says that she is done with the \"typical\" guys that she usually goes with, and wants to date the \"nice\" guys for a change. Seeing this as an opening, Leonard awkwardly asks her out. Penny takes a moment and agrees to go out for dinner with Leonard.After a few days, both worry that this relationship could ruin their friendship, and each seeks Sheldon's advice. For Penny, Leonard is not the type of guy she usually goes out with.\nSheldon uses the \"Schr\u00f6dinger's cat\" thought experiment (A cat in a box with a vial of poison, that can break open at any time. Till the box is opened, the cat can be thought of as both alive and dead the same time) to explain that the date has both \"good\" and \"bad\" possible outcomes, and the only way to determine which outcome is to go on the date.When Leonard arrives to pick up Penny, he mentions the thought experiment and kisses her passionately. She concludes that \"the cat is alive\" and they leave for dinner. Leonard and Penny go to the Chinese restaurant, but they leave before entering on seeing Sheldon arguing with the owner in Mandarin, and doing it very badly (The Sheldon says random things in Mandarin which convey no meaning and the owner thinks Sheldon is crazy), disturbing the patrons.Title reference: The Chinese Tangerine chicken which Sheldon believed was actually prepared with oranges.", "episode_11": "Penny returns from visiting family in Nebraska, but mentions while picking up mail from Leonard that most of her relatives became sick. Sheldon, a Germophobe according to Leonard, freaks out (he takes a germ culture from his throat and considers all doctors working in hospitals as inferior to his own intellect.. he is not happy about putting his own life in their hands) and becomes sick, becoming demanding (He demands that Leonard take his throat swab, and put a pancake measuring cup in the bathroom to measure his urine output to check if his kidney's are shutting down) on top of his already obnoxious personality.Familiar with Sheldon being sick, Leonard and the guys hide from him at a Planet of the Apes series marathon, leaving Penny to care for Sheldon. Leonard lies to Sheldon that he was called into work at 6 30 am on a Sunday. Leonard calls to warn Howard, who impersonates his own mother on the phone when Sheldon calls and says that Howard is still sleeping and to call his own mother to take care of him. This warning protocol was put in place when Sheldon had an ear infection a few yrs back.\nSheldon shows up at the cheesecake factory, looking for soup. Penny has no choice but to leave her work shift and take Sheldon back home, as he was infecting her entire stationSheldon tells Penny that he has never been sick alone before and needs someone to take care of him. The last time he was alone was in Germany, when he was 15 and a visiting professor. His mother was called back to the US when his father fell sick. Sheldon ended up getting an enema as he didn't know the local language and the local nurse misunderstood him.\nHe makes Penny rub Vaporub on his chest and sing soft kitty (which he teaches her).However, Leonard breaks his glasses in the cinema and has to retrieve his spare pair from the apartment, piloted by Howard and Raj using a laptop, an endoscope, and a Bluetooth helmet camera worn by the short-sighted Leonard. Leonard has to crawl on his hands and legs (and guided by Howard and Raj's directions) to get close to his room.. he tries to place a sensor in front of Sheldon's door, that would beep and warn everyone just in case Sheldon got up and started moving around.Penny intercepts Leonard and abandons him to his fate with Sheldon. Leonard tries to escape, but runs into a wall and nearly knocks himself out.\nIn the end, injured Leonard and sick Sheldon sit miserably on the couch. Sheldon eats a grilled cheese sandwich while Leonard applies a cold pack to his headTitle reference: Sheldon's urine measuring cup, which is the same cup Leonard uses to mix pancake batter.

She wants Leonard to play cello in her string quartet as the other players are uncomfortable near the current cellist who was possibly irradiated at work (he worked at the high energy particle lab, and was involved in some sort of an accident, where it is suggested that some radiation leak took place).\nPenny comments that Leonard and Leslie make a cute couple and Leonard drives Sheldon nuts asking what it means. Leonard is not able to decide if Penny is jealous about his possible hook-up with Leslie or is genuinely happy that Leonard is in a relationship now. Sheldon, as usual, could not care less about Leonard's predicament\nMeanwhile Sheldon is not happy that he is being forced to try a new burger at the cheesecake factory, as he usually he eats his burgers at the Big Boy.. it is established that Sheldon dislikes change and prefers continuity over everything elseAfter the quartet practice in Leonard and Sheldon's apartment, Leslie seduces Leonard for the night (surprising Leonard since she turned him down earlier) (Leonard also confirms that there is nothing going on with Penny, when she asks).. Leslie and Leonard fast pace their quartet practice as a way of foreplay, and quickly retire to Leonard's room for sex\nSheldon is very uneasy, and he repeatedly asks Penny's advice (there is a tie hanging on Leonard's door). Penny says everyone knows this as they went to college. Sheldon comments that he was 11 yrs old when he went to college and doesn't know what the tie stands for. Penny is happy that Leonard is \"getting busy\" when she hears Leslie exclaiming that Leonard is a beast.. She also gives the couple their privacy and moves away from Leonard's door.Sheldon is not sure what social protocol to follow with Leonard and Leslie when they come out of their \"session\".. The next morning, while Sheldon is sleeping, Leslie corrects Sheldon's work on his board.. This makes Sheldon livid as he does not consider Leslie to be his intellectual equal, although Leonard repeatedly points out that Leslie's correction removes the issues Sheldon was having with his equationsPenny later congratulates Leonard, who again tries to figure out what she meant. He is again unsure if Penny is jealous of him and Leslie or if she is genuinely happy that he is in a relationship.\nLeonard decides to pursue a real relationship with Leslie rather than an imaginary one with Penny, but at her lab, Leslie makes it clear she is not interested in a relationship: she just needed him for a one-night stand to satisfy her sex drive - which is now satisfied until New Year. Leonard tries to make plans with Leslie for New Years, but she pushes him back saying that he is smothering him and that she needs her space\nLeonard later tells Penny, who reassures him that everything is good between them and walks away smiling.Title reference: Sheldon switching his favorite burger restaurant.", "episode_6": "Penny invites the guys to her Halloween party.\nThey at first decline as they do not dance, but accept when costumes are mentioned.

Raj suggests that they could stand one behind the other and seem like one flash going really fast, but Howard nicks the idea saying that he needs to go solo to impress a girl.. Leonard calls dibs on Frodo..\nSo, the costumes are: Leonard as Frodo, Sheldon as the Doppler effect, Howard as Robin Hood (but everyone confuses him as Peter Pan) and Raj as Thor the Norse God (not the Marvel's character)At the party (the guys reach at 7:05 pm for a 7 pm party.. they are worried that they are late, only yo find that they are the first ones there and Penny herself is yet to take a bath and get ready for the party) they have problems socializing: Sheldon is unable to explain his Doppler effect costume since none of Penny's friends are physicists or smart enough to understand it; Raj (dressed as Thor) cannot speak to women; Howard as Robin Hood is mistaken for Peter Pan; and Leonard (dressed as Frodo Baggins from The Lord of the Rings) is insecure (he knows that this is the first time Penny is seeing him as part of her social peer group and he doesn't want to come across as a nerd).\nLeonard's middle name is Leaky (his dad worked with anthropologist Lewis Leaky decades ago).Penny's ex-boyfriend Kurt (underdressed as a very tall, muscular caveman) later shows up and aggressively confronts Leonard. Leonard decides to stand up to Kurt feeling confident that he can outsmart Kurt with his intellect. This goes to plan as Kurt has no understanding of the smart repartee that Leonards gives to Kurt's insults.\nBut then Kurt gets physical and literally picks up Leonard and is about to hang him on a door nail, when Penny intervenes and gets him to drop Leonard. This causes Leonard (and later Penny) to leave. Penny goes to check on Leonard and apologizes for Kurt's behavior.Sheldon serves Leonard a hot beverage as he is upset.\nPenny is very upset, but Leonard tells her she is perfect, and they kiss, though Penny confesses she is drunk and Leonard doesn't want to take advantage of her. They kiss again, in sight of Kurt, Leonard saying \"That's how we roll at the Shire!\" before locking his apartment door in panic.Meanwhile, Howard cannot find Raj, who is at home sleeping with a girl who finds him to be a \"very good listener\".

She responds by blowing up Sheldon's game character multiple times during the game, causing Sheldon to quit the game commenting that \"nobody can be that attractive and talented at video games at the same time\"To avoid the noisy \"lovers\", Penny sleeps on Leonard and Sheldon's couch that night (after Sheldon explains his morning bathroom schedule and tells Penny which way to sleep on the couch - feet pointing towards the door). As Penny retires for the night, the camera pans to Raj, whom everyone had forgotten and who slowly and quietly exits the apartment\nNext day Sheldon complains to Leonard about missing Dr Who on TV at 6:15 am on a Saturday since Penny is sleeping on the couch.

Howard cashes his Bar Mitzvah bonds to buy her stuff).Distraught at the odd number in the group (they need pairs of players to play Halo 3), Sheldon invites Penny to play Halo again, but she prefers to go dancing with her friends insteadThe guys believe their group is falling apart and go to speak to Howard. There they hear Howard's mother (Carol Ann Susi) arguing loudly with Christy (Howard's mother calls Christy a Gold Digger, but Christy is not willing to back down either), causing her to leave.\nHoward, single again, goes to play Halo with the guys, and the group is restored, completely ignoring Penny and her three attractive dancing friends who briefly appear at the door and offer to have sex with them. Penny uses this experiment to demonstrate to her friends that the guys are big nerds who would rather prefer video gaming over a group of sexy females throwing themselves at them for sex..Title reference: The scene where Leonard, Sheldon, and Raj are at the Chinese restaurant and do not know what to do with the spare dumpling which Howard would normally have eaten.

Also Raj thinks that Lalita is a fat woman, since she used to be very chubby as a child, when they played together back in India.\nSheldon advises Raj to marry the girl his parents have arranged, since marrying for love is a relatively recent phenomenon even in Western civilizations, while arranged marriages have been the bedrock of Indian culture for thousands of years.. Raj is angry at Sheldon for lecturing him on his own culture.To Raj's annoyance, Howard, uses a fake Indian accent to impersonate Raj, phones Lalita to set up a date for them.

On his date, Raj becomes an obnoxious drunk (He talks about how dentists as a profession is most prune to suicides). He also comments on how Lalita used to be fat.. Lalita is forced to put up with the encounter as even her parents wanted her to meet Raj as a prospective marriage match\nSheldon finds this objectionable and he flatters Lalita with compliments comparing her to Princess Panchali, an Indian fairy tale princess (with eyes fashioned from the stars and ruby lips in front of which the roses refused to bloom). Lalita is impressed with the nice way Sheldon treats her and is anyways not having a good time with Raj. Lalita takes Sheldon away for a meal, to Raj's horror.When Raj tries to explain all this to his parents, they are angry about his drinking.

Ted misses the Nassau County pageant (they are the judges, and their votes are for sale), finish line of the women's 10K (sweaty girls on an endorphin high), female acrobats from Montreal (super flexible)After the break-up, Robin (Cobie Smulders) went to Argentina while Ted grew a beard and painted the apartment. When Robin returns with her new boyfriend Gael (Enrique Iglesias), Ted announces he's finally ready. Gael is a joyful person and his life philosophy of bringing joy to others is a natural woman magnet. He is a masseuse to top it off and with an exotic accent.Ted decides that Robin is trying to win their break-up. Marshall backs up this theory by explaining to Lily about the winner and loser in each break-up, so Barney takes Ted out to help him win by getting Ted a 12 (given that Robin is a 10) but Ted gets a 12 on his own, a tattooed girl called Amy (Mandy Moore).After Gael had mentioned his passion for windsurfing and making love \"sometimes at the same time\", Barney insists this isn't possible as he has a list of 33 vehicles (land-based, aquatic and airborne) in/on which it is possible to have sex and a windsurfing board is not on the list. He claims to have had sex on 31 of the 33 vehicles and would only need a bobsled and the Apollo 11 space capsule to complete the list. Lily says that to get the last one he will need to break into the Smithsonian.Meanwhile, Lily and Marshall are having a night in with Robin and Gael after Lily inadvertently asked Gael out on a double date. Lily has a huge crush on Gael. Lily and Marshall are supposed to be supporting Ted by hating Gael, but both end up falling for Gael as he plays the acoustic guitar, gives massages and sensually feeds fruit to everyone else.On the night out with Ted, Barney clashes with Amy about everything (he didn't get to assist Ted in getting Amy, so he wants try somewhere else) and insists that he should be helping Ted as he is his wing-man but Ted is solely interested in Amy. Barney gives in to one request from Amy, for everyone to go back to her place, when she mentions that she has a hot tub. It turns out, the hot tub isn't Amy's, but belongs to a family who she used to nanny for and who are supposed to be in the Hamptons. Ted decides to get a tattoo himself to symbolize that he is winning the break-up but blacks out shortly after, while Barney leaves with a friend of Amy's to have sex.The following morning Ted claims he had a good time the night before and is relieved that he did not get a tattoo. Lily and Marshall spot a butterfly tattoo on Ted's lower back and call Barney to come and see. After cluing Ted into his new stamp, the night's proceedings come back to Ted but he gets distracted by finding a bottle of Spanish massage oils, and asks Lily and Marshall about it.Lily and Marshall explain what happened in the apartment the night before, which annoys Ted who goes to see Robin and accuses her of being over their break-up too fast. She says she cried for three days at the start of her holiday about missing Ted, which led her to Gael. Ted is still upset that Gael is so attractive, calling him an Adonis and the Cadillac of rebound guys, but Robin cheers him up by explaining that Ted is \"bigger\" than Gael, which leads Ted to tell the guys at the bar that he has won the break-up. Future Ted says the turn of events led to something good coming his way - someone passes by MacLaren's carrying a yellow umbrella.At the epilogue, Barney is called up in his office by Marshall, who is back in the apartment with the lights turned off. He asks him to open a website, slap-countdown.com. As Marshall suddenly hangs up, Barney is left screaming \"Noooooooo!\" upon seeing the countdown clock at roughly 55 days left to the Slapsgiving slap.", "episode_12": "Ted, Marshall and Lily decide to spend Saint Patrick's Day holding a board game night at Marshall and Lily's new apartment, rather than drinking green beer with a green-suited Barney. Barney, although insulted, accepts his fate and leaves alone. Soon after, Barney calls Ted, having procured a cab and two hot dates (Mary (Arielle Vandenberg) & Stephanie (Mieko Hillman)) for the night. He proposes his theory of \"No Tomorrow\" and that \"today\" will have no consequences, and finally convinces Ted to join him by promising him one of his dates. Ted agrees since Marshall and Lily are smelling each other's hands and Ted knows it will be a long night with them. Future Ted reveals that the Mother was present at the party that he and Barney attended that night.Back at board game night, Marshall and Robin discover that Marshall and Lily's new apartment is crooked. Marshall convinces Robin to keep it a secret from Lily, at least for the time being. However, when a painting on the wall suddenly moves, Lily senses something weird. To cover the truth, Marshall concocts a story about the ghost of a Confederate general haunting the apartment. Eventually, the secret comes out and Marshall, Lily and Robin end up inventing a game called \"apartment roller luge\" as a means of getting over the crooked floor.Meanwhile, out with Barney, Ted discovers that, for one night only, the universe seems to work in reverse and rewards him for every bad deed he does. He ditched Marshall and Lily and found himself with a hot date, then he and Barney ditched their dates in line outside a club (The club was full of nothing but girls and the bouncer was more than happy to let 2 guys in), and inside they found themselves outnumbered by hotter or equally hot women. He puts two expensive bottles of champagne on someone else's tab (named Garrido), and is presented with free caviar. The biggest reward comes when he gets hit on by a sure thing named Ashlee (Vanessa Minnillo). To test his theory he asks Ashlee if she would have a one-night stand with him and then forget about it entirely the next morning, to which she agrees, thus confirming his theory.\nThen, Ashlee confides in him that she is married, which fills him with panic and guilt. Barney approves of Ted's actions (Its not cheating if you are not the one who is married, It's not cheating if her name has 2 adjacent vowels in it, Its not cheating if she is from a different area code)but disapproves of his reluctance to proceed. Back with Ashlee, Ted hesitates and then gets punched out by the man whose tab he had used.Ted wakes up at home the next morning with a black eye and fond memories, telling Marshall that after police arrested the man he got to drink for free for the rest of the night. However Marshall is far from impressed and reminds Ted that he committed Credit Card fraud and kissed a married woman. To further the point, he reveals that Ted had accidentally pocket dialed his phone the whole time. Seventeen voice messages are played and remind Ted of how he abandoned his date at the door, ordered champagne on another person's bar tab and wanted to sleep with a woman with no intention of seeing her again (all while extremely drunk). Ashamed of his behavior, Ted thanks Marshall for confronting him with the hard truth.Ted tells Marshall that fixing a crooked floor will be very expensive and will take a lot of time. Marshall and Lily won't be moving out anytime soon.\nTed returns to the club to retrieve his phone, which he had left behind. He doesn't find it, but he grabs an abandoned yellow umbrella and walks home in the rain. Future Ted reveals that his eventual wife had been at the club that night, but they did not meet and he's glad because he knows that if they had, she would not have liked him.In the last scene, Barney wakes up next to a dumpster, proclaims, \"I'm awesome\" and stumbles away.", "episode_18": "Ted decides that it is time for his relationship with Stella (Sarah Chalke) to take the next step (they have been dating for 2 months and they haven't had sex yet.. Ted has been dry for over 5 months now). Stella is strangely reluctant, however, and she tells Ted a secret: she has not had sex for five years. Ted shares this with Marshall and Lily, as he does everything.Lily says her longest dry streak was the summer when she was in SFO, 2 months and 19 days away from Marshall. An earthquake hit SFO and vibrated Lily enough so that she had an orgasm. Marshall tells Ted to lower Stella's expectations in the build up to the big day. Ted brings potato skins to Stella at lunch and says that he hasn't had skins in while and remembers them to be the tastiest treat ever. Ted then remarks that the potato skin, while good, is not nearly as good as the ridiculous expectation he had built up for it in his head. Stella sees right through it.When Stella comes over on the night that she was meant to have sex with Ted (Her sister was driving in to baby sit Lucy (her daughter) and Ted had booked a hotel room for the night), they accidentally reveal that they know her secret. Stella is upset that Ted betrayed her trust and breaks up with him.Robin is perplexed that Ted is mad at Barney, but not with her. Ted says that he has forgiven Robin and outgrown Barney as a friend. Ted has moved on.Meanwhile, Barney tries to find a \"Rebound Bro\" to whom he can be a wing-man to help him get women. He misses Ted and, unwilling to admit it, puts applications up on his blog. Receiving few responses except for an enthusiastic proposal from his colleague Randy (Will Forte) (Barney says that the job is the Vice President of awesome and calls Randy the Assistant Undersecretary of only OK), Barney resorts to calling up old friends and previous wing-men.\nAfter many unsuccessful attempts (one already has a wing-man, one is married and has settled down, one has had a daughter just that very day) he decides to be the \"Bro\" to Randy and give him a chance. Unfortunately, he discovers that Randy hasn't had sex in thirteen years and Barney is repeatedly unsuccessful at getting him together with a woman, since Randy is uncomfortable with talking to women, and gets nosebleeds whenever he gets an erection.Barney is unsuccessful (he even teaches 3 ways to converse with women: Isolate her from her friends, repeat her name in conversation, subtly put her down) (Randy still doesn't learn and tells a Koala loving animal enthusiast that Koala meat is delicious) until he enlists Robin's help to make Randy comfortable with small-talk with women, telling Robin that he may have a sex tape with her to convince her to come and help Randy. Barney discovers that Randy was a police officer, albeit one that was fired for incompetence; nevertheless, Barney knows being in the 'force' impresses women, and quickly finds a woman who takes Randy home with her. Barney seems happy until Robin comments that \"Ted doesn't know what he's missing\". Barney tearfully remarks, \"You had to mention Ted, didn't you?\"Stella comes to Ted's house and admits that she broke up with him because she was afraid it was getting too serious and she was looking for a reason not to get too close to him. Ted and Stella's relationship goes even further than expected as Ted meets Stella's daughter and gets to know her. Later, Stella tells Ted that her sister (who was previously meant to take care of Stella's daughter while Stella and Ted had sex) is still in town and can take care of Stella's daughter. Stella and Ted rush to a motel, where they finally consummate their relationship.\nWhen Ted jokingly picks up the phone to tell Marshall and Lily about it after the deed is done, Stella pushes him off the bed in an equally lighthearted manner.", "episode_6": "Ted works at home, when Barney and Marshall come with great news. Barney has found a porn video starring another Ted Mosby, his \"doppelbanger.\" Marshall has gotten the job at the NRDC (National Resources Defense Council), a company that defends America's nature (It is Marshall's dream job). The next day, Marshall has an interview with a company Nicholson, Hewitt & West that does the complete opposite (and represented everyone that Marshall was going to sue after he started working at the NRDC). At first he thinks about not going, but his father has put a lot of effort in that interview, so he decides to go.At the bar, Lily, Ted, Barney and Robin discuss the porn star Ted Mosby. It turns out Ted has given an interview about his \"latest project\" to a porn magazine, thinking it was Architecture Weekly (The interview was over the phone with someone from AVW (Adult Video Weekly), while Ted thought it was the Architecture Vision Weekly.. Its a team project, I know the guys are going to ride me pretty hard, but they are great guys). The porn Mosby has done 125 movies in 3 months.\nMarshall then walks in. His interview with the company's boss Jeff Coatsworth (John Cho) didn't turn out how he expected it to go (Jeff is young and nice & cool). He planned to tear into the company because he wouldn't take the job anyway. Jeff then seduced Marshall to go to dinner with him (he got Ted a drink, and pretended to care about whatever idiotic thing Ted cared about). Jeff takes Marshall to have Kobe lobster, which is lobster fed with Kobe beef (the most expensive beef in the world)\nRobin finds out that Ted Mosby the porn star shares the hometown with Ted, and Ted decides to see the porn-star Ted at his autograph signing appearance at the Adult Video Expo, the following night.At dinner, Marshall gets impressed by Jeff's offer (its a big number, with signing bonus, use of a company car, and expense account). Jeff says that the only reason Ted wont take the offer is because he has family money or if he doesn't plan to have any kids.\nMarshall then struggles with taking the offer or not. He makes up a pro-con list. The pro side reads Money, Security and Swayze, whereas the con side reads only Evil. Robin and Lily sit in the apartment, and Robin asks how Lily can afford all her expensive clothes. After a few lies (she shops the sales, they were in the closet when they moved in, she steals), Lily shows Robin her credit cards. It turns out she has a big debt.Barney and Ted go to the autograph signing, and Barney tells him that porn will stand the test of time like Shakespeare. Lily explains that she buys something whenever she is feeling bad. Lily tells Robin that Marshall doesn't know anything about this. Robin convinces Lily to tell Marshall to take the high-paying job.Ted and Barney talk to Ted Mosby the porn star. He then explains his real name is Steve Biel, and when he was in 4th grade, Ted was in 9th. When a bunch of 7th graders were beating up Steve, Ted saved him, and Steve vowed that he would honor Ted in some way. Ted tells him he wants to have a career as an architect. Steve asks him if he's a sex architect and they agree that would be a great porn movie title. Ted lies that he didn't save him, but a so called \"Lance Hardwood\" did.Marshall crashed at Jeff's couch, and walked along to the Sunday morning's \"Walk of Shame.\" When he gets home, he tells Lily he took the job. Lily asks how much money it makes. She sees the amount and imagines herself swimming in boots. At MacLaren's the men discuss why Marshall should or shouldn't take the job. Lily convinces Marshall to take the job at the NRDC, because that's what he wants. She says she'll figure out a way to solve her problem on her own.When Marshall calls Jeff to decline the job offer, Jeff comes along in a limousine and takes him to Tuckahoe Funland. There, he tells Jeff he will not take the job. Jeff, smooth talker that he is, convinces Marshall to take the job, saying that his only client will be Tuckahoe Funland, the least evil place in the world, where dreams are madeAt the apartment, the group watches \"Lance Hardwood, sex architect, starring Ted Mosby.\" Barney says he's on the credit list as location scout. It turns out the movie was shot in the apartment.", "episode_5": "At the bar Ted introduces the gang to his newest girlfriend, whose name Future Ted can't remember and instead refers to as \"Blah Blah\" (Abigail Spencer). Embarrassed that she and Ted met online, she makes up a story about how she saw Ted across a crowded room at a cooking class.\nBarney theorizes that since BlahBlah is hot, she must also be crazy, as per the hot/crazy scale. A girl is allowed to be crazy, if she is equally hot. You want the girl to be above the Hot/Crazy line, also known as the Vickie Mendoza diagonal.\nIt soon becomes clear that she is extremely neurotic and paranoid when she feels threatened by Robin. In order to change the subject, everyone begins to reminisce about how they all met each other, and their stories are told through flashbacks.How Marshall met Lily - Marshall and Lily first met in 1996 when Lily needed help with her stereo and she had a strange feeling about room Hewitt 110. Knocking on the door, Marshall answered and it was clearly love at first sight.\nBlahblah suggests that Robin and Barney are together, eliciting 16 no's from Robin.How Ted met Marshall - Ted and Marshall first met when they became college roommates. Marshall was \"eating a sandwich\" when he was told that the Dean was coming. When Ted arrived, Marshall attempted to conceal the \"sandwich\" and became upset that Ted (believing him to be the Dean) would be his roommate. The confusion was cleared up when Marshall walked in on Ted eating a sandwich of his own.\nBlahBlah feels that Robin was teasing her for never going to college and retorts that she was supporting her family and has a line of handbags coming out. Robin says there is nothing going on between her and Ted, which surprises Blahblah.How Ted met Barney - Ted and Barney met in the men's room of MacLaren's in 2001, after which Barney made Ted his new wing-man and told a girl Audrey (Betsy Rue) that Ted is deaf so that Barney can get the girl's phone number. When the girl mentioned she knew sign language, Ted signed to her that Barney was a great guy and recommended she give him her number. After telling the story, Barney comments that he knew from that moment that he and Ted would be wing-men forever, even though the girl gave him a fake number. Ted reveals that he actually instructed the girl in sign language to give Barney a fake number, which upsets Barney.\nHe reveals to BlahBlah that Ted and Robin dated for a while.How Ted met Robin - Ted provides a condensed version of how he first spotted Robin across the bar in 2005, and the two instantly felt a connection.Throughout the stories, Blah Blah becomes increasingly paranoid rather than mollified, particularly when she learns that the gang already knows that she and Ted actually met online and after hearing the story of how Ted and Robin met and dated for a while. When she wishes that she and Ted had a wonderful first meeting story like Lily and Marshall, Ted reluctantly counters that the story isn't as great as it sounds and tells the story of how he met Lily.How Ted met Lily - During a freshman party at college, Ted and Lily met as Marshall chugged from a keg. He flirted with Lily and suggested that she come to his room, after which they began making out.Ted explains that Lily had come to his and Marshall's room the next day and he and Lily have never spoken about their first meeting since. Blah Blah, keen to make Ted uncomfortable, vindictively orders Ted to confess to Marshall or she will. Returning to the table, Blah Blah asks Lily how she met Ted. However, Lily recounts the event differently.How Lily met Ted - When Lily went to Marshall and Ted's room, Ted had been on the phone desperately apologizing to his long distance girlfriend Karen (Laura Prepon) for making out with another girl. After Marshall introduced her to Ted, Ted quickly rushed off upon seeing her to try sending Karen an email.When Blah Blah presses for details, Ted takes Lily aside to discuss what happened at the party. Though Lily recalls kissing someone at the party, she can't remember who the guy was (Too much tongue guy) while Ted insists the guy was him (with unreasonably small mouth opening girl). Meanwhile, Marshall and Barney talk about how they met.How Barney met Marshall - In 2001, Barney had attempted to persuade Marshall to forget his girlfriend and score with a random girl at MacLaren's. Marshall initially refused, but decided to play along when Barney unwittingly selected Lily as Marshall's target. Marshall had walked up to her and kissed her, which immediately impressed Barney until he learned that Lily was Marshall's girlfriend.Unimpressed, Blah Blah tells Marshall that Ted and Lily kissed. Marshall doesn't believe the story, because he remembers that Ted and Lily had kissed two other people, not each other, at the freshman party, which Lily easily accepts. A furious Blah Blah storms out, but not before revealing that she met Ted playing World of Warcraft.For the sake of Marshall and Lily's relationship, Ted accepts Marshall's story, though he is secretly unconvinced. At their college reunion in 2020, Ted is approached by a woman, Alexa Leskeys (Jolie Jenkins) who tells him that she was the one he made out with at the freshman party, proving Marshall was correct. Later Ted, Marshall and Lily all sit down for a \"sandwich\" that Marshall confiscated and get high when Ted suddenly realizes he can't find his wife.", "episode_10": "The gang decides to get in shape (after Ted huffs and puffs running to his room to get cash for the pizza delivery guy) and everyone joins a gym. Barney has a gym where he invests in fat women, who will become hot after working out for a few months or years. This way, when they are hot, Barney is the first guy they turn to.\nBarney is shocked to see that the woman working at the gym's smoothie bar is Rhonda (Stephanie Faracy), the woman to whom he lost his virginity. He has a flashback to when, fresh from his break-up with long-time girlfriend Shannon (Katie Walder), his brother James (Wayne Brady) (who was \"not gay yet\") set him up with his mother's friend, Rhonda \"The Manmaker\" French (who had already had sex with the paper boy, the pool guy and the guy who delivers Chinese food), who told Barney that he \"rocked her world\", boosting his confidence. That was the night the myth and the legend of Barney was born. All the subsequent women he satisfied came from the confidence he gained from satisfying Rhonda.Later, Rhonda tells Barney that James convinced her to tell him that he was her best ever, and Rhonda says she only agreed to it because James slept with her (at the time James was still not out of the closet yet) - Rhonda doesn't even remember Barney's name (she calls him Barry).Barney decides to get over it by going to the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show after-party with Ted and Marshall, where all of Barney's pick-up lines become vulgar (I am going to get in your panties, incorporated. Legend .. wait for it .. how long do we have to wait for it?.. Those are very nice honkers) and fall flat. Barney realizes he has the yips-he is over-thinking hitting on girls to the point where he can't do it anymore. Heidi Klum (who says Barney has the \"Ach du meine G\u00fcte, nichts klappt mehr, \u00fcberhaupt gar nichts mehr, so 'ne Schei\u00dfe!\") convinces him to go back to Rhonda and try again to regain his confidence.She rejects him at first (he loses all hope and even gives up wearing his suits), but after Barney talks to her at the bar (Rhonda comes to the bar as Ted told her at the gym that Barney was having a tough time), she invites him over to play cards (she says sleeping with her is not going to solve anything), which quickly turns into sex. Rhonda insists that it really WAS the best she ever had this time, while Barney agrees in monotone, clearly having gained his confidence back. Daddy's backMarshall is having a much harder time at the gym than anticipated. Although his trainer Trish (Meredith Roberts Quill) is a cute girl, she drives him very hard, making him do hundreds of push-ups & sit-ups and making him cry with only her words. Marshall is miserable with the trainer as she continues to push him way beyond his limits and everything in his body hurts. He is even too afraid to call her and tell her that he quits.\nLily calls Trish on Marshall's behalf and tries to fire her, but she ends up only being even more pissed.\nLily gets a very muscular trainer who is helping her with flexibility, but it turns out, is completely unaffiliated with the gym.\nRobin enjoys the gym because she doesn't have to wear a cute outfit and can work out uninhibitedly, although the gang makes fun of her for looking manly. Looking at Robin grunting and sweating, Ted manages to lose all romantic feelings for her.\nTed seems to always find a reason to avoid working out (e.g., bringing the wrong shorts, no charge in the iphone, getting a free massage), but after Marshall passes his trainer on to him, he gets what he paid for. Ted ends up crying, miserable and sweaty, and this time Robin manages to lose all romantic feelings for him.\nAlthough everyone agrees joining the gym was a great decision, Older Ted's voice-over reveals that, after that first week, they never went back.", "episode_20": "The episode begins with Ted waiting for a cab. He bends down to tie his shoe and misses three cabs, but finally gets in one. Flashback to Ted coming home from brunch with Stella. He tells the gang that Stella invited Ted to her sister's wedding in 6 months. Ted reminds them of Barney's rule about planning ahead in relationships (you never make plans further in the future than the amount of time you have been going out). Ted has a little breakdown, and says 'We need to talk' to Stella. Stella is angry, and walks away claiming \"we are good\".We then go back to Ted sitting in the cab, and the cab is hit by a speeding car that drove through the intersection. A montage is seen of everyone being informed of Ted's accident, and they all rush to the hospital to see that Ted is fine. He reveals that he wants Stella back, and that the accident let him re-examine his relationship with her. Marshall declares it's a miracle, to which Robin scoffs. Marshall is puzzled at why she doesn't believe in miracles, and he flashes back to when he, Ted, and Barney are all sitting at a bar, throwing pencils in the ceiling. One falls down and bounces off the table and into Barney's right nostril and he survives. Marshall says that that was a miracle, and Robin's explanation is \"a drunk jackass with a box of pencils.\"Lily thinks she should call Barney to tell him about Ted, and Barney hangs up before she can tell him that Ted is fine. Barney leaves an important business meeting to get to Ted, and he misses a cab and has to run all the way to the hospital. Ted then says that when he was in the car crash, instead of his whole life flashing before his eyes, he just saw the things he loves, and that's why he wants Stella back.\nMarshall exclaims \"Miracle!\", and again Robin disagrees. Marshall flashes back to when he was returning to the United States from Amsterdam, and is carrying a backpack full of illegal drugs, and has to give it to the customs officer, when all the sudden the officer's shift ends, and the new customs officer lets him through. Marshall yells \"Miracle!\" again. Now it flashes to Barney, who is still running full speed to get to Ted. Stella comes to the hospital to see Ted, and she tells him their breakup is \"forgotten\" and she kisses him on the bed. Marshall says it's a miracle, and Robin is sarcastic about the miracle.Another flashback to a miracle, where Marshall is talking to Lily while she is teaching her kindergarten class. Marshall goofs off with the kids, and wears their tiny Pilgrim hats. When he is asking for his job back at Nicholson, Hewitt, and West, his former boss Joe Hewitt is going to hire Marshall back, when Marshall realizes he got lice from the children. He keeps scratching his head, and is clearly uncomfortable in his boss' office. He screams out, \"I HAVE LICE!\" and is kicked out of the office. Marshall says the lice made it so he couldn't get his job back, and it was a miracle because two weeks later, his boss was arrested.Lily tells Stella that she is glad to see them together again, and Stella realizes it was a breakup even though she thought it was just a small fight. She is upset at Ted, and she tells Ted that they are really broken up now. Immediately after that, the hospital calls Ted and tells him Barney has been in an accident. Barney was crossing the street to the get to the hospital when he is hit by a bus driving the wrong way down a one way street. Barney lives, but all the bones are broken in his body, except \"one bone downstairs.\" Ted gets very emotional about what Barney did for him, and they become friends again. Marshall says that there were \"two miracles in one day,\" and Robin again says that it isn't a miracle.Robin then reveals her reason for not believing in miracles: when she was a kid, her dog Sir Scratchewan was just about to die, and when her parents took him to the veterinarian, the vet said that he had learned of a new operation earlier that day that would save her dog's life. Marshall says that this is a miracle, but Robin reveals the one major side effect of this operation: her dog \"turned into\" a turtle.The orderly tells Ted he can leave, and he rushes out to meet Stella, who is at Kiddy Fun Land with Lucy. Marshall and Lily ask Barney about what he saw before he was hit by the bus. They joke about him seeing a giant boob wearing a suit of money that is lactating scotch, but while they are saying this, he's looking at Robin. Marshall says \"I guess that's pretty much all you love, right?\" and Barney says \"Yeah, pretty much.\"The scene then cuts to Ted talking to Stella at Kiddy Fun Land, and he gives her a small orange kangaroo stuffed animal. Ted tells her he's ready to give her what she needs, and that's why he spent ten minutes at the claw machine trying to get a fake diamond ring, but he could only get an orange kangaroo. Stella is confused why he would need a diamond ring, and Ted proposes to her.", "episode_4": "Lily tells Robin she will set her up on a date with a guy named George (Brad Rowe). After she lists his good qualities, Ted points out that she has not mentioned his flaw (or as the gang call it, his \"but...\") though when pushed, Lily reveals that George has a son in her kindergarten class. Despite Robin's personal dislike of children (even as a kid, she hated other kids), she goes on a date with George and ends up meeting his son, Doug (Nicholas Roget-King).\nRobin wants to know her \"but\", and her friends say there is nothing wrong with her, while secretly thinking, gun nut, afraid of commitment, Canadian, didn't like Field of Dreams.After some initial hesitancy and an argument about how cereal should be served, Robin and Doug actually hit it off. However, when Robin decides to break up with George before Doug becomes attached to her, Lily shows Robin a picture that Doug has drawn of his \"new mommy\" (Doug studies in Lily's class at school). Despite Robin claiming otherwise, everyone else believes the woman in the picture is Robin. Lily informs Robin that if she breaks up with George, she must break up with Doug as well - Robin reluctantly agrees.Meanwhile, Ted ridicules Barney's latest pick-up plan (A bunch of snakes got loose in Central Park. They were training for the Death Valley Iron Man. The snakes attack a little baby and the guys save the baby while strangling 6 cobras with their bare hands.. They got bit on the eye, hence the eye-patches) and the two argue about who has more \"game\", while, to his dismay, Marshall is classed as irrelevant (Marshall argues that if dating is the game, then marriage is winning the game). Marshall calculates that if he and Lily had sex twice a week, plus 17 times on their honeymoon, minus 2 weeks when he checked out a girl at the mall, they had sex 1053.5 times.. 0.5 is because, Marshall's mom called once in the middle. Ted counts it as 1.\nTo settle the argument, Ted and Barney select a girl from the bar to see who can sleep with her first. While Ted is distracted Barney makes his move, only to be slapped in the face. Barney explains this is because he had already slept with the girl the year before and therefore, has won the bet, but Ted rules otherwise and begins his pick-up attempt and succeeds.Ted and Stacey (Janet Varney), the girl from the bar, have begun dating so he gloats to Barney about winning the bet. However, Barney makes Ted uncomfortable with thoughts that Barney has already been with Stacey (He has had sex with her, motor-boated her and so on) and Ted breaks up with Stacey (since every time he tries to get intimate with her, he pictures Barney on her body), admitting to Barney and Marshall that he was unable to get past the thought of her and Barney together.Barney reveals that he had not slept with Stacey at all; on the night of the bet, he asked Stacey to slap him to make it appear as though she hated him to set up the entire ruse that they had slept together. As Ted gloated about his dates with Stacey, Barney learned various details about Stacey's life (she likes yoga, plays bass in a reggae band, says love cliches and so on) and befriends her, so that he could be there for her when she broke up with Ted. However, one month later, he finds himself bored and frustrated for agreeing to Stacey's request to take things slowly since her experience with Ted.Robin goes to see Doug and takes advantage of the fact that he has never been dumped before by using \"every cliche in the book\" (its not you its me, we can both use some space right now, we need to talk, I really need to focus on my career right now) but she is interrupted by the arrival of George's new girlfriend, Brooke (Deanna Russo), whom she realizes is actually the woman in Doug's drawing. Lily tries to comfort Robin after her breakup, but cannot believe she was dumped by a six-year-old. Robin claims she is done with kids but Future Ted narrates that she would eventually make her peace with kids and go on to appear in some important works of art - pictures drawn by his kids of themselves with \"Aunt Robin\".", "episode_2": "Lily & Marshall explain they are writing their 'death folders' containing useful information should either of them die and a letter to one another, but Marshall tells Ted and Barney that he forgot to write his letter. Ted and Barney play on Marshall's superstitious nature by insisting he will not die before writing it, forcing Marshall to knock on wood, throw salt over his left shoulder, and spin around three times, before leaving.Older Ted narrates that Robin needed time away following their break-up and we see her on vacation with Gael, saying she felt up-tight in New York. Back in the bar she claims to be a different person, but Barney says Robin is still the same, adding that she will realize this and dump Gael soon. When Gael joins them, the gang use big words in order to continue their conversation without letting on, which makes Gael ask if they are talking about baseball.Marshall writes his letter to Lily, pouring his heart (and tears) out over many pages. Once finished, he decides to read Lily's letter to him and is angry to discover it is not as heart-felt as his (it contains information on her teacher's pension and a reminder to cancel Vogue.)At the bar, Gael is surrounded by women while Ted and Barney lament how easy it is for Gael to get girls simply by being from out of town. This gives them the idea to pose as tourists outside MacLaren's and they strike up a conversation with two passing girls. The girls agree to show the guys around the following day and Barney suggests they meet up outside MacLaren's but the girls think it's a lame bar. Ted tries to defend his favorite watering hole, without revealing he is a New Yorker.Inside, Lily asks Robin how things are going with Gael and Robin reveals she has become annoyed doing things at home that she loved on holiday, such as being hand-fed her food by Gael (dropping spaghetti on her sofa) and him sweeping the table clear to make love (breaking her laptop). Robin says she won't complain and go with the flow but when she is in the shower later, someone uses her toilet and, initially thinking it is Gael, she is shocked to discover it is actually a strange Australian backpacker (Damon Gameau). Robin goes to speak to Gael but discovers he has invited the backpacker and his friends to stay with them.Marshall starts an argument with Lily over her loveless letter. They exchange a quick hug after Lily mentions this is their first fight as a married couple before Marshall continues to storm out.The girls (Colleen (Michele Nordin) and Lindsay (Nikki Griffin)) take Ted and Barney to a potato restaurant called taters. When the girls go to the bathroom, Ted says they have met the \"two lamest New Yorkers of all time\", but Barney convinces Ted to continue with the plan and the girls decide to take Ted and Barney to a friend's party.Robin reveals she ate a marijuana-laced Blueberry muffin one of the backpackers had baked, causing her to say some inappropriate things on the air. She tries to lay some ground-rules but the group is watching the television and so Robin decides to lie down as she is still \"pretty baked\".Ted, Barney, Colleen and Lindsay are in a cab on their way to the party. Ted questions where they are going and is terrified to learn they are heading for the South Bronx. His fears are confirmed as they end up giving descriptions to the police of three guys who have apparently mugged them.Marshall quizzes Lily over why she couldn't write a love letter like he did and Lily states it is because she cannot bear to think about not being with him, and that he would just open the letter and read it as soon as she has finished writing anyway. Marshall promises he won't, so Lily agrees to write her letter, but Marshall asks her to make the letter \"dirty\" and slip in some Polaroids.Back on the street, Ted and Barney are invited back to the girls' place but Ted finally snaps when he finds out the girls are actually from New Jersey. Ted chastises the girls about not being from New York and derides New Jersey. He tells them to go home, which they do getting a lift from the cops. Ted and Barney try to get the same courtesy but the police officer refuses by stating he is \"Newark, born and raised\".Robin is woken by the sound of bongo drums and confronts 'vacation Robin' in the living room who tells her that she has lost her way since coming home. Robin retorts by saying that her vacation self is boring, lame, and getting sand everywhere. As the two are about to kiss, Robin is really woken by drums and finds the group of travelers playing in the living room. She finally gets rid of them by brandishing her gun but the shouting wakes Gael and Robin tells him they have to break up. Barney toasts the return of the real Robin while she mentions that 'vacation Robin' popped up in her dreams again and that \"that chick knows what I like\".Lily finishes her letter and makes Marshall swear not to read it until she is dead. Older Ted narrates that he kept his promise until November 2029 when an older, balding Marshall opens the letter (implying that Lily has died) to find Lily's words telling him he is busted. Marshall calls Lily, older and very much alive, into his office and they argue. Marshall says Lily also broke her promise as there are no naked pictures in the envelope for him; Lily says she will take some photos but Marshall doesn't want ones of her at that age, which sparks an argument.", "episode_8": "Ted thinks that he has found the perfect girl, Cathy (Lindsay Price), but the group disagrees. At first they refuse to give a reason so as not to \"spoil\" her for him. Ted imagines that while he was gone, Cathy must have mentioned things like she kills unwanted puppies, or lied about having sex with her English teacher in 10th grade, or she was a dude earlier and had a penis. Ted cant see the problem, since he is trying to have sex with Cathy.\nEventually Marshall tells him that she talks too much. Now that Ted knows, he cannot stand her garrulousness. Just like that the illusion was shattered.\nMeanwhile, Marshall's bar exam results are due. The pressure of the exam is immense and many student crack, many during the exam itself. Months later, the results are now due to be posted online. 50% of the students fail the exam.\nThe five friends then let slip each other's flaws until all are \"spoiled\", and thus are more annoying to those who had previously not noticed the flaws:Lily: chewing loudly (pointed out by Ted to Marshall); Ted calls her Chewbacca.\nMarshall: singing about whatever he is doing at the moment, or nonsense (pointed out by Robin to Lily);\nTed: correcting people (pointed out by Lily to Robin);\nRobin: overusing and misusing the word \"literally\" (pointed out by Ted);\nBarney: speaking in a falsetto, using catch phrases, and spacing out when his friends are talking to him (pointed out by Marshall, Robin and Ted to Barney).Whenever one or more of the group has these quirks pointed out to them, the sound of glass shattering is heard. This represents the shattering of their illusions about one another.Meanwhile, Marshall's bar exam results have been released, but he cannot remember the password he needs to retrieve the results online (thus making him wait for three months for a notification by mail). Marshall's friends, including Brad, have passed the exam, but Marshall doesn't know his fate, making him nervous and anxious.Barney offers to help (He knows a guy who owns a software designed to penetrate firewalls and retrieve passwords) but is only a ruse (to make Marshall watch the video of a dog pooping on a baby), and, with Marshall angry at Barney and the whole gang annoyed with one another, the arguments reach a climax.\nThe argument is halted when the group mockingly sings one of Marshall's \"nonsense\" songs (Apple Orchard Banana Cat Dance 8 6 6 3); the song was actually a mnemonic device to help Marshall remember his password (aobcd8663 - it is not shown if it has upper or lower case letters) for the bar exam results website. He enters it and proudly announces \"I'm a lawyer\".The group then celebrates with champagne at MacLaren's with each sliding back into their bad habits (Lily crunching loudly on bar snacks, Ted making a correction on a comment, Robin using \"literally\" incorrectly, Barney saying \"Law-suit up!\" in a high-pitched voice, and Marshall singing his own praises) which they all let go.At the end, in a time leap three years forward, Ted runs into his overly loquacious ex-girlfriend with her deaf fiance Daniel (Stephen Lloyd), and uses sign language to announce how Cathy talks too much. Even though the man is deaf and it does not affect him, Ted has \"spoiled\" Cathy to Daniel, and a subtitle displays \"(Glass shattering)\" as Ted walks away and Daniel looks on in despair.", "episode_17": "Its Ted's 30th birthday.\nThe episode begins with the aftermath of the events of \"Sandcastles in the Sand\": Barney and Robin are in bed together after having sex and she proposes to pretend it never happened.Barney agrees but feels quite awkward and uncomfortable around Ted at MacLaren's later in the day. Every conversation at the table makes Barney feel that the gang is talking about him having had sex with Robin the night before. When Ted offers Barney his Xbox, Barney is offended and says that she has a name.\nMeanwhile Marshall has told Ted that the gang is planning a surprise birthday party for him. Ted asks Barney to invite Stella.Hoping to find an excuse for his and Robin's actions, Barney seeks out Marshall to help him (as a lawyer) find a loophole in the Bro Code, a book listing the rules and philosophies of Barney's life as a \"bro\".Allegedly written by Barnabas Stinson in the 18th century when Benjamin Franklin and George Washington were too busy to write it themselves (They wanted a set of rules to define acceptable behavior between friends when it came to girls), the Bro Code proves to be a very tight document (Bros before hos, The mom of a bro is off limits but the step mom is fair game if she initiates it or is wearing at least one article of leopard print clothing, Bros cannot make eye contact during a devil's three way (2 dudes)) that Ted has followed flawlessly (a bro at all times shall say yes (Ted said yes when Barney claims to a girl that he saved him from an avalanche, carried him 6 miles to safety on a broken leg), a bro will in a timely manner alert in case of a girl-fight, A bro will whenever possible provide his bro with protection) and Barney fails in finding a loophole.\nThe bro code clearly states no sex with a bro's ex. Marshall says Barney feels bad as he knows what he did was wrong. He tells Barney to come clean to Ted.When Marshall's nervous behavior reveals to Robin that Barney told him, she tells him that Ted is never finding out. That night, when Barney picks up Ted in a limo (to take him to a surprise birthday party that Lily has arranged for him on the apartment roof), he attempts to give Ted an ultimate 30th birthday by flying him to Vegas, which includes staying at the Bellagio, steaks at Boa, and a boxing match between Floyd Mayweather and a grizzly bear.\nTed reveals that he knows Barney and Robin slept together, for Robin told him right after she warned Marshall. Ted, at first, seems calm, and Barney is relieved, but Ted screams at him, angrily declares they're no longer friends (after Ted hits Barney in the private parts when Barney offers him one free shot anywhere on his body but the face) (Ted says that he had seen Barney do a lot of bad stuff to many people, but he always felt Ted was the limit and that Barney would never betray him), and hails a cab to take him home to his friends. Barney then sadly sits in the limo alone all night.Meanwhile, Lily rescues a goat named Missy when a farmer (Farmer Frank, (Alan Fudge)) brings it to her kindergarten class and horrifies her students by going into great detail about what will happen to Missy when she visits the butcher. Lily plans to give the goat away to animal control (who will only come to the apartment after the weekend on Monday), but becomes attached to the goat while waiting for Ted to arrive at his birthday party.\nOlder Ted reveals at the end of the episode, after hinting at the destruction the goat would do, that he had the story wrong: Everything involving the goat actually takes place during his 31st birthday, at which point - Older Ted also reveals - Robin is living in the apartment.", "episode_9": "The episode begins with Future Ted telling his kids about a private joke he and Robin used to share while they were going out where they would salute whenever another person used a word that sounded like a military rank before another word in a sentence (an example being 'Kernel (Colonel) Stuck In My Teeth'), but since breaking up they simply share awkward looks whenever someone does it. Future Ted also explains that they can no longer spend time alone together.It is going to be the gang's first Thanksgiving with Marshall and Lily as a married couple. Lily is obsessing over making sure it is perfect, Robin has invited her older boyfriend Bob (Orson Bean), who Ted perceives to be ancient, to Thanksgiving dinner. Bob is 41 yrs old and does snowboarding as a career.\nMarshall is terrorizing Barney in the days leading up to Barney's third slap (by calling it Slapsgiving), and has even set up a countdown on his computer.\nWhen Robin and Ted are the only two members of the group to show up to a night of baking pies (Lily was swamped preparing for Thanksgiving the next day, and Marshall was not helping around the house at all), they notice that they have nothing to talk about when they are together, creating a nagging feeling that they are no longer really friends. Ted tries to get Barney to come, but he was busy hitting on girls at the bar.When Ted and Robin arrive at Marshall and Lily's apartment for Thanksgiving, Lily is floundering to get the apartment ready for their dinner. Ted and Robin reveal separately (to Marshall and Lily respectively) that they fought while baking, and ended the night by having sex. They narrate that Robin tried to break the ice with cool pie and Egypt facts, but Ted made it ten times worse by referring to how they had sex 7 times on one of the Thanksgivings. Then Robin talks about baking pecan pies for Bob, while hiding it for me, making Ted realize that Robin feels that Ted is jealous of Bob. They fight on this topic. Ted says Bob discovered fire, rode shotgun on the ark and was there at the first thanksgiving. Robin objects to the parade of dubious random women that Ted has been putting in front of her these past few months. They end up hugging and having sex.Robin and Lily decide that Robin and Ted need to talk about what happened and Ted, Marshall and Barney have decided they must ignore it. Robin and Ted argue again (about who started it) and Lily forces them to talk it out. After the two discuss how weird it is to be around each other they come to the realization that they're not friends, and agree that after the dinner they shouldn't see each other again.\nMeanwhile, Barney begins to get upset at the notion of another slap. He begs Marshall not to slap him again. Barney wants to leave the house, as nowhere in the rules does it say that he needs to sit through this kind of torture. Following Marshall's relentless taunting of Barney and lack of interest in helping her prepare, Lily declares as Slap Bet Commissioner that no slap would occur on Thanksgiving much to Barney's delight and Marshall's dismay.In Ted's room, they decide to call it quits after Thanksgiving dinner. They decide not to be friends anymore\nEverybody sits down for Thanksgiving dinner, and Lily is upset that nobody is taking it very seriously. Robin and Ted exchange sad glances with each other. Marshall speaks and thanks Lily for her hard work in putting together the Thanksgiving. Later, over the dinner Bob uses the phrase 'major buzzkill', causing Ted and Robin to salute without thinking, making them realize there's still a connection between them and they can still be friends.\nFuture Ted tells his kids that he had a great evening with his friends (and Bob), and that's why he takes them to Marshall and Lily's to spend Thanksgiving every year. Barney begins to taunt dismayed Marshall as the countdown enters the last ten seconds. Lily warns him not to but when Barney keeps going regardless, she allows the slap to happen with only three seconds to go. Overjoyed, Marshall slaps Barney immediately, sending him flying across the room before singing \"You Just Got Slapped\" (a song of his own creation) with everybody.In the kitchen after dinner, Ted notes there's going to be a 'major clean-up' making everyone unknowingly salute and despair. Marshall asks if this is going to be a regular thing from now on and Robin replies, \"That's the general idea,\" causing another salute.", "episode_3": "Ted calls Barney from the bathroom in MacLaren's to explain that he is about to \"go for the belt\", which Barney cannot believe. Half an hour previously we see Barney and Marshall playing tennis on the Nintendo Wii and Ted, 'suited up' and about to leave, tries to get them to come with him. Barney says Ted takes too long to get ready. Ted is happy with his \"just rolled out of bed\" look, which Marshall says takes an hour and a half to get right. Engrossed in their game, Barney and Marshall say they will follow shortly.Robin and Lily are also dressed up; Lily explains she got the boots Robin is wearing in a shoe sale \"footwear feeding frenzy\", but after asking if the boots are a bit high for her dress, Robin explains her new 'no shave' policy for the first 3 dates (if I don't shave, I must behave), which Barney ridicules. Ted calls Barney from the bar, but the guys can't make it down due to their tennis tournament. Ted then runs into Trudy (Danica McKellar) from \"The Pineapple Incident\" and, while chatting, Trudy's competitive sorority sister Rachel (Busy Philipps) appears and joins in.Ted calls Barney again to explain the situation that's arising and to ask which girl he should go for. Lily takes Barney's phone and tells Ted she will come down to see and let him know, but when she arrives she says that both are giving him the green light. Meanwhile, Robin is on a date with a British surgeon and flirting to comical proportions, but then she calls Lily and tells her to bring a razor, as she is about to break her 'no shave' policy.Rachel and Trudy insinuate to Ted about their plans for a threesome (or as Ted puts it, \"tricycle\") and Ted explains to Lily and Marshall about the ongoing competition between himself and Barney for 'the belt', a replica wrestling belt that Barney bought some time ago, which would be awarded to the first one to pull off 'the tricycle'. Marshall is upset he wasn't included in the tricycle competition and tries to convince everyone he could win. Barney asks Ted if the aggregate age of all participants is under 83 and the aggregate weight is under 400 pounds, none of the women are being paid.\nRachel, Trudy and Ted decide to head up to the apartment.Robin calls Lily again to ask for a razor but Lily cannot leave the apartment due to Ted's situation, and so Robin is forced to pay $50 to a waitress at the restaurant to get her a razor from a nearby pharmacy.Ted tells Barney, Lily & Marshall that he is bringing the girls upstairs, so they hide in Ted's room. Ted goes to hang up the girls' coats but runs into the rest of the gang in his room, where Barney attempts to sabotage Ted's plans and insists that the belt is his birth-right. Barney tells the story of how he almost \"rode the tricycle\" the year before, but a spilled glass of red wine scuppered his chances. As Ted protests about Barney's interference, Lily takes a closer look at the girls and recognizes Rachel from the earlier shoe sale incident as the girl who snatched a pair of boots from Lily's grasp.On Robin's date, the waitress gives Robin a razor but without any shaving cream, and so she is forced to improvise in the bathroom with some butter she took from a customer's table. She slips and knocks herself out on the bathroom floor, leaving her date waiting outside.As Rachel and Trudy attempt to step things up with Ted, he suffers an attack of nerves and tries to end things abruptly. When he confronts the gang in his bedroom, Barney defends Ted's actions by explaining that this problem is not uncommon and is actually what ended his \"tricycle\" efforts the previous year; the nerves provoked him to deliberately spill the wine and run out.Seeing the opportunity Ted has, Barney decides to coach him into winning the belt and tells Ted to open proceedings with a foot massage and then use \"the mortality angle\" (we can all die at any point in time. So, don't postpone joy), but by the time he leaves the bedroom the girls appear to be gone. When he hears giggling coming from Lily and Marshall's room, Ted peers in then enters with a smile on his face.Cutting to the next day in the bar, Barney, Ted, Lily and Marshall are discussing the night, and Barney demands to know what happened. Ted will not divulge any information (even when physically offered the belt), which annoys Barney to no end.The final scene recaps events at the restaurant the previous night, where Robin's date asks the waitress to check if Robin is still in the bathroom. Peering in to see Robin sprawled, semi-conscious on the floor, she tells him no one is in there and the window is open. Seizing the moment, the waitress then leaves with Robin's date and Robin finally comes out of the bathroom to try and salvage the night, only to note that her head is bleeding, before collapsing again.", "episode_13": "Ted (Josh Radnor) is at the clinic to remove his tattoo, where he is attracted to his doctor, Stella (Sarah Chalke). They agree to go to a movie, Plan 9 from Outer Space (which Stella insists is the worst movie ever made), but Ted does not realize Stella had brought her friends along with her, and it was not a date. Ted tells one of the friends that he thought it was a date, and the news reaches Stella. Stella says that as per the AMA rule, she is not allowed to date patients.\nAt the next session, Ted suggests waiting till his ten sessions are over before asking her out, but Stella tells him she will still say no (even though she is not married, has no boyfriends, is not a lesbian, and doesn't only date black guys).\nBarney says women take only 8.3 secs to decide if they will sleep with a man.\nTed still feels that over ten weeks, she will start to like him, so decides to keep trying. Ted screams like a little girl due to the pain from the laser.. His friends believe it is not going well for him.\nEven though the first five sessions go well (2nd session Ted tells her about himself, 3rd session they speak only French, 4th session Ted makes her laugh so hard she falls off the chair, 5th session Ted juggles), Stella confirms her answer is still no.Ted decides that being nice to the receptionist, Abby (Britney Spears), would be a good way to let Stella see his good side, but instead, Abby starts to show interest in him. Upset that this didn't work, Ted tries using a self-help book he saw in Stella's clinic. When he tries talking to her about this, she reveals it isn't her book, and she detests it, while Abby confirms that Ted was reading the book in the reception.Robin (Cobie Smulders) suggests Ted give up on Stella and instead focus on Abby (its nail the receptionist time). Barney (Neil Patrick Harris) agrees, as he made an appointment with Stella to check what she was like, and discovered she had a condition where she is only attracted to men with mustaches (Folicula Felia). Although Ted does not believe him, he still tries to grow a mustache, which Stella laughs at (a year earlier, Barney had made a ten-dollar bet with Ted that he could get him to grow a mustache).Upset, Ted says he gives up, but Lily (Alyson Hannigan) tells him to try again, as Stella is interested in him, though she says she has not been to see her. It is then revealed that Marshall (Jason Segel) had gone to see Stella to talk up Ted, and found out Stella had a crush on him. Happy that Stella is interested in him, Ted asks her out after his last session, but she says she does not have time for dating because she has a daughter.After a while, Ted realizes she didn't actually say the word 'no', just that she didn't have time, and so decides to take her out on a \"two-minute date\" - to dinner at a table at the cafe next door to her practice and \"the important parts\" of Manos: The Hands of Fate at the electronics store two doors down (which Ted claims is the worst movie of all times), with help from Ranjit (Marshall Manesh). The date goes well, and Stella promises to call if she ever has time.\nFinally, Abby sees Ted outside the clinic holding flowers he tried to give to Stella, and chases him down the street (thinking that Ted got those flowers for her). She is then seen at the reception telling Barney about how he toyed with her emotions, after which they go out to have sex.", "episode_14": "Future Ted tells his kids, that back when they were younger, Uncle Marshall and Ted were really into college basketball.Marshall and Ted are working on filling in the brackets for the college basketball playoff games when the girls come into the living room and ask what they are doing. Lily asks where he got the chalkboard and Marshall tells her that he found it, but Marshall recounts in his head that they borrowed the chalkboard from Lily's classroom without permission. Barney walks in and tells them that the team that they bet on just lost. Barney tells everyone that he went to the hardware store to meet women (single, recently single, recently divorced, recently widowed, and lesbians tend to go there alone). He flirts with a woman in the store and when Barney returns after grabbing something, she slaps him. This also happened at the pet store (women looking for pets after a breakup but finding Barney instead) and the museum (where people go to appreciate art before losing their vision); every time he returns from getting water, he gets slapped. Barney can't figure out what is going on.The next night, Barney and Lily meet up at the bar, and when Barney walks off to get something, a girl approaches Lily and warns her that Barney will say anything to have sex with her. Lily is upset and tells Barney, but they can't find the girl, and Barney can't figure out who she is. Barney tries to think about who it could be and goes through hundreds of girls in his mind, getting overwhelmed.Barney complains to everyone, and Ted suggests that he looks at the list of girls he has been with. Barney brings everyone to see the scrapbook he has made, and Lily can't identify the girl. Barney gets an idea that he put the girls on the basketball bracket chart that Marshall and Ted have, and he suggests that they discuss the girls and figure out who it is. No one wants to do it, but Barney brought beer. They all argue about who has the most reason to dislike him and sabotage him.\nAfter several hours, they narrow it down to the final four and decide to contact all the women. Lily and Barney first visit Meg, the girl that he had sex with in the first apartment that Marshall and Lily bought (she was later arrested for trespassing, bit a cop, and spent 8 days in jail). Barney wants to hide from her, but Lily makes him apologize to her. When Meg sees them, she runs up to Barney and kisses him. When Lily separates them, she tells Barney that she isn't the one, but he still needs to apologize to her. He quickly walks off in the other direction. The next girl, Anna, believed Barney was Ted and got lied to. She tells him that she created a website detailing Ted's exploit. Barney stands on a table and announces to the whole restaurant that Ted Mosby is a jerk and tells everyone to visit the corresponding website.\nThat website went on to get 400,000 hitsThe next girl is Kate, whom Barney told he had a twin brother named Larney and had sex with her twice. She immediately attacks him, and Lily makes sure to capture a picture. The next, and last girl is Holly. Barney recalls the story of leaving her in the woods by herself, and a bear chased her. Lily scolds him, telling him it was the worst thing he has ever done. Holly answers the door and introduces her fiance, Mark. They invite Barney and Lily into the house for coffee. Barney says that was the worst Fourth of July, but Mark reminds Holly that they started dating in June (which means Holly cheated on Mark).Lily gripes at Barney when they get back to the apartment that he never apologized to any of the women. Barney doesn't think that is bad, but what he does think is bad is that he still doesn't know who the woman is. Robin suggests that they set her up, and Robin will act as the girl Barney is trying to seduce. Robin sets up the scene where Lily will be at the jukebox, the guys will be at the booth having a normal conversation, and Robin will walk up and get seduced by Barney. Robin asks what he says to women to get them to have sex with him, and he tells her. She gets a little intrigued. When Robin sees someone coming in, Barney walks off to the bathroom, and the girl approaches Robin.\nBarney returns from the bathroom and looks at the bracket to find the girl, and he doesn't recognize her at all. When she walks off, Barney intercepts her and apologizes for not recognizing her. Lily approaches and tells him that she isn't the girl (she was a friend from work), and the girl walks away. Lily takes a picture and names it \"Barney's Redemption.\"Barney writes in his blog on the computer: \"Sometimes we search for one thing but discover another. Even though I didn't find the mystery girl...I did find out something very important about myself...I'm awesome.\" A girl interrupts him and asks him to come back to bed with her since he must go to outer space the next day", "episode_7": "Marshall and Lily finally become tired of Ted's never-ending presence and his invasion of the married couple's personal space (Lily walks in on Ted shaving his genitals. Ted holds late night parties with Robin and Barney while Marshall has the bar exam the next day.. Then one day Marshall snapped when Ted didn't put the lid back on the peanut butter jar.. Turns out it was Lily who forgot to put it back on), so they decide to rent a new apartment.\nIn the newspaper they find an apartment in a neighborhood called 'Dowisetrepla', which is explained as part of New York City's tendency to shorten neighborhood names, and is supposedly an up-and-coming neighborhood in the city. The apartment is for sale, rather than for rent, but Marshall convinces Lily to go and view it.\nThis was One of 3 big mistakes in Marshall's life.. First was jumping off the roof, in an attempt to fly as a kid. Second was shaving his head at his wedding.Marshall falls in love with the apartment in Dowisetrepla (the agent is Margaret (Maggie Wheeler), imagining himself playing drums in a band with his future sons. Instead of haggling over the price, or looking at more properties, he books the apartment then and there.\nLily feels guilty because of the huge credit card debt (she has 15 maxed out credit cards) she hides from Marshall, but still imagines herself painting with two daughters, and so eventually ends up saying that she loves it.\nMargaret puts pressure on Marshall and Lily saying there are more people interested in the apartment, and they panic and decide to fast-track the sale. Lily tells Robin that they will apply for the loan in Marshall's name, to hide her debts, while she slowly pays it down.Meanwhile, Barney hooks up with a woman, Meg (April Bowlby). Meg is a commitment freak and Barney pretends to be one himself.\nHe takes the girl to the apartment in Dowisetrepla (he tells Margaret that he is also interested in the apartment and gets a spare key from her to visit it at night), has sex with her and then sneaks out while she is in the shower.The next day, Lily and Marshall apply for a mortgage (The banker insists that it has to be a joint loan since Marshall and Lily are married.. He gets her social security number as well and pulls her credit history), and Marshall finds out about Lily's debt (Marshall was hoping for a loan at under 6%, but is offered the same at 18% interest).\nLater, Ted, Barney, and Robin go home, where Ted discovers that Lily and Marshall were having a fight based on \"evidence\" strewn about the room. Label peeled off from the water bottle (which Lily does when she is guilty), an empty vat of ice cream (when Marshall gets angry, he eats), Lily cried in tissues in the kitchen, they had sex on the couch (Lily's bra on the couch), Marshall went out slamming the door behind him (titled picture frame by the door).\nTed incorrectly concludes the fight was over something minor (the peanut butter jar, Lily leaving the jar out after Marshall's repeated insistence to not do so). To prove his theory, Ted hits re-dial on the apartment phone, expecting the number to be Marshall's cell phone, which Lily would have called to apologize and make up. They instead hear the receptionist of a divorce lawyer, and panic.Robin reveals the truth to Barney and Ted about Lily's debt, and they all begin to consider how their lives will be with Lily and Marshall broken up. Barney cries and says that the world needs Lily and Marshall together.\nLily and Marshall return and explain that Lily had the idea of divorcing Marshall so he would not be dragged down by her debt (just on paper, so that Marshall can get his loan and the dream apartment). However, Marshall replies by saying, \"When I married you, I married all your problems, too.\" Finally, they exclaim that they bought the apartment.\nThe next day, Lily and Marshall take a taxi to their new home, but as they step out of the cab, they smell an extremely strong stench. The cab driver reveals that the area is near the sewage treatment plant, but the plant is shut down on weekends. They realize that \"DoWiSeTrePla\" is short for: DOwnWInd of the SEwage TREatment PLAnt and this reveals why the real estate agent wanted to sell the apartment.", "episode_16": "The episode begins with a montage of Robin, as Future Ted explains how much she has changed since her days as bubblegum pop star Robin Sparkles. At the bar, Robin announces that her former boyfriend, Simon (James Van Der Beek), plans to meet up with her later on at the bar. Robin tells the gang the story of how Simon broke up with her: He waited until she had loaded all of his band's equipment into their van to tell her that he was leaving her for Louise Marsh, whose parents had a pool.The group agrees that every time old friends come together, there is a clear winner and a clear loser. They begin to tally the points for Robin and Simon's reunion. Robin receives two from Barney for her breasts, one from Ted for Simon still living with his mother, one from Lily because Simon never became a rock star, and a final one from Marshall because Simon now works at a water park that doesn't even have a wave pool. Robin says there is no way he could come back from this 5:0 deficit, unless he got more attractive.\nSimon walks in and it is immediately clear that Robin should be the winner: he is balding, overweight, and wearing clothes that weren't even in style back in the 80's when he got them. While the whole group looks excited as to how much better Robin has done in the time since she and Simon were together, the camera pans to Robin, who is giggling uncontrollably and obviously still smitten.After watching Robin's reunion with Simon, the group retires to Marshall and Ted's apartment and begins criticizing the way Robin handled the meeting. Several flashbacks follow, including Simon's refusal to pay $4 for a beer, and instead pulling one out of his cargo pants; his bragging about his job at a water park (he claims he is saving lives); his claim that his band, The Foreskins (4 guys in a band, who play without shirts), are about to take off (just 4-5 gigs away from really exploding); and ending with the story of how Simon and Robin met - he starred in her second music video, \"Sandcastles in the Sand.\" Upon hearing this, Barney instantly leaves, claiming that he will not sleep until he has found this video.When Robin attempts to defend herself, the group discusses how being around someone from your past can cause you to revert to the person you were when you knew them, a phenomenon Marshall dubs \"re-vertigo.\" Marshall and Ted tell Robin that Lily suffers from this more than anyone else; to prove it, they have Lily invite her high school friend, Michelle, to hang out with them. Michelle (Ryan Michelle Bathe), who is almost done with her dissertation to get her Ph.D. in behavioral psychology, later states that the psychological term for re-vertigo is associative regression.The group is hanging out at MacLaren's the next day, when Robin tells them how Simon came to her apartment the night before claiming that breaking up with her was the biggest mistake of his life, and he asks her out on a date, which she accepts. The next night, Simon demands that Robin play a demo of his band on the news the following day at work. Immediately after this, Michelle arrives, and Lily immediately begins speaking in the most unrealistic but highly amusing urban style imaginable. The group continues to discuss other members' \"re-vertigo\", which includes Ted's high school buddy Punchy (Chris Romano). Ted becomes his high-school self with Punchy around.Marshall and Lily forbid Robin from seeing Simon again, but Robin behaves like a rebellious teenager and says they are just like her parents and can't understand her feelings as they were in love a billion years ago. Robin leaves to attend Simon's show and declares her intention to have sex with him later that night.In another scene almost identical to the story Robin tells at the beginning, Simon once again breaks up with Robin in the back of his van - once again for Louise Marsh, whose parents have put in a Jacuzzi. Robin tells the rest of the group and they all do their best to console her, but are ultimately unsuccessful and they all have to leave. Robin remains in the bar to drink alone until Barney arrives to complain about not being able to find the music video. Upon realizing what Robin is upset about, Barney consoles her until she asks him back to her place so that she can show him the music video. They watch the video over and over, making fun of the teenage Robin until, at the end of the scene, Robin and Barney begin kissing each other on the couch.", "episode_11": "Ted announces to the group that he is planning on taking out his tattoo removal doctor Sarah Zinman (Sarah Chalke) to a movie and is immediately met with disapproval. Barney mentions the Golden Rule: Although it is known commonly from the Bible as the ethic of reciprocity (\"Do unto to others as you would have them do unto you.\"), Barney's take on it is \"Love thy neighbor,\" which would lead into his Platinum Rule as \"Never ever, ever, ever love thy neighbor.\"\nHis point was that one should never date someone seen on a regular basis, e.g. someone at the same workplace, a next door neighbor, etc. because such relationships never work out in the end and lead to never-ending suffering, as those involved would see each other constantly.Barney begins to outline the Platinum Rule in 8 steps as the group begins to recount their past experiences against the Platinum Rule in an attempt to persuade Ted not to go on his date. He uses examples of Marshall and Lily getting too close to a neighboring couple (Michael (John Sloan) & Laura ( Kristen Schaal)), Robin dating a fellow news anchor Curt (Hayes MacArthur) and himself sleeping with Wendy the Waitress ( Charlene Amoia) at MacLaren's Pub.\nPlatinum RuleThe eight steps of the process1. Attraction\nBarney started noticing Wendy in Nov 2005, and she flirted with him.\nMarshall & Lily met Michael & Laura in Dec 2006, who had just moved in. They go for lunch\nCurt joined Robin at the station in Dec 2007. She was attracted to him as he was a hockey player, and as a Canadian Robin is a hockey fanatic\n2. Bargaining\nRobin justifies Curt, saying if he was missing teeth, she would have already had sex with him\nMarshall & Lily decide to invite Michael and Laura for dinner.\nBarney decides to seduce Wendy the waitress.. She is gullible, he is bored. If Barney screws over Wendy, he could kill the bar\nThey all think, if things get weird, they will just back off..\n3. Submission\nBarney has sex with Wendy. Curt takes Robin to a hockey game. Marshall & Lily have dinner with Michael & Laura.\n4. Perks\nThey start listing out the advantages of the relationships\nRobin can split a cab with Curt to work, standing lunch date and Curt got her into the locker room at the hockey game.\nMarshall & Lily are stoked that their new friends are right across the hall. Brunch double dates, game of charades and so on\nBarney gets free food at the bar. Barney believes that Wendy knows that this is a temporary fling.\n5. The Tipping Point\nCurt gets clingy with Robin. Barney hits on other girls at the bar and Wendy notices it.\nMarshall and Lily can't go out, as every time they try, Michael and Laura are just outside waiting for them.\n6. Purgatory\nCurt keeps leaving love notes for Robin everywhere. Marshall and Lily are trapped in their house.\nBarney cannot hit on women in his own bar.\n7. Confrontation\nThe inevitable \"talk\" takes place. Robin wants to go back to being coworkers with Curt. Marshall and Lily want to go back to being just neighbors. Barney wants to have a threesome with Wendy, if she is up for that, but the other girls have to be there\n8. Fallout\nCurt is devastated and cannot get it together even on air. Marshall and Lily resort to climbing down the fire escape, to avoid their neighbors, but even then they can't. Wendy forgives Barney, but now Barney cannot trust anything she serves him. Barney thinks she is trying to kill him and everyone close to himEven after all three experiences are recounted, Ted still decides to go. When he gets back, he tells the group that his doctor didn't consider it a date and that it is actually illegal for her to date patients. Future Ted reflects on the \"Platinum Rule\" and suggests there is a ninth step: Co-Existence, as we see the other members of the gang begin to do so with those they dated (except for Barney).", "episode_15": "After Marshall witnesses a work buddy Ferguson (Jordan Black) get yelled at after handing in a report, he becomes paranoid that his boss Arthur Hobbs (who is a senior partner at the firm), who is nicknamed \"Artillery Arthur,\" (Bob Odenkirk) will do the same to him after failing to complete a report on time (which is nicknamed the \"Ninja Report\" for easier understanding for the gang). Arthur yelled at Marshall and Marshall ended up crying being overwhelmed (he wanted to work for the NRDC, he is stuck at this job as he can barely afford the mortgage and the apartment is crooked and that Marshall is a grown man and no-one has the right to talk to him like that).\nMarshall explains that he doesn't know how to face Mr. Hobbs the next day (as he still has to hand in the Ninja report to him the next day). Robin suggests that he threatens him with a gun, but Ted comes up with another solution of talking like Abraham Lincoln. Marshall tells Ted that it isn't possible and tells him what he would say to Arthur, but Arthur just calls security.\nMeanwhile, Marshall has been working very hard starving Lily of sex, to the extent that she is always hot now.Marshall doesn't think that any of these ideas would work, but Barney gives him an example of Gary Blauman (Taran Killam) and what happened to him during a meeting. Bilson (Bryan Callen) yells at him in front of other people, but he interrupts him and tells him to \"Kiss my ass!\" since his cousin just had a website start up and was making money. He then stands on top of the conference table and tries to pee, but he gets performance anxiety and then eventually gives up.Barney tells him that the cousin's website eventually ended, Gary started working as a janitor, and eventually died. Barney tells Marshall that the moral of the story is to not yell at your boss because there is something called the \"chain of screaming\" and that it starts at the top.\nHe gives an example of Artillery Arthur and tells everyone that Arthur's boss's boss screams at Arthur's boss, then on down the chain it goes until it gets to Lily who screams at a student who then screams at her father who turns out to be Arthur's boss' boss.Barney explains that Marshall shouldn't deal with it - the way that the chain (or circle) of screaming works is that one person screams at someone \"below\" him, then that person screams at another person, and so on.\nThe next night, Lily and Ted are in the apartment looking at carpet samples for the new apartment and Marshall calls Ted and tells him to come downstairs without letting Lily know that it is him. Ted walks outside and finds Marshall stuffing his face. He explains that he and Barney went to a diner and was urged by Barney to scream at the waiter for getting his order wrong, but couldn't do it - the waiter screamed at Marshall instead (The waiter says he is at the end of a triple shift, that's 18 hours.. Then he needs to take 2 trains and a bus to Astoria where his wife will scream at him as he is never at home).\nFinally Barney convinces Marshall to yell at him instead. The next day, Marshall finally lets out his feelings towards Arthur (that this is not why he became a lawyer) and, in the end, quits his job at Nicholson, Hewitt, and West.\nMarshall feels that he is letting Lily down as she supported him through 4 yrs of law school and now they wont be able to afford the apartment either.\nLily tells Marshall that their future isn't the money or the apartment. She tells Marshall not to go back and beg for his job to Arthur.Meanwhile, Ted has bought himself a new car as he is dating Stella. All of his friends think a nice car is totally unnecessary in New York City (Barney calls shotgun for eternity) and proceed to eat ice cream and smoke cigars inside the car, despite Ted's protests. Eventually, Ted sells the car and gives the proceeds to Marshall to help pay for the apartment since he no longer has his high-paying job.", "episode_19": "Marshall and Lily face a dilemma when they discover that fixing the slanted floor in their new apartment will cost an additional $1,500. To raise the money, Marshall suggests selling some of Lily's designer clothes on a website. However, Lily playfully counters with a humorous suggestion to name the website similar to a guy forcing his wife to live in a garbage bag for the next three years, only to find out that the site already exists. As an alternative, Lily proposes selling her paintings, but Marshall unintentionally insults her by questioning their quality, claiming that people only pay for \"real\" paintings. Hurt by his comment, Lily decides to take matters into her own hands and sell her artwork within a week.Meanwhile, the gang engages in a discussion about Ted's seldom-worn red cowboy boots. They believe Ted doesn't have the style to pull them off, but Ted is determined to prove them wrong.Lily's attempts to sell her paintings prove to be challenging as she tries various venues, starting with an art gallery, then a local coffee shop, and finally ending up at the local flea market. After several failed attempts, her painting is eventually bought on the street by a couple known as G-CWOKs (Gay Couple Without Kids), who are influential in the art world. Excited by the sale, Lily contacts the G-CWOKs to discuss hosting an art party to sell more of her work. However, her excitement turns to devastation when she learns that the couple only bought her painting because of its vintage and valuable frame. To make matters worse, they confess to throwing away the actual painting.Marshall and Ted confront the G-CWOKs, Lawrence and Walter, who surprisingly appreciate Ted's red cowboy boots, proving that he can indeed pull them off. One of the G-CWOKs even develops a crush on Marshall, as Marshall has a strong appeal among gay men.\nThis encounter leads them to a nearby veterinarian's office, where they meet Dr. Greer, the veterinarian. Dr. Greer had discovered Lily's discarded painting in the dumpster and hung it up in Examination Room 3. To his surprise, the painting has a calming effect on the dogs being examined, though birds show no interest in it. Impressed by the impact, Dr. Greer offers to buy several of Lily's paintings that would be enough to cover the cost of fixing the slanted floor. Inspired by this opportunity, Marshall creates a website where Lily can sell more of her artwork to other veterinarians.Meanwhile, Barney continues to deal with a mysterious woman who has been sabotaging his attempts to seduce women by revealing his true intentions. Each time Barney's intentions are exposed, he receives a slap from his target. Determined to uncover the identity of this saboteur, Barney follows her from the bar to a taxi, only to discover that it's Abby, Stella's secretary. Abby confesses that she is in love with Ted and is hurt that he chose Stella over her. Barney seizes the opportunity to vent his frustrations about Ted, as he feels betrayed by their friendship. In a twist, Barney and Abby end up sleeping together again.Barney and Abby devise a plan to expose Ted's negative behavior in relationships. They decide to wear matching blue sweaters and announce that they are dating, with Abby unable to hide her lingering feelings for Ted. Ted becomes suspicious and warns Barney to stop, but Barney takes the prank to the next level by proposing to Abby. Unaware that it's part of the plan, Abby excitedly accepts the proposal and rushes off to share the news with her mother.Later, Barney visits Abby's apartment to retrieve a tie he claims to have left behind, only to find Abby already discussing wedding plans. Realizing he needs an excuse to back out, Barney tells Abby he can't marry her because he made a promise to Ted. He falsely asserts that Ted is still in love with Abby, providing her with Ted's address and suggesting she visit him at 2 am since Ted often works late."}, "season_2": {"episode_19": "Ted has planned out a bachelor party for Marshall, since he is his best man. Barney wants to offer some input, but Marshall has said that he does not want a stripper at his bachelor party. Barney keeps trying to convince Ted, but Ted doesn't want to hear any of it from Barney. Barney's idea of a bachelor party has a cramped hotel room, chairs arranged in a circle, filled with the closest friends, heat up to about 90, a metric tonne of cigar smoke, and a stripper in the middle (but not a beautiful one). She does things that demean the groom, herself and the entire human race. She was a 15 in blackjack, as in \"not sure if you would hit it\".\nThe party has the same characters, groom, best man, the man who only speaks in cliches (Stuart), the guy who disappears at the beginning of the night and doesn't show up till the end (Brad), and Barney.Ted's planned bachelor party involved watching a boxing match and eating large steaks from a cow he bought online. Barney foils this by amazingly getting a stripper named Treasure (Erin Cardillo) into the hotel room (even though Barney thought that they were going to Atlantic City rather than Foxwoods). Ted had changed the plans at the last minute (Ted calls it an honest mistake and winks at Barney), but Barney worked around it.\nMarshall says that Ted is his best man, but Barney says he has not yet decided and that's fine. He won't take no for an answer. Treasure has an elaborate act planned, which requires a sterile pot of water, a socket and everyone needs to sign releases.\nTo make matters worse, the stripper breaks her ankle, causing everyone to miss the boxing match (which was one for the ages) as she must go to the hospital, and then Barney demands that she continue on with the rest of her show, as she wants to do it (her daughters are about to start school and she can't afford to lose any jobs).\nThe rest of her show causes everyone but Barney to lose their appetite, and to top it all off, they are kicked out of the hotel due to a fire caused by Barney's cigar.\nMarshall and Ted return to MacLaren's bar, mad that Barney ruined the bachelor party.Meanwhile, Robin is in an awkward position at Lily's bridal shower, since (under Barney's advice) Robin has gotten her a \"battery-powered adult recreational fake penis\" (instead of a see-through nightie, which he said belonged in the 1850's), and most of Lily's guests are much older family members, as well as several young children and Lily's cousin Margaret (Corie Vickers), who is about to become a nun.\nRobin tries to stop Lily from opening the gift (she nods at her trying to indicate not to open the gift, but Lily gets her mother to give Robin a tampon, thinking it is Robin's time of the month) and finally switches cards with another present to disguise her gift. When Lily opens Robin's gift (which Lily believes to be from her grandmother Lois (K Callan).. Lois thought she was giving her grand-daughter an antique sewing machine, and before Lily opens her gift, she prefaces it by saying that the device has been in the family for generations, and before that they were made of wood, and before that they just did it by hand.. Her mother taught her how to use it. She had contests with her sister on who could finish first. And as a new bride this kept her busy on those long nights when grandfather was in Korea. Even grandpa used it once in a while), Lily is shocked, but then Robin reveals that it was actually her gift, and the other relatives express their amusement. Lily's mom wants to get one of those for herself.\nRobin offers to return the gift to the store, but Lily insists that she will keep it.Lily and Robin go down to the bar afterwards and are surprised to see Ted and Marshall there. They explain that Barney ruined the bachelor party, and Marshall is even considering not inviting Barney to the wedding.\nLily reveals a story: during the summer when the engagement was broken off, Barney, having had enough of Marshall's depression over losing Lily, flew out to San Francisco and told Lily to come back, as he thought they should be together, and that she might lose Marshall forever if she didn't come back. Barney goes on to tell Lily that he cannot keep stealing girls from Marshall forever, implying that he has been trying to provide an opportunity for Lily to return, even going so far as to purchase her a one way airline ticket. He then asks Lily if he should visit Alcatraz or Fisherman's wharf before his flight.\nAt this point, Barney is made co-best man with Ted, and Marshall is happy that Barney cares about their relationship.", "episode_18": "Ted and Robin start to move in together, as they decided in \"Stuff\". Initially, Barney likes this idea, and asks Marshall and Lily if he can use the apartment to sleep with other women, since his apartment is a 23-minute cab ride away, and that has ruined several opportunities for him (women have fallen asleep on him, made up with their boyfriends, or even been arrested for indecent exposure).\nBarney then decides it is the wrong thing for Ted to do (he says Robin can score a hotter guy than Ted and Ted secretly wants to hang out with his bro Barney. He reveals that Ted doesn't even know that Robin smokes and with him around, Robin wont be able to steal an occasional drag), and takes the moving truck (which has all of Ted's belongings, except one of the swords on the wall and a bunch of lids), and will not give it back to Ted until Ted completes a series of challenges.At Robin's, she is not OK with wanting to put a TV in their bedroom (Robin wants to move it into the storage unit in the basement). She also argues that Ted should move his only box of pot lids to the storage (as her kitchen is really small and she already has lids for her pots).After Ted is blackmailed (Barney says he will dump all his stuff in the east river, if Ted doesn't comply with his demands) to spend some \"bro time\" (Barney makes Ted pick up girls phone numbers, and play laser tag on what should have been his first night living with Robin) with Barney, the latter makes him realize that he really doesn't want to move in with Robin (Ted spent one afternoon with Robin and realized that Robin didn't want him there, not did he want to be there himself.. both realized that they made a huge mistake) ..\nTed gets angry at Barney and comes back to Robin's apartment. Meanwhile Robin was busy taking a bubble bath and a smoke, and canceling her subscription to guns & ammo magazine.Things do not become better there either, as Robin disapproves of Ted's behavior, such as when he puts his feet up on her coffee table. Ted is enraged at her (as her apartment is an hour away from the bar), but realizes where his truck is.Here, Barney has picked up a girl and the truck shown to be behind the MacLaren's bar in an alley, being used as Barney's makeshift apartment. As soon as Barney enters in with the girl, Ted starts driving the truck.\nLater, Ted sends the girl back to her home and gets his stuff back. He and Robin cancel their plans to move in.Meanwhile, Marshall and Lily are initially excited that Ted was moving out, since they would now have the place all to themselves. They enjoy lounging around naked (but admit that its not as awesome as they thought it would be) and having loud sex on the couch (he yells \"I am the best\" and she yells \"Ted's not here\", which is a turn off for each other), but soon find out that things have changed a lot. They miss Ted during all the things they used to do together, including watching their favorite shows.\nMarshall realizes that all the essential household items belonged to Ted (he did all the shopping and the microwave also belonged to him, including all the towels), which he has taken with him.\nMarshall narrates the story of a tree in the Amazonian rain-forest that can only grow around the body of an existing tree. Marshall and Lily are that tree, and they cant grow without Ted. They need to marry ted.\nAlthough Lily is against the idea of them marrying Ted, she also realizes how much they need Ted, and when Ted comes back and tells them that things did not work out and he is moving back in, they give Ted a group hug and tell him not to leave.Barney has a list of names for the truck, if Ted had not given it back.

Ted warns Robin that James is just like Barney, only gay, so she shouldn't be surprised. James arrives and Robin is very surprised to discover that James is black. James shares the same tastes as Barney. He plays laser tag, when skinny skydiving with him and wears expensive suits.\nRobin asks what the back-story is, and it is revealed that the two don't really know it; amongst other things, their mother says that Barney is white because she ate vanilla ice cream when she was pregnant with him, and James is black because she ate chocolate ice cream. But the explanations changed over a period of time, till when their mom refused to answer their questions anymore and called them racists.James is Barney's wing-man and warms up girls with gay talk and flattering them about their clothing choices and so on.\nJames tells them that they are young people living in New York (The greatest city on Earth) and that they should go out and have fun. The six of them go out, and James helps Barney pick up a girl with a back tattoo (James acts like a pig and tries to grope the girl, when Barney moves in \"saves\" her). Lily, Marshall, Robin, and Ted comment on the differences between single people and people in couples. Singles stay on their feet for maneuverability. Couples just want a place to sit. Single Stamina or Couples Coma. The girls lament that guys are always hitting on them at bars, and Ted and Marshall make fun of their \"poor little pretty girl\" syndrome.While they are discussing whether it is more difficult to pick up a girl or to deflect obnoxious guys picking you up, the group notices that James is acting strangely. He has been turning down an awful lot of guys tonight, complaining about his feet hurting him, and generally acting like the four of them. When they see James text messaging someone, they realize that he must be in a relationship and they have to tell Barney. Barney confronts James (after he realizes that James hasn't had sex with anyone in the bathroom stall), grabbing James's phone, which has a picture of James and another man on it. James tells Barney that the man in the picture is Tom, his fiance. James then asks Barney to be his best man. Barney says no, which crushes James.The next day, Barney goes to the apartment and laments that once gay men start getting married, everyone else will get married, too (because whatever gay people do, everyone else starts doing six months later), and single life as we know it will be ruined. Marshall points out that just because James is getting married doesn't mean things have to change, and Barney points out that the four of them have changed. Ted says that his sister married someone he didn't like, but he realized he had to support it anyway, and tells Barney he should do the same with James.\nBarney says he will take James out to celebrate, and takes him to a gay club. At the club, gay men hit on Ted and Marshall, and the two point out that getting hit on is flattering; meanwhile, the girls are excited that they can dance without being groped. However, after several men come on to Ted and Marshall, they become uncomfortable (8 gay guys hit on them in 10 minutes), while the girls realize they miss the attention and leave for a sports bar.Meanwhile, Barney tries to hook James up with other men. When James resists their advances (he tries to hook Barney up with single women instead), Barney accuses James of abandoning him and their way of life. He is determined to not let James get married. James surprises Barney when he tells him that he and Tom are adopting a baby. Barney is excited that he will be an uncle, and a year later, makes a toast at Tom and James' wedding. Marshall and Lily leave because of the time but Ted and Robin stay (hinting at the fact that they have broken up at this point, as they both have \"single stamina\"). Barney meets James's son, and promises to take him out on his 21st birthday and show him how to pick up women. The baby is also wearing a suit and Barney says \"great suit\".", "episode_1": "Throughout the summer of 2006, Ted (Josh Radnor) is extremely happy in his new relationship with Robin (Cobie Smulders), while Marshall (Jason Segel) wallows in depression following his break-up with Lily (Alyson Hannigan). Marshall told Lily that they should not speak, when she was leaving. But now he pines for her and Ted tries hard to make sure that Marshall does not come across as weak and pathetic.\nBarney (Neil Patrick Harris) is unhappy with all of them, being forced to endure either Ted and Robin being cutesy together or Marshall lamenting the loss of Lily. Ted and Robin haven't told anyone about getting back together, but Barney was able to figure it out by just touching them both.After forty days, Marshall has yet to leave the apartment and Robin, Ted, and Barney discuss the situation. Ted calls Lily selfish and immature. Ted has to constantly stop Marshall from trying to call Lily. Eventually, Marshall calls Lily and finds that she changed her number.\nBarney takes Marshall to a strip club, telling him that he hasn't gotten over Lily yet because he can still picture her naked (The human brain can only store a finite number of boob images or B-Pegs); unfortunately, all he can think about is Lily. Ted then takes Marshall to a Yankees-Indians baseball game, but when a couple becomes engaged a few rows down from them, Marshall freaks out and throws a hot dog at the couple. Security escorts him out of the stadium.Day 46, Robin, who has been hiding from Ted the fact that she likes guns, finally takes Marshall to a firing range, which cheers him up a little. Marshall knocks himself out with the recoil of his first shot. His good mood is short-lived, though (on Day 55), when he finds one of Lily's credit card bills in the mail. Looking at the charges on her bill, Marshall imagines that Lily has hooked up with George Clinton and they do everything that he and Lily didn't, like playing tennis and owning a ferret. These charges were over a month ago.\nBarney gives Marshall the idea to look at her online credit card statement to see more recent charges, and Marshall discovers that there are charges on the card for a hotel in New York. Despite Ted's best efforts, Marshall calls the hotel and a man answers the phone in Lily's room.Trying to convince Marshall not to go to the hotel, Ted finally gets tough on him, telling him he won't have a chance to win back Lily in his depressed, shampoo sniffing, sniveling, pathetic state. Marshall agrees not to go to the hotel, and Ted and Robin leave for a romantic weekend, putting Barney in charge of staying with Marshall. As they leave town, Robin and Ted discuss whether or not Ted was too hard on Marshall. Feeling guilty, Ted calls Barney to see how Marshall is doing, but Barney, having taken Marshall to another strip club, realizes that Marshall is gone. Ted and Robin turn around and head to the hotel to find Marshall.Ted finds Marshall in the hotel bar, and Marshall tells him that he had already gone up to Lily's room and punched the guy (Joey Adalian) who opened the door. He then found out that the guy wasn't Lily's new boyfriend; he had stolen Lily's credit card.\nTed tries to reassure Marshall that Lily didn't come back into town without calling him and she didn't have a new boyfriend, but Marshall is upset that the last link that he had to Lily was a lie. Ted reminds Marshall of the first time that they met in college, before Marshall had met Lily, and that he is someone outside of his relationship with Lily and encourages him not to let his break-up ruin his life.\nWhile Marshall doesn't immediately bounce back, one Sunday morning (day 67) he makes pancakes for Ted and Robin. As Marshall begins going out again, Lily appears at MacLaren's one night. She sees her friends having drinks and leaves unnoticed.", "episode_8": "Marshall and Lily are now back together (Marshall learned to cook over the summer) when Lily makes an off-hand comment about \"the man I'm going to marry\", then realizing they hadn't yet talked about still getting married. After Lily proposes to Marshall (Marshall makes her propose in a classy way) and having hot, passionate and amazing sex on the kitchen floor (with a creative use of Mrs. Butterworth's), Marshall tells Lily of how his family had harsh words about her when she left for San Francisco and canceled the wedding plans. His grandmother was particularly harsh on having some choice words for Lily.Lily is embarrassed to have a ceremony in front of Marshall's family, out of fear that they will judge her harshly, so they decide to elope to Atlantic City, New Jersey. They immediately go and find Robin at the news station, Ted at his architecture firm (where he is the project manager now after Druthers was demoted), and Barney at a salon getting a pedicure. After all five get a pedicure, they go to Atlantic City.\nLily goes looking for a bouquet and sends Robin to find some clothes that don't make her look better than the bride. Robin gets a tacky t-shirt which has a bikini bod printed on the front and back. Ted finds the printed bod super-hot.\nBarney, after finding Lily a veil, takes Marshall and Ted to a strip club for an 18-minute bachelor party (Marshall had a lap dance). Lily had given them 20 mins to find a veil, which they did in 2 mins only. Barney thinks he is the best man, even though Marshall insists that Ted is the best man and his best friend.When they approach the receptionist at the casino's wedding chapel, they find that the waiting period for a New Jersey marriage license is three days. They go to the courthouse to find a judge who will waive the waiting period (it can only be done in extreme circumstances like shipping off overseas to fight for the country. But Marshall and Lily say that Love is an equally strong reason for the waiver), and finally manage to get into a judge's chambers after staking out a bathroom.\nTed keeps staring at Robin's shirt boobs and wants to have sex with her in the courthouse bathroom.The judge, impressed by Marshall and Lily's committed, 10-year relationship, almost grants the waiver on the waiting period, but Barney reveals that Marshall and Lily broke up for six months, causing the judge to change his mind. Barney says he had to tell the truth since they were under oath, even though they had not taken any. Barney believes the courthouse is the oath and they are under it.\nRunning out of options, Lily suggests that they get married in international waters where they don't need a marriage license. Lily tells Robin that unless she gets married that day itself, she will have to face Marshall's family is a huge ceremony and she wants to avoid that at all costs.\nThey find a boat captain willing to marry them, but he wants $5,000 to perform the ceremony.Throughout the episode, Barney runs into a few Chinese men who he has brief but familiar conversations with, leaving the rest of the gang puzzled. He finally tells the group that he used to visit 'the AC' on a regular basis, but he developed a serious problem and stopped.\nBarney is sure he can win them the money. He enters a confusing Chinese game (Pinyin: X\u00edng H\u00e1ish\u00ec B\u00f9x\u00edng, Chinese for 'Deal or No Deal') that no one else understands. Barney has lost his entire life savings once, but that night he is feeling hot. However, after watching the game in action Marshall catches on (Ted's full name is Theodore), and counsels Barney to win enough money to pay the boat captain. Marshall's advice proves sound when Barney wins the game and the gang gets the money.Marshall and Lily are in the middle of their wedding when they decide they want to (and have to) face Marshall's family. They call off the wedding, however, the captain accidentally marries them. They ask him to undo the marriage, and the event becomes the story of the time that Marshall and Lily were married for 12 seconds.The end scene shows Ted coming out of his room wearing Robin's bridesmaid shirt and Lily wondering if Robin is here and Marshall saying \"man I hope so\"...", "episode_15": "Ted and Robin are running through the airport, trying to catch a plane to Chicago, where Ted has an interview with a large architecture firm for the job of running the company's New York branch. As they reach their gate, the attendant tells them they cannot get on the flight. They explain that Ted had to attend a court date that morning for jumping a subway turnstile (which is why he came to the airport not 2 hrs before like he usually does, but almost at the time departure), and she asks them to wait while she talks with the flight. While they wait, Robin suggests that their lateness was in fact Barney's fault.The show then flashbacks a few months to when Marshall had just broken his toe (before that Marshall believed he was indestructible). He is especially disappointed, as he had been training hard to run the New York City Marathon, which is the next day. Barney complains about his moaning, and states that running a marathon is easy, even without training. Marshall then bets Barney he cannot complete the marathon, and Barney-who has a gambling addiction-accepts the wager.The next day, to the group's surprise, Barney completes the marathon quite easily (the gang follows Barney's progress on Marshall's computer as each runner has a tracking chip), and shows no signs of being tired. Marshall pays up on the bet ($50), and tells Barney that marathon runners get to ride the subway free that day. Barney decides to ride the subway and show off the medal he was given for finishing the marathon.\nLater, Ted receives a call from Barney, who is stuck on the subway, after finding he is suddenly unable to move his legs. Ted agrees to come and get him, but in his rush, does not pay to use the subway, and so jumps the turnstile, explaining his court date in the present, but is tackled by a cop before he can help Barney, leaving him trapped on the train.The story then returns to the present, where Ted agrees the whole situation is Barney's fault. The attendant then tells them that their flight has already left, but they may be able to catch another flight leaving shortly. While making their way to the other gate, Ted remembers why Barney ran the marathon in the first place and realizes that Robin is to blame for the lateness.The story flashes back again, to April 2006, where Marshall decides to run the marathon to get into shape, with help from Lily and a guide book. One piece of advice suggests that the runner should apply petroleum jelly to areas affected by chafing, including the nipples. While following this advice, Robin walks in on Marshall, surprising him so much he falls, breaking his toe.In the present, Ted summarizes that if Marshall hadn't broken his toe, Barney would not have run, and not been stuck on the subway, so Ted would not have had to go to court, and they would not have been late. Robin tells Ted that she isn't to blame, and the reason why she was at the apartment that morning was because of Lily.In another flashback, Robin and Ted spot a line of people camping outside a wedding dress store for a big sale. The doors open at 8 am the next morning. When they tell Lily, she decides to go as well, and Robin agrees to camp out with her for the night. They cannot get any sleep because of a car alarm, so Robin decides to sleep at Ted's apartment that day, where she finds Marshall, causing him to break his toe.Meanwhile, Ted and Robin reach the second flight in time, and ask if there are any seats. While the attendant searches, Ted realizes it wasn't Lily's fault.A few months earlier, while riding the subway Ted found a penny from 1939 (during the events of The Scorpion and the Toad). Believing it to be valuable, Ted sold it to a collector, but only got $1.50. He and Robin decide to spend the money on hot dogs from the other side of town, which is where they saw the line for the dress store.Knowing the story doesn't go back any further (since there's no point in blaming the person who lost the penny in the first place), Ted concludes it was his own fault for missing the first flight, Ted is then told there are no seats on the second flight, meaning that he has to miss the interview. Ted is upset, but Robin comforts him and tells him that if the firm wants him they'll reschedule the interview. Future Ted reveals that the firm didn't reschedule and someone else got the job, however he now knows that it was his destiny not to get it after all. Three months later, the guy who got the job was made to relocate to Chicago and Future Ted knows that if he hadn't found the penny and triggered the whole chain of events then he might have had to leave New York, and never met his wife.In the closing scene, it is dark and Barney is still stuck on the subway with three thugs, forgotten by Ted. One toys with Barney's medal and he gives it up without a word, and the thugs leave.", "episode_14": "Ted's favorite holiday is Super Bowl Sunday. He has everything planned out continuing their tradition of watching it together with hot wings. The gang's plans are cut short when they find out a worker \"Mark\" at the bar has died. The gang doesn't know or remember Mark, but they are forced into going to the funeral otherwise they won't be allowed back in the bar.\nThe funeral starts at the same time as Super Bowl XLI, so they tape it figuring they'll watch it afterwards. The funeral is the one time that Barney does not suit up. Barney says suits are full of joy and thus only for the living. When he goes, he want to go in an open casket and buck naked. Open bar for the guys and a open casket for the ladies.The wake lasts too long (as Carl keeps them at the bar telling favorite Mark stories till 2 am) and they run out of time to watch the game. Ted wants to keep the tradition going as they have watched every game together since 2003. Marshall introduced Barney to gambling in 2004, when he won $20 on a bet that he didn't even understand. Since then, Barney is hooked to gambling.\nThey plan to not find out the score of the game until the next day to watch it together (which means they have to survive 18 hrs without finding out who won.. No TV, no internet, no newspapers, nothing). Ted works at home so no one can tell him the score while Barney handcuffs himself to Ted's wall, so he can't find the score, because he has a lot of money on the game.\nRobin does the best she can to avoid the media, even though she works in news. She stalls the sports report by constantly repeating the weather report, the traffic report and so on. But she closes her ears and drowns out any voices with her song when the actual report is read out.Finally Marshall goes to class with Lily for show and tell, but must bribe one of her students not to reveal the score. The boy is mean and gets Marshall to take the blame for his misdeeds\nTed leaves him alone while he goes to get the wings. He wears the \"Sensory Deprivator 5000\" (Duct tape on sunglasses with just 2 tiny holes to see out of, blinders with cardboard out of cereal box and high tech noise canceling headphones) to keep from learning anything about the game while he goes to the sports bar. He returns to the apartment, but realizes he has to make a second trip out for missing dipping sauce and heads back out. He slips on a stray pool ball and narrowly avoids hearing the score.Meanwhile, Barney escapes from Ted's and tries as hard as he can to find the score of the game. He runs into many people including Emmitt Smith, who have all missed the game.Marshall continues to be tormented by the student until he gets him back by spraying juice on his pants and threatens to tell everyone he wet his pants. Marshall gets his money back and the boy's pudding snack pack.\nWhile Ted is back in the bar getting the sauce, he trips but doesn't find out the score, Barney checks the newspaper, Robin hears the winner at the station, and a janitor has the radio on in the school revealing the score of the game to Lily (who covers Marshall's ears to keep him from hearing too), thus almost all of them know the score of the game without even watching it.Marshall, Lily and Robin head to Ted's but don't reveal that they know who won, and Barney promises he won't tell - only to be heard loudly screaming in Ted's room that he lost every bet thus ruining the game for everybody, since Ted knew who Barney bet on. Despite this, the five decide to sit down and watch the game anyway and still manage to enjoy themselves as much as ever.Future Ted finishes the story by telling his kids that he doesn't remember who won or even who played, but he'll always remember the evening as a fun one he spent with his friends. Later, Ted uses the sensory depravating device when Barney complains about all the sub bets he lost on the game.", "episode_7": "The guys go to a coffee shop, where Ted points out that Chloe (Morena Baccarin), the girl working there, has drawn a heart next to Marshall's name on his cup. Ted insists that Chloe has a crush on Marshall because she always laughs at his lame joke about how they fit a pumpkin into a pumpkin-flavored latte. As Marshall leaves, his name is called for pumpkin latte (that he did not order) on which Chloe has written her number.\nLater, when Marshall introduces Chloe to Ted and Barney at the bar, they tell him that she has the \"Crazy Eyes\", an indicator of future mental instability (Marshall cant see it as he is infected with \"havent been laid in a while\" blindness). Both Ted and Barney give Marshall examples of their experiences with this malady; Barney's crazy-eyed date wanted a threesome with a teddy bear, while Ted's crazy-eyed date picked up a long metal rod and repeatedly hit a car that nearly hit them as they were about to cross the street. Marshall shrugs it off.\nThe next day, as Marshall is taking a test, he receives a call from Chloe who says that she is being followed by a hunchback with a limp. Later, Marshall takes Chloe back to his apartment and suspects that she broke a picture of him and Lily that was sitting on the end table.However, it turns out that Lily has been hiding in the apartment, and pops out (much to Marshall and Chloe's surprise). Lily introduces herself, and leaves the apartment dejected and crying. Marshall follows her out to the steps, leaving Chloe sitting on the sofa.Lily confides in Robin that she is scared by the idea of Marshall going out on a date with another woman. Lily wanted to invite everyone for a wine tasting party at her apartment, but Ted tells her Marshall can't come as he is on a date.\nDespite hearing that Ted believes she has crazy eyes (Kinda like never dating a guy with perfect fingernails: jerk nails), Lily wants to see what Chloe looks like. It turns out that Lily was the hunchback following Chloe-she was carrying a book bag, then covered herself with a coat to shield herself from the rain (the hump), and limped because she hit her knee while concentrating on seeing the face of Chloe. Lily plans to pretend to be pregnant with Marshall's baby to lure him away from Chloe. Plan B is to get Chloe to have an accident.\nLily, while visiting Ted and Robin in the apartment, realized that Marshall had moved the picture of the two of them. She sneaked into the apartment later that night, before Marshall brought Chloe home to put it in a more conspicuous place, and it broke. While hiding from Marshall and Chloe, she got upset (when Marshall and Chloe moved to kiss each other) and popped out.Marshall talks to Lily outside the apartment and realizes that he should get back together with Lily even though he says that Lily has the craziest eyes he's ever seen (She admits that she was the hunchback with the limp and she broke the photo frame, not Chloe). Six months after Ted came back to the apartment and found Marshall alone and upset after the engagement ended, he returns to find Marshall and Lily happy and back together.\nThe gang first goes to McLaren's for a drink and then returns upstairs to the apartment, finding it has been ransacked by Chloe who has been \"searching\" for her \"lost\" keys which are in fact sitting in plain sight on the coffee table in front of where she had been sitting. Marshall points out the keys and Chloe departs, leaving a nonplussed gang and apparently proving the \"Crazy Eyes\" theory.Meanwhile, Chloe writes Barney's name as \"Swarley,\" prompting everyone to call him the name for the duration of the episode. Barney protests, but variations on the nickname become a running gag throughout the episode. He pretends to be OK with it, but the issue irritates Barney endlessly.\nJust prior to leaving the apartment, Chloe calls Robin \"Roland\", and Barney tries to use it as an opportunity to stop everyone from calling him \"Swarley\".\nIn the final scene, however, Barney walks into the bar, everyone shouts \"Swarley\", and he turns and walks out dejectedly as Carl the bartender plays the Cheers theme: \"Where Everybody Knows Your Name.\"", "episode_16": "Ted has been confusing his memories of events with Robin with those involving his previous girlfriends (like having romantic evening dinners, watched Van Helsing, Went to Maui). To hide this, he lies that he shared all of these experiences with his sister, so Robin does not get jealous. When he tells her this, she claims that he doesn't need to hide his exes, as they are both mature adults. But then she calls Ted a jerk for pointing out a girl that he made out with 3 years ago. She gets upset upon learning that most of Ted's possessions are from his ex-girlfriends (including the sweatshirt she is wearing). The moisturizer in the bathroom, phone booth, the lamp and the sweatshirt.Marshall asks Barney if he chose a mermaid (top half human, bottom fish) or inverted mermaid (top half fish, bottom human) to date. Ted goes with top half fish.Robin insists that Ted get rid of those things, upon which they ask Marshall, Lily and Barney for advice. Ted argues that the stuff left behind doesn't remind him of the girls he went out with, only the good times he had with them. For Robin all she now sees in the apartment is images of Ted's exes taunting her about all things he hasn't don't for her.\nOnly Marshall sides with Ted, which means that Ted has to throw them away. This is the same way the gang decided the 2005 landmark case of Lily vs the Marshall's Joey Buttafuoco pants. They didn't look any better with combat boots either.Here, Lily persuades the whole group to come to watch her in a friend's Off-Off-Broadway play (which was up 8 flight of stairs), despite protests from Barney (he compares asking someone to watch you in a play, to asking them to give a ride to the airport, crash on your couch, helping you move.. all the things for which professional help is available).\nWhen everybody comes to see Lily's play, they hate it (the building smelled like an old urine factory and the play was 3 hrs long), but only Barney confesses that the play was awful. Upon this, Lily tells that friends are supposed to be nice to each other and that if he were to be in a show, she would say only good things about it.\nRobin and Ted reach Ted's apartment and confess to each other that Lily's show was indeed horrible. Robin enters his apartment to find that it has been nearly robbed, only to learn from Ted that he gave all of the missing items to his ex-girlfriends.Everything is OK between Robin and Ted now, until Ted learns that all her dogs are gifts from her previous boyfriends. Robin counters that things with a heartbeat can stay. Now Ted flares up and demands that Robin should give up her dogs too. But this time, nobody agrees; however, an uncomfortable Ted sees Robin's ex-boyfriends' faces whenever he sees her dogs, and Robin begins to notice this (Ted runs away in the middle of sex, when the dog enters the room and starts to snuggle with Robin). Robin decides to give them away and tells about her decision to Lily. On learning that Robin gave away her dogs, Ted is a bit hesitant to let her in his apartment. Robin enters and finds that Ted has reclaimed his missing possessions from his ex-girlfriends. After a heated argument, they somehow make a decision to move in together. On announcing this to the rest of the gang, Marshall and Lily are excited, while Barney slaps his forehead.Barney takes up Lily's challenge and makes his own show named Suck It, Lily, clearly intending to rile her up. He produces a terrible show which involves repeating the word \"moist\" (which Lily is shown to hate earlier), squirting water through a water gun at the audience (especially Lily). Lily buckles down and admits to Barney that he has won and she has nothing good to say about his show. The rest of the gang prepares to leave, but Barney manages to make them watch the second act, which turns out to be so much worse that Marshall is forced to use his second slap to make Barney stop.", "episode_13": "Ted is trying to deal with his former boss, Hammond Druthers (he was very big in 80's and the worst boss Ted ever had in his life.. Druthers was demoted when he failed the pitch for the Spokane National Bank building), but when he can't, he decides to fire him. Before, Ted was one of the guys.. but now, he was the boss and the employees judged him on everything he did or said. The guys clammed up whenever he walked into the room. Ted was always working, even when he was not at work. Earlier, Ted would encourage people to call in sick for foo-fighters events, but now would catch people when they lied about being sick.\nTed wants Druthers to be put on a different project, but the Managing Partner is an old man who tells Ted to fire everyone on the project including Druthers and Mosby (not knowing that Ted is Mosby).. he thinks Ted's last name is Crosby.\nRobin cautions Ted, because when she fired her makeup assistant she messed up her makeup just before the broadcast and made her look like a whore and a clown.The first time he attempts to fire him, he is interrupted by fellow employees bearing a birthday cake for Hammond. The second time, Ted comes into the office one night and finds Hammond in boxers and a pajama shirt; his wife has left him, and he has been sleeping at the office. Once again, Ted's plan is thwarted, and he takes Hammond home to sleep on his couch.Despite Ted's altruism of letting him stay in his apartment (sharing breakfast, tossing him extra toilet paper in the bathroom and so on), Hammond continues to belittle his ideas in the office (when Ted pitches the ideas of columns for the Atrium, Druthers calls it stupid in front of everyone). He tries to fire him again, but just as he is, Hammond is handed his divorce papers and learns that his dog is dead. Then, the employees approach with another birthday cake, since they were in Montreal during his real birthday celebration days before.\nTed decides to fire him anyway, but Hammond suffers a heart attack in the process. Ted thinks he is faking it to keep from getting fired, and continues to mock him. Hammond is taken away in a stretcher. Ted convinces his co-workers that he did not cause the heart attack\nEveryone in the office initially hates Ted, but forgive him when he comes up with the idea of \"Margarita Fridays,\" complete with margarita machines.Meanwhile, Marshall is tormented by the picture Lily painted of him posing nude as a freshman at Wesleyan. Lily wanted to do a nude art study, and Marshall didn't want Lily looking at any random guy's junk. So, he posed nude for her instead.\nTed, Barney, and Robin find the painting behind the piano and have the bartender hang it up behind the bar at MacLaren's. Marshall manages to snatch it away by jumping at it.To Lily's surprise, Barney proposes that she paint him in the nude, as he was impressed by the quality of the drawing. He offers her a size-able sum of money ($5000), but Lily worries that it will upset Marshall. She talks him round by suggesting that they can use the money to spend their honeymoon in Scotland (where Marshall can connect with the Loch Ness monster, whom he lovingly calls Nessy), rather than their original plans to explore the country's caverns.\nMarshall later finds a more expensive castle to stay at, and tricks Barney into paying an additional $5000 by pretending to argue with Lily about painting another man in the nude.\nBarney is unhappy with the finished painting, complaining that Lily gave him the \"Ken Doll\" (not painting his genitals).", "episode_9": "Ted, Marshall, Lily, and Barney find out that Ted's girlfriend Robin never goes to malls (including the Willowbrook mall in NYC..) and refuses to explain why. Ted pretends to respect Robin's privacy in front of everyone, but privately badgers her to find the truth (arrested, dumped, found out that she was Canadian, mauled, trapped under a fake boulder?).\nMarshall posits that Robin was married in a mall in Canada (Lily tells Marshall that she will never get married to him at the Mall of America in Minnesota), while Barney believes that the secret is related to pornography. Barney believes that the more you know about a person the closer you get to the \"Oh\" moment, the one detail which is a deal breaker (pact with God to stay a virgin till marriage, turned 30, eating disorders). Ted believes in knowing about the Oh moment asap, rather than at the altar.\nMarshall and Lily tell each other everything. Marshall has never been to the Pacific Northwest as he is afraid of Sasquatch. Donkey ate his pants in Trenton. Had to pump out all the nickels from his stomach at Bill's bachelor party in Memphis.\nThe gang recollects that Robin talks a lot about her friend in Canada who got married way too young.\nThey agree to a Slap Bet (since Marshall didn't have $20,000 and Lily refuses to be the wager) (where the winner of the bet slaps the loser as hard as he possibly can, but no rings) and appoint Lily the Slap Bet Commissioner. If a problem arises and they need a ruling, that would be her job.Ted begins to worry that Robin is married. He again badgers Robin to just say that she is not married. After trying to avoid the issue, Robin tells Ted that she got married in a mall, after which her husband moved to Hong Kong without getting a divorce. Ted promises to keep it a secret, but tells the gang after Lily begs him. Marshall slaps Barney. Barney continues to look for porn from Canada to prove that Robin featured in a porn video.Law student Marshall searches a legal database, and tells Ted that there is no record of a marriage license for Robin in Canada. Ted can't ask Robin directly as she will know that he told Marshall. Marshall advises Ted to lawyer Robin, by asking her a bunch of questions about the marriage very quickly and see how she responds. After asking her various questions about her wedding, Ted confronts Robin (when she can't answer her husband's name) and she admits she is not married, but finds out that Ted told Marshall her supposed secret. She is angry and refuses to tell Ted the true reason she avoids malls. Marshall tells Lily that Robin is not married and Lily, as the slap bet commissioner, must allow Barney to slap Marshall three times.Startling Robin, Barney reveals that a man in Malaysia has found a video with \"Robin Sparkles\", and it will appear on Myspace shortly. Ted is no longer interested in finding out Robin's secret, but Robin insists that it is time for the secret to be revealed. Barney plays the video's opening, in which Robin (dressed as a schoolgirl) seductively pleads with a teacher not to give her detention.Not wanting to further embarrass Robin, Barney pauses the video, says that he has proved his point, and slaps Marshall. Robin asks Barney why he slapped Marshall, and Barney tells her about the bet and that he thought that Robin had done porn. Robin plays the video, stating that she wishes it were porn. It is a music video where \"Robin Sparkles\" sings \"Let's Go To The Mall\", Robin's minor bubblegum pop hit in Canada as a teenage pop star.Marshall points out to Barney that he did not win the slap bet. Lily gives Barney the choice of either ten slaps from Marshall immediately, or five slaps at any time till eternity. Barney chooses the five slaps, which Ted refers to as a \"horrible call\", because Barney must now live in constant fear of being slapped. Robin tells Ted that she is glad Ted knows her secret now. They kiss and Marshall slaps Barney, proclaiming, \"That's one\". They all enjoy the video, and Marshall glares at Barney.", "episode_4": "After having their first fight as a couple, Ted meets Marshall and Barney at MacLaren's while Robin meets Lily in a nail salon.\nAt work that day, Ted's boss unveiled a design for a skyscraper which is remarkably phallic (78 floors tall pink marble tower with a rounded top and 2 spherical entryways at the front. This is a huge project and if the firm doesn't get the contract it could go under), but when he tried to tell Robin about it, she said that she didn't want to hear about his job because his work stories are uninteresting compared to hers. She even goes on to say that she doesn't like Field of Dreams (she calls the movie stupid, and it is on the all time best movies list for the guys).\nLily explains to Robin that even if she is not interested in Ted's work, listening is still an important part in a relationship. Robin believes that Ted is mad because of her comments about the film and not about his job (in fact, he is very upset about both things).Marshall asks Ted to join him at a law school party, but Ted has to return to work. Barney tells him that his job isn't boring: women think that architects are hot, and Ted just needs to present his career with the right attitude. As the three leave for their evening plans, Ted approaches a woman at the bar and asks her what she thinks about architects. She tells them that she thinks that architects are sexy, and they begin chatting.Robin heads to MacLaren's with Lily to apologize to Ted, but he isn't at the bar. Robin asks the bartender about Ted, and a woman at the bar tells her that he left with her friend Anna (Dawn Olivieri) to go Marshall's law school party. Robin is calm, happy that Ted found someone to talk to about architecture so that she doesn't have to hear it. Lily can't believe that Robin isn't jealous that Ted is hitting on other women. Robin says that she is picturing the other woman as unattractive, but when her friend says that she is a kickboxing instructor and looks great, Robin decides to go to the party to check on Ted.Lily and Robin go to the law school party and ask around for Ted. The party's host, Brad (Joe Manganiello), speaks reverently of Ted Mosby the Architect, but says that he left with his date and Marshall to go dancing at a techno club, Posers. Upset that Ted, who hates clubs, would go dancing with another woman, Robin tries to call him to apologize. When Ted doesn't answer his phone, Robin calls Marshall, who tells her that Ted is at work. Shocked that Marshall lied to her, Robin realizes that Ted is cheating on her.At the club, the bouncer (who also refers to \"Ted Mosby the Architect\") tells them that Ted left with his date to go to her apartment across the street. After a bribe of her clutch purse, the bouncer tells Robin where Ted's date lives, and the girls go to the apartment. Finding the door unlocked, they sneak in and discover Barney in the woman's bed. Robin asks where Ted is and Barney replies that Ted is at work. Barney then tells them that he has been pretending to be Ted all night, introducing himself as \"Ted Mosby: Architect\" to the woman at MacLaren's after Ted left.Lily reassures Robin that everything is fine because Ted isn't cheating on her, but Robin says that she hates how crazy and paranoid she has been acting. Lily tells her that people act crazy and paranoid in relationships, and she really misses those feelings. Leaving his standard goodbye letter for the woman he just slept with, Barney, Robin and Lily flee.\nRobin brings donuts and coffee to Ted at work, apologizes for their fight, and tells him that she wants to be the person to whom he complains about work. Ted shows her an alternate design for the skyscraper that he has been working on, and Future Ted tells his kids that it was the first time he'd ever shown his drawings to someone; what's more, the skyscraper ended up being built and he had pointed it out to them when they had previously visited Spokane as a family.The woman Barney slept with finds his goodbye letter on the bed, wherein Barney pretended to be a ghost who could only spend a day on Earth every 10 years, and \"chose to spend it with [her].\" However, he slips up as he signs the letter \"Barney\" (when she thought he was Ted Mosby), leaving the girl utterly confused.", "episode_22": "With Marshall and Lily's wedding reception in full swing, Ted and Robin begin discussing a big announcement, and when Barney overhears, he harasses them until they relent, telling him of what happened 2-3 weeks before the wedding. Ted and Robin say that they have not revealed it before because of the wedding.Before the wedding, the gang had discussed a list of wedding cliches to avoid including a soul train line dance, or a collection of photos from Lily and Marshall, or a bible verse that they recite at every wedding.In the restaurant where Ted and Robin had their first date, Ted and Robin receive two complimentary glasses of champagne. Robin discovers an engagement ring at the bottom of the glass, and begins to think that Ted is proposing to her. Barney reacts in horror at the thought they might marry, and Ted reveals Robin reacted with similar horror. The proposal was actually meant for a couple at another table; when the mix-up is clarified, the other woman accepts, but Robin's horror and subsequent relief unearths unresolved issues between Ted and her.The restaurant owner recognizes Ted is the man who stole his blue French horn, Ted runs away, but runs into a waiter, food getting all over Robin and him. The restaurant owner forces Ted to return the blue French horn in order to get his credit card and driver's license back.\nThey go to Robin's apartment, and Robin discusses that she does not want to settle down, and that she has always wanted to travel the world, going to places such as Argentina. Ted also expresses this desire, saying that he wished he had studied abroad for a year while at college and claiming that Argentina also needs architects. Since he just finished a big project at work (the Seattle project), he feels that now is as good a time as ever to travel the world.\nBarney is again disgusted by this idea, not on the terms of their relationship, but due to concerns of his being lonely in New York and Argentina being economically unstable.Ted and Robin then discuss the issue of kids. Robin does not want to have kids, but tells Ted that \"if I were to have anyone's kids, I'd have yours\". They initially decide to hold off, but then decide to take the risk. At this point, a terrified Barney believes that Robin is pregnant with Ted's child. His fears seem confirmed when he sees Robin catching the bouquet and making a point of not drinking.As Marshall and Lily leave on the honeymoon, Ted and Robin then reveal that after they had sex that night, they realized that their relationship wasn't heading in a direction either of them wanted to follow, and that they could no longer pretend that these issues did not matter to them. After exactly a year of being together in a relationship, Ted and Robin break up, although they decide to remain on amicable terms. This further stuns Barney, who wondered why he had not heard. Through a flashback to the episode \"Showdown\", they explain that they decided to hold off announcing the breakup because of Lily and Marshall's impending wedding. As Robin is asked by a little boy for a dance at the wedding reception, Barney tells Ted that even though he had always joked about the two of them breaking up, he thought that they were a good couple. Ted agrees, but says that they were not headed in the same direction. Ted then gets a drink from the bar and a cigar from Barney, and tells an overjoyed Barney that he's going to need a wing-man again. Future Ted then reveals that they eventually both got what they wanted out of life; Robin went on to travel the world, while Ted met his future wife. Ted no longer considers Robin to be \"The One\", and is finally able to move on.Meanwhile, Marshall and Lily could not eat at their own wedding reception because of things such as food being taken right out from under them and relatives congratulating them just as they were about to get a bite. Lily also gets drunk, and misses in her attempt to feed Marshall some cake. When they finally get to the limo, which is driven by Ranjit (Marshall Manesh), Marshall asks them to stop at a fast-food restaurant so that they can get something to eat. At the restaurant, Marshall begins to fully realize that Lily is his wife, and his realization makes him very happy.\nThe season ends with Ted accepting Barney as his wing-man, and Barney declaring the summer is going to be \"Legen- wait for it....\"", "episode_12": "Robin realizes that she is in love with Ted but she can't bring herself to say it, instead blurting out \"falafel.\" While recounting the story to Lily, Robin admits to Lily that she's never said \"I love you\" to a man before as none of her past relationships have progressed that far.\nBarney says relationships are like freeways with pre-defined exits. The first is 6 hours, then 4 days, then 3 weeks, 7 months, 18 months, 18 years and death. Robin says she has never been on the freeway this long.Robin's sister Katie (Lucy Hale) is coming to visit New York for the first time, and Ted suggests that he and Robin take her to the Empire State Building. When Katie arrives, Robin is surprised to see that she is with her boyfriend Kyle (Ryan Pinkston), who is in town visiting his cousin; Kyle is immature and obnoxious, spending all his time ogling attractive women in front of Katie. Katie tells Robin she's planning on having sex with Kyle the following night, and Robin recruits everyone else to help her convince Katie not to.The gang takes Katie to the Empire State Building the following morning, which they use as a thinly-veiled metaphor for waiting for sex. Katie gets annoyed and accuses Robin of being a hypocrite. She says that she read Robin's diary and knows Robin lost her virginity when she was 16 (Barney offers Katie $10,000 for that diary). Frustrated, Katie stalks off to smoke.Everyone reflects on the first time they had sex. Barney tells them a story that turns out stolen from Dirty Dancing. Lily and Marshall did it in college; they wanted to wait and make it special, but did it in his dorm room with Ted in the top bunk.\nIn the middle of sex, Robin's boyfriend admitted that he was gay. Robin says that they only \"barely\" had sex, and when Lily says it doesn't count, Marshall realizes that she went halfway with her high school boyfriend, Scooter (David Burtka). Lily doesn't understand why Marshall is mad at her, because she didn't really have sex with Scooter. She compares it to being in the Empire State Building; they're in the lobby right now, and nobody buys tickets to get to the lobby. It doesn't count if you don't get to the top.Katie comes back and says she's going to see Kyle. Robin says that Katie only has one chance to lose her virginity and that she should do it with someone special, not Kyle. Katie points out that Robin has done it with \"a hundred\" guys and she couldn't have been in love with them all. Robin insists that she had some kind of feeling for all of them, and Katie puts her on the spot by asking her if she loves Ted. Ted pulls Robin aside and tells her that it's no big deal. Robin says that she just doesn't want to do it too soon. Ted asks, \"Like I did?\" Robin calls him an \"I love you slut\" and he calls her an \"I love you prude\". Ted then takes his \"I love you\" back.Future Ted tries to convince his kids that when Katie slept with Kyle, she got pregnant with quintuplets, moved into a trailer park, and died an alcoholic. But in reality, Katie doesn't sleep with Kyle. Robin says that Katie admits it was because Ted told Katie about his first time, in which he told a girl he loved her when he didn't, had sex with her and he never saw her again. He told her that all 17-year-old boys just want sex and will say anything to get it, even the nice ones. Katie tells Kyle she wants to wait and he dumps her. Robin tells Ted that the story doesn't sound like him, and he admits that it happened the other way around (the girl didn't mean it when she said she loved him). Robin then tells Ted that she loves him and they kiss.At the end of the episode, the group takes Katie back to the Empire State Building, and Marshall says that the last trip didn't count because they didn't get out of the lobby. Lily points out that, by that logic, he is the only one she's had sex with. Later that day, after Katie has left, they go to the bar and beg Barney to tell them the real story of his first time. He tries unsuccessfully to describe sex scenes from various movies before admitting that he was 23 and it was with his mother's 45-year-old friend Rhonda (Stephanie Faracy). Realizing how much this embarrasses Barney, the group decides to pretend they never heard the real story.", "episode_17": "Ted and Marshall begin the story in Marshall's Pontiac Fiero. The car is about to hit 200,000 miles on the odometer, and Marshall is excited, since the Fiero has served him well. He even has cigars in the glove box ready for the occasion. Although, upon looking, Ted can only find two sets of chopsticks. However, Marshall hits a pothole, and the Fiero quits running just before it hit 200,000 miles. In the shop, Marshall is saddened (since the car represented who he was and he wanted to hold on dearly to that.. his brothers had given the car to him when he turned 16), and everyone begins sharing stories about the Fiero.Marshall tells the story of how he had to prove himself worthy, of the car (which had 72108 miles on it by that time), in the eyes of his brothers by ordering 12 cups of coffee at the drive-thru while sitting naked in the front seat (his brothers had already gone ahead and bought out all the trays and lids. Then they jumped out and surprised him, causing him to jerk the car and make the hot coffee spill all over him). He also uses this to tell why he has never allowed food or drink in the Fiero (not even groceries).Ted then tells his memorable moment with the Fiero, known as both \"Fieroasco\" and the \"100k Fiasco\" (the Fiero was approaching 100,000 miles at that time), which began during their freshman year of college (Marshall and Ted weren't really good friends yet), when Marshall offered to drop Ted off at his parents' house in Ohio (and split the gas money) on his way home to Minnesota for Christmas break. They had started to bond on trip, while a cassette was stuck in the player so they could only hear one song over and over. Ted starts to play Zich-dog (you have to yell \"Zich do\" first, every time you see a dog), but Marshall wins every time 82-0. Ted tells of how they got lost on a back road (Ted wanted to take a short cut as he was bored on the highway. Plus they had no food or water, due to Marshall's no food in the Fiero rule), had to cuddle together to stay warm when a snowstorm hit (soon, their battery died and they had no choice.. Marshall admits that he loves Lily and someday he is going to marry her) - and found out they were parked in front of a small bed-and-breakfast with a man and his dog staring at them the next morning.The mechanic tells Marshall that the car is not worth saving and will cost $3000 to fix.\nLily and Robin feel the need to come clean about something, and they tell Marshall about the time they took the Fiero to get Thai food but spilled it in the passenger compartment. They carefully cleaned it up, smoked the cigars that Marshall had been saving for the passing of 200,000 miles, and wrapped two chopsticks in napkins, hoping Marshall would never discover what they did.Finally, Barney says that he doesn't understand any of their feelings for the car. Ted then tells of Barney's only memory with the Fiero, which was the time Ted taught Barney how to drive in it (189441 miles), and Barney was scared of driving ever again (even though he never left the parking lot or went much above 10 mph). Barney panicked when a dog came in front of the car, even though it was more than 50 feet away and the car had a few minutes before it ever came close to harming it.\nBarney calls the Fiero a death trap. That was the moment when he decided never to drive again.Marshall accepts that the car has had a great life and deserves to move on. He agrees to give up the car for scrap. He is OK with the car not completing 200,000 miles, as none of them have achieved their life goals either. He wants to get a new car for his new memories with Lily. Their first house, the first car their 2 kids remember and so on.\nTed says that the car has done a lot for them and convinces the gang to push it the last 0.7 miles to get it to the landmark.\nAlthough all five of them attempt to push the car to 200,000 miles, they give up (the back wheels were on blocks), and say goodbye to the car. Future Ted states the remains of the car were sold for enough money to help pay the gang's bar tab for the next 2 days.Marshall had put the cassette into the Fiero when it had 66334 miles on it. It was the last thing it gave back to Marshall (it came unstuck) before it headed for scrap.", "episode_20": "As the date of their wedding approaches, Marshall and Lily suggest spending the two weeks before the wedding living away from each other, but think that their bond might be too strong. They are shown sharing sensations such as a stomach ache and following each other everywhere. Robin suggests Lily come live with her, while Marshall helps Ted with his best man's speech.\nMarshall makes a tape for Lily where he sings night-night to her.While living with Robin, Lily tries on her dress, only to find she has lost so much weight that it no longer fits. Since fixing the dress is too expensive ($300 to take the bust in), Robin forces Lily to binge to gain weight. Lily enjoys it at first, but actually loses more weight instead of gaining. Robin increases the pressure until Lily is unable to handle it.Meanwhile, Ted is having trouble writing a best man's speech which Marshall is happy with, as he wants no mention of sex or drinking. Once Marshall was pulled over for driving alone in a carpool lane (Lily was giving him a blow job). Ted then tries a funny story about how Marshall accidentally first said \"I love you\" to Lily, but Marshall doesn't want her to hear it. The gang was in college and Ted had gone out to get snacks. Marshall and Lily were wasted. When Ted returns, Marshall says \"I Love You\" to Ted, but Lily thinks he said it to her, and says the same back.\nFinally, Ted tries to censor a night out by replacing shots of alcohol with chocolate milk, and replacing sex with holding hands. When Marshall complains this story is boring, Ted states that this is the best he can do with Marshall censoring him.\nThe episode then cuts to Marshall and Lily's wedding, where Ted is making his speech, and is telling them about his difficulties writing the speech, until he found Marshall coming back to the apartment in the middle of the night. It is revealed that Lily and Marshall had been sneaking out every night and meeting at a hotel to spend time together, and also for Lily to eat enough to fit into her dress. Ten yrs into their relationship, they could not spend even a single night apart. May they never have to again.At the same time, Barney is preparing to see a taping of The Price is Right, and is practicing by learning the prices of various items, as well as how to properly spin the Big Wheel so as to land on the dollar. Barneys says TPIR is a microcosm of their economic system where consumers are rewarded for their persistence, market acumen and intrepid spirit.\nWhen asked why this matters so much, Barney explains that he wants to impress Bob Barker, who his mother told him is his biological father. She was bored, and just pointed to Bob on the TV, when Barney asked her who his father was.\nAfter being called on down by TPIR announcer Rich Fields, Barney's knowledge of prices is shown to be excellent to the point where, while playing Clock Game, he spends most of the 30 seconds he is given showing Barker pictures of himself. He tells the price of his prize at the last second, gets a dollar on the Big Wheel in the Showcase Showdown (Barney was nervous about this part, but is ready when Bob says \"you will do just fine, son\"), and bids the exact price of his Showcase, thereby winning both the showcases.However, Barney loses the nerve to tell Barker that he believes the host is his father; and instead, congratulates him for \"35 years of hosting The Price is Right\". He then gives all of his prizes to Marshall and Lily for their wedding.", "episode_21": "Marshall and Lily are about to get married in May of 2007, however, nothing seems to be going right for either of them. They started 8 months out with a small outdoor wedding, with only family and close friends, and an acoustic guitar playing. 6 months out, the number of guests increased to triple digits. 5 months out, it's not an outdoor wedding, since Marshall's dad is convinced that he will be mugged at an outdoor wedding in New York. 3 months out, the acoustic guitar player is replaced by a harp player (Lily's dad owes a guy and the guy's daughter plays the harp).Barney figures out that he can get anything for himself, if he just says that it is meant for the bride. He wanted a drink, but the bar didn't open till the reception. But, he gets the drink when he says it is for Lily.Much to Lily's disgust, Scooter, her high school boyfriend, shows up at the wedding having been invited by Lily's family (even though Lily did not invite him personally), and then tries desperately but unsuccessfully to win her back. Scooter says that if Lily can look him in the eye and tell him to leave, then he will leave forever. Then Scooter proceeds to ensure that Lily cannot look him in the eye.\nBarney sends Brad to bounce out Scooter and Scooter spends the rest of the ceremony running away from Brad.\nLily also has no flowers for the ceremony, her photographer out of action (Brad tackled the photographer thinking it was Scooter) and replaced with a camera phone (which also belonged to Brad), and her harp player Andrea (Shulie Cowen) is in labor and about to deliver a baby.\nTo top things off, Lily's veil was found ruined (it was found in the parking lot), and Lily thinks that the wedding is just falling apart.Marshall is also having a difficult time, as Lily's cousin Amy (Candice Accola) gave him highlighted tips in his hair, and in an attempt to correct it, he shaves off a patch of hair on his head.\nTed goes to the ceremony and tries to uncle Ben's (Michael Mantell) toupee for Marshall to cover his bald patch. But Uncle Ben refuses to acknowledge that he even wears a toupee. Barney simply grabs the toupee saying the bride needs it.\nBrad has also tackled the caterer by this point.Marshall and Lily then see each other (as they were both out, taking a walk in the park to get some air), and they are about ready to call off the wedding. However, Ted has a plan. Since both Marshall and Lily always wanted a small wedding in a park, Ted suggests since they are outside, hold a small ceremony like they always wanted, and then go perform the ceremony in front of all of their guests.\nWith Barney recently licensed to marry people, all they need is something to cover Marshall's bald patch, which comes in the form of a fedora, which Lily borrows from one of the groundskeepers of the Van Smoot House. The guys had thought of native American headdress, before they thought of a hat.Marshall and Lily are married by Barney, in front of only Ted and Robin (They don't have their vows, and so they say why they love each other). Then, without a worry about how the big ceremony takes place, they go inside, and hold the wedding ceremony in front of the family and all other friends.\nHowever, no one else knows that Marshall and Lily had been married right before. They hold the wedding reception, which carries over into \"Something Blue\".\nThey have their fist sex after marriage in the wedding reception hall bathroom, while Ted was still in there, taking a dump.", "episode_5": "The episode starts with Barney and Lily in a bed, shocked to see each other. Future Ted starts narrating the events that led to that particular moment. Ted and Robin go to Lily's new apartment to bring her a housewarming gift, and they see that the apartment is very small and horrible (the bathroom and the kitchen are basically together.. The stove has a sink, oven and a refrigerator built into it). To top that, she is having to share it with a raccoon. One night, when Lily is preparing to sleep (by pulling down her wall bed), she causes a wall of her apartment to fall down.Meanwhile, Marshall, who is having a hard time coping with being single, starts hanging out with his friend Brad (Joe Manganiello), who is also recently single. Marshall misses being a couple and invites Brad to Brunch, farmers markets and concerts (all things he used to do with Lily). Ted and Robin start making fun of him and point out that they are behaving like a couple in a relationship (he invites Marshall to a Broadway musical of Mamma Mia). Marshall initially ignores them, but later while dining with Brad, he becomes embarrassed after seeing how Brad is treating him. When Ted and Robin learn that Brad has invited him to a wedding in Vermont (at a B&B, and they are sharing a suite), they ridicule him again. Brad wants to go half and half on a gravy boat from Pottery Barn.Lily decides to live temporarily with one of her friends, but Ted cannot let her live with him, since Marshall is living with him now. Robin cannot let her in either, since Lily is allergic to dogs. They ask Barney to let Lily live with him, and Barney refuses outright. Ted succeeds in sneaking Lily into Barney's apartment by giving her a spare key. After some initial reluctance, he agrees to let Lily stay for two days, as long as she doesn't try to change anything.Meanwhile, Marshall goes to meet Brad again. However, when he sees Brad waiting (presumably for him)-with flowers in his hand, he calls Ted for help. Ted and Robin laugh at the situation again and Marshall reluctantly goes to meet Brad. Just then, Brad's ex comes out and Brad tells him that they got back together last night. On learning that the flowers were for Brad's ex, Marshall turns back, somewhat hurt.Here, Barney gives Lily a tour of his apartment, which is full of things to deter women from thinking of him as boyfriend material: a king-size bed with a full-size blanket but just one pillow, a toilet seat which will not remain down, and professionally lit bookshelves of porn. This is a bachelor pad designed to get women to leave as soon as sex is done. However, when his ploys don't act on his latest conquest (She doesn't shower everyday, boycotts coffee and doesn't have a job so she can stay there forever, loves porn), Lily's timely entrance causes the woman to think that Barney is married to her. Barney let's Lily stay in return for scaring off his one night stands by pretending to be his wife.Lily agrees and Barney even lets her decorate his apartment to make it more of a couple. Later, Barney plans to go out, but instead spends the night watching TV with Lily on his bed. The opening scene is played again and it is revealed that Barney and Lily are screaming because they think they had sex last night. Lily realizes that they didn't have sex, but instead dozed off while watching the TV.However, instead of placating Barney, this explanation makes him angry at Lily, since he considers such a night as a sign of being in a monogamous relationship. Barney tells her to leave, and they begin to have a heated argument. Later, it is shown that Lily is back in her old apartment, which she has refurbished with the furniture she had got for Barney. Some time later, while walking on the street, Ted and Marshall run into Brad. Ted and Marshall greet him frostily, as one might an ex, before walking on.", "episode_6": "Lily is having trouble deciding what she wants to do with her life. She tries different careers such as life coach, marine biologist, slam poet, beekeeper, singing in a punk rock band. In the meantime, she is working at a Hawaiian restaurant where she has to wear a coconut bra as her work outfit. Her name is Anuhea (meaning cool and fragrant). She has to bring out a big Hawaiian drum every-time it is a customer's birthday. Ted offers her a job as a secretary at his architectural firm. Lily is put off by Hammond Druthers (Bryan Cranston), Ted's boss, because his designs are phallic.Druthers is full of himself and extremely condescending to Ted and the other employees. Druthers berates Ted's work and compares him to his 6 yr old nephew who plays with Lego. He is assigned to design Styrofoam trees for the building model. Druthers says if Ted doesn't get the trees right, he will be fired. Druthers berates the trees that Ted designs.\nLily learns from Robin that Ted has been working on his own design for the building.\nTo punish Druthers, Lily \"takes away one of his toys\"-she steals his prized baseball \"signed three times by Pete Rose\". Ted finds the baseball in Lily's cabinet. Lily explains to Ted that her own form of justice works well on her kindergarten students (when they are mean to other students, she takes away their favorite toy till they learn their lesson) and that she even used it on a salesperson who was mean to Robin at Gap: she stole a pair of khakis that Robin gave to Ted. Lily calls them Justice Khakis.Ted is horrified, even after Lily reminds Ted of how mean Druthers is (he didn't get his own mother a birthday present, threw a sandwich at the caterer for not having horseradish on roast beef, destroyed the ice cream cone of a young boy just to see him cry). And the next day, after finding the threatening note \"from\" his baseball that Lily left behind (in which Lily has anonymously offered to return the ball if Druthers started to be nice to others), Hammond angrily threatens to start firing people until the thief comes forward. Ted urges Lily to return the ball\nLily thinks that his threats are empty, and tells Ted that she will return the baseball if Ted shows Hammond his re-design of the phallic skyscraper. Ted refuses, firing Lily instead.The next day, the firm's client (a major bank in financial services in Spokane, who wanted a modern skyscraper) turns down Hammond's design because it looks like a penis. In order to keep the client from walking out, Ted presents his own design of the building. Ted's design is approved, and he is credited with probably being the youngest architect to design a building taller than 70 stories. Ted offers Lily her job back, but she tells him that she has realized her true calling is as a kindergarten teacher.Meanwhile, Marshall is upset with a particularly difficult professor Lewis (Jane Seymour) at law school. She rarely gives good grades, and Marshall thinks she is taking her recent divorce out on her students; he mentions off-hand that she \"just needs to get laid\". Lewis is in her 40's. Barney calls her a cougar. A cougar keeps up with current hairstyles as a form of camouflage. It displays maximum cleavage possible to captivate the prey. The claws are long and sharp to ward off rival females.Barney, seeing this as a challenge, decides to help Marshall by seducing the professor, but is thrown for a loop when she gives his sexual performance a grade of C- (He didn't budget his time well, glossed over important points and overall presentation was sloppy & inconclusive). Barney sees her again, and she is still unimpressed (she revised her syllabus for the spring semester). Barney's third attempt resulted in a dislocated hip, but the sex was good enough to get Marshall a B+ on his paper.\nBarney wants to try to get Marshall an A (after 8 weeks of physiotherapy), but Marshall tells Barney to let her go; a cougar belongs in the wild.", "episode_11": "Ted has decided to spend Christmas in his home this year with \"his other family\". He doesn't want to spend it with his mom and her new boyfriend, Clint (Harry Groener); or his dad and his new girlfriend, \"micro-brewing\"; or his super religious cousin, Stacy (Moon Unit Zappa), in Staten Island. While Lily decorates his apartment, Marshall says he must go to the law library to finish one last paper that is due that day. He refuses to look at any of the decorations as he leaves because the \"winter wonderland\" will be his reward for finishing the paper.\nAfter he leaves, Lily finds the old answering machine that was unplugged after Lily and Marshall broke up. Lily plays messages that are still on it, and hears a message from Ted to Marshall telling him to get over Lily. In this message, Ted calls Lily \"a bad word...a very, very bad word\" (implied to be either \"bitch\" or \"cunt\" - based on the fact that Ted has no problem with using a varied pronunciation of the word \"bitch,\" in his stories, it is more likely the latter) which is substituted in future Ted's re-telling of the story with the word \"Grinch.\"Lily asks why Ted would call her that word, and Ted reveals that he was trying to get Marshall to stop idolizing Lily even after they had split during the summer, and told Marshall at the time if he did not stop putting her up on a pedestal, he would never get over her. Ted asks Marshall to tell him one thing wrong with Lily. Finally Marshall gives in and he does (Selfish, would laugh at anything, an artist who sucks at pictionary) and follows with making jokes about Lily along with Ted and Barney at the bar. Ted tells Lily that he was just trying to help Marshall and he refuses to apologize to Lily because she was \"kind of a Grinch\".At the bar, Ted is telling Robin and a progressively ill Barney about what happened, and realizes that he has to apologize to Lily. Ted brings a beer back up to the apartment to offer as an apology. When he opens the door, he finds that Lily has taken all the decorations away from their apartment. Ted wants to make sure the winter wonderland will be there when Marshall gets back from the library. Ted tries to call Lily but with no result. Lily wont bring the decorations back unless Ted apologizes. Lily had left cookies to bake in the oven and they catch fire after Ted forgets to take them out.\nTed gets a call from his mother (calling him Ted Evelyn Mosby), scolding him about the language he used with Lily.As Robin and a very sick Barney stack at the apartment, Ted decides to go to Lily's apartment to apologize. He tricks her into thinking he's the pizza delivery guy so he's able to get her to open the door to her tiny, crappy, cramped NY apartment. He says he's sorry that he called her \"a Grinch\", but Lily works out that he is faking an apology, and is clearly still angry with her. She asks Ted why he won't forgive her when she has already apologized to Marshall. He replies that she never apologized to him, and that her abrupt departure and lack of contact had hurt him as well. He and Lily get into another argument, when her power suddenly goes off, with Lily saying that Ted pissed off the \"big man up stairs,\" her super, that lives above her. He then tells Lily that she can take the decorations back to his and Marshall's apartment because he's going to visit his cousin's family in Staten Island. Marshall comes back home to the apartment, claiming he blew off his paper, but he had been spending hours tracking down his gift for Lily. He finds the winter wonderland intact and no knowledge of what happened earlier in the day.In the meantime, Robin insists upon taking care of Barney, who has caught a terrible cold. He whines about wearing sweatpants, not getting ice cream for dinner, and everything else he can until Robin spikes his tea with codeine.Marshall has brought a package with him, a present for Lily. He tells the story of how he went to the post office to find out why it hadn't come in when it was supposed to. The lady tells him that the package is already on the truck headed to Poughkeepsie. Marshall runs the truck down and asks if he can have the package back. The driver says yes but that he's running behind on his route so Marshall has to ride along. Marshall gets his package, but when the driver tells him that he won't be able to deliver all of the packages in time for Christmas he decides to help out. Lily opens the package to find an Easy-Bake Oven, something she wanted since childhood, but never got because her feminist mom didn't want her to conform to traditional gender roles, and gave her a Lego set instead. Since she has no idea how Marshall knew about her preferred item, he admits learning about it from Ted, whom Lily told her story to back in college. Marshall asks where Ted is and Lily tells him Staten Island.At Ted's cousin's house, Ted is having a miserable time. Lily, Robin, Marshall and Barney arrive with an apology beer for Ted. Ted tells his cousin that it's carolers to keep her from coming to the door. While the other three sing, Lily says she's sick of apologizing and the two agree to skip straight to the forgiveness. Ted takes off after his cousin's children overhear Lily say she \"was kind of a Grinch\", and they all begin to cheer \"Grinch!\" over and over.Back home, Marshall cleans the bowl of leftover cookie dough.", "episode_2": "At MacLaren's, Barney notices Marshall looking at Robin's rear, which makes him and Ted excited as Marshall seems to be getting over Lily. Barney insists on taking Marshall out to meet women.The first time Marshall tries to talk to a woman he fails horribly, talking awkwardly about sweat, and Barney intervenes but ultimately he goes home with the woman. Even though Marshall initially refuses to go out again, Barney convinces him to try again and teaches him his \"Rules of Mating without Dating\".\nAttempting to use one of the rules, Marshall approaches a woman and tries one of Barney's techniques, but quickly admits that he just got out of a long relationship and doesn't know what he is doing. The woman actually finds Marshall's admission charming and the two begin to chat, but Barney introduces himself and then proceeds to take her home.\nBarney convinces Marshall to go out with him again, this time to a college bar near NYU (The Scorpion and the Toad). Marshall does meet a woman, who even gives him her phone number, but in the cab ride home Barney steals the number from Marshall.\nThe following day Barney finds Marshall and tells him that the woman he met at the college bar has a twin sister, and invites him on a double date at MacLaren's. During the double date, however, Barney pulls Marshall aside to tell him that he, Barney, has been propositioned by both twins for a three-way. Upset and frustrated, Marshall leaves the bar.Meanwhile, Lily, recently back from San Francisco, makes contact with Robin, who goes apartment-hunting with her. Robin tells Ted that Lily is back in town and that she seems happy, telling Robin that her art program was amazing (her teacher said that he could not teach her anything) and she loved San Francisco because she met such interesting people (Buddhist monk hunk, a neurosurgeon, and a children's punk band artist).\nTed reacts badly to the news that Lily is so happy, saying that after dumping Marshall she should feel terrible. Robin convinces him not to be mad at Lily for moving on and they join Lily to continue her search for an apartment.\nAfter spending a little time with Lily, Ted tells Robin that he can tell that Lily is miserable and that she is just pretending to be happy. Robin thinks that Lily really is happy with her life, so Ted makes a bet with her for $5, saying that after three tequila shots Lily will tell them the truth about anything.Three tequila shots later, Lily still seems happy and Ted admits that Robin was right, but after Lily receives a call letting her know that someone else got the apartment that she wanted, Lily breaks down and admits that she is miserable without Marshall. She reveals that she lied about her art program-her teacher said that she had no talent-and the \"interesting people\" in San Francisco was actually one guy with a personality disorder.\nShe asks Ted if he thinks Marshall would take her back and Ted says he would, but warns her that she should only contact Marshall if she knows for certain that she wants to reconcile with him.Lily goes to find Marshall and runs into him as he is leaving MacLaren's. Lily apologizes to Marshall, saying that going to San Francisco was the worst mistake that she has ever made, and she asks if they can get back together. Marshall says that when Lily broke up with him she broke his heart, but he has realized that she was right, that he does need to find himself outside of their relationship, and that he doesn't think they should get back together, at least at the moment. Saddened, Lily asks if they will still see each other and Marshall admits that he isn't sure.\nStorming into MacLaren's (at Marshall's request), Lily approaches Barney, still schmoozing the twins, and throws a drink in his face, claiming that he gave her chlamydia. She then returns in a hat, posing as an alleged twin sister, scaring off his dates.", "episode_3": "When Ted's parents, Alfred (Michael Gross) and Virginia (Cristine Rose), come to New York, their visit culminates in a brunch during which everyone is mad at someone else. Lily and Marshall are fighting, Ted is talking to Barney about killing someone, while Robin is telling Virginia to reveal something. Virginia causes a waitress to drop some plates, and Future Ted proceeds to explain events prior to this moment.Marshall and Lily\nFuture Ted explains that his parents never talked about unpleasant, uncomfortable & emotional or in any way real things. Ted's mother invites Lily to dinner that evening, after having invited everyone else, and Lily asks Marshall if he would be uncomfortable if she came. Marshall foolishly says that he and Lily are now like brother and sister; angered, Lily wears a tight, sexy dress to dinner and calls Marshall's attention to her breasts. Marshall gets back at Lily the next day, at brunch, by flaunting his calves. They then have sex in the bathroom, which causes them to begin arguing about who tried to seduce whom.Barney\nBarney is excited to meet Ted's parents for the first time, but is a little put off when Ted says that he has told nothing about Barney to his parents. Turns out Ted only talks to his father about baseball and nothing else. Barney insists he is Ted's best friend, even though Ted slips in that Marshall is his best friend and not Barney.\nAlso, when Robin says that no parent would be comfortable with a person like Barney as their child's friend, Barney goes out of his way to be super nice in front of Ted's parents. He totally eclipses Robin to the extent that Ted's parents don't even notice her. Robin had made reservations at San Marino, but Barney suggested Casa A Pezzi, which serves the best salmon risotto anywhere, which Virginia loves. Robin tells Barney she is Ted's girlfriend and even she is not trying that hard, but Barney says girlfriends are like a flu: out of the system after a couple of weeks in bed.Alfred and Virginia are both charmed by Barney (he plays the piano and asks/tells delightful stories.. He takes Virginia for morning service at the local church), and Alfred even becomes Barney's wing-man for the night (He tells stories about how Barney rescued him from a burning building, while losing his dog in the process). Alfred ends up making out with Wendy the waitress, and Barney shows the photo of Alfred and Wendy (Charlene Amoia) kissing Ted. Ted angrily decides to expose his father at brunch.\nBarney says 83% of the people married more than 6 months have an affair on the side. Ted says Barney always uses 83% in made up statistics.Ted and Robin\nRobin is about to meet Ted's parents for the first time and Ted gives her all necessary pointers. When Virginia approves their decision of taking things slowly (not wanting to get married very soon and all that.. She wants Robin to focus on her career), Robin thinks that Virginia does not like her. Virginia tells her the real reason for her aloofness: she got married too soon and was unhappy in her marriage. She then reveals that she and Alfred have been divorced for some time and have not told Ted. Robin asks her to reveal the secret to all. The focus then goes to the waitress with the broken dishes.When Ted's father calls the waitress at brunch 'sweetheart', Ted confronts his father about kissing Wendy the night before. Ted is surprised at his mother's lukewarm response to the revelation, finally causing both the parents to admit being divorced ten months ago after a two-year separation. They also find out that Ted's father set up his mother with her new boyfriend, Ted's old orthodontist Frank.Ted is dumbfounded, but Robin is happy that Ted's parents like her. Soon, Ted forgives his parents. Virginia says Alfred is a head in the clouds romantic, and she is much more down to earth. They are like Ted and Robin. Virginia didn't want kids, and didn't even want to date Alfred in the beginning. She gave in, only after months of Alfred badgering her. Their story mirrors Ted's and Robin's.Meanwhile, Marshall and Lily apologize to each other for acting so childishly. After brunch, Ted asks his parents about his grandmother, who has not answered his calls; both his parents look uncomfortable and change the subject, leaving Ted shocked again at the implication of her death."}, "season_6": {"episode_4": "While the gang hangs out at MacLaren's, Marshall learns that his friend Max (Geoff Stults) from law school has just spotted Woody Allen at a restaurant downtown. While Robin is interested in seeing him, the rest of the gang is not, saying they have seen him plenty of times and teasing Robin about not being a \"real\" New Yorker, as she's from Canada. Robin tries to impress them by saying she has seen Maury Povich, but the gang is again unimpressed, as they have all seen him many times as well. The group debates what it takes to become a real New Yorker; Ted states it's stealing a cab from someone who really needs one, Lily argues it's crying on the subway and not caring what others think, while Marshall states it's killing a cockroach with one's bare hands.\nRobin admits that she has not done any of those things, but Future Ted states that by the end of the day, she would have done all three. The group then begins arguing on what the fastest way to get to the restaurant would be, and quickly decide to race each other there: Ted rides the bus, Lily takes the subway, Robin opts to hail a cab, Marshall decides to run there on foot, and Barney claims to have the fastest method of all while even enjoying a steak first.Barney's plan is revealed to be faking a heart attack at a restaurant after eating the steak, then using the ambulance ride to a hospital right next to the restaurant as his quick transportation. His plan backfires, however, when the ambulance takes him to a hospital uptown, and he is forced to contact Ranjit (Marshall Manesh) for a ride. Meanwhile, Lily misinterprets the subway conductor's announcement that the subway is undergoing maintenance, and soon after exiting the train, it departs.Robin hails a cab, stealing it from a woman carrying bags who then angrily leaps on top of the windshield. Robin and the cab driver are freaked out, so Robin abandons the ride, and later rides along with Barney in Ranjit's car. During the ride, Robin angrily reveals to Barney that she had tried to talk to him about how low she was feeling recently (due to her break-up with Don and feeling shunned and forgotten due to her overly-enthusiastic new co-anchor Becky (Laura Bell Bundy)), yet he ignored her and tried to use her as a decoy while he eyed up a woman at the bar. Barney realizes what he did and tells Robin he's listening now, but she is not interested and leaves the car.Ted rides the bus, and attempts to impress others riding with his knowledge of New York architecture, though he mainly bores and annoys them. Marshall is at first enthusiastic and confident that he can outrun everyone, though he soon begins to lose energy.Future Ted discusses why each of them personally felt the need to win the race. Lily had been feeling dejected after having been unable to conceive a baby with Marshall for two months, Marshall was feeling the same, believing it to be his fault, Ted had been stunned after receiving a negative review on a teacher rating website (despite having received many positive ones), Robin was feeling bad after the terrible year she'd had, while Barney really did not have a reason to win.Halfway through the race, the group all coincidentally meet up, and though Ted proposes they declare a tie, they immediately continue the race. Robin takes the subway, where she sees a poster up for her news show, with her co-anchor's face taking up much more space then hers. Enraged, Robin rips it down, only to see an older poster behind it with one of her and Don. Robin breaks down crying, snapping at the other passengers when they look in her direction. Lily spots her and comforts her, though she quickly abandons her and calls Ranjit in favor of the race. Barney rides a pedicab, though he quickly changes places with the driver to bike there himself.Lily has Ranjit pick up Marshall on the way, and the two discuss their concerns about not conceiving a baby yet. They then agree there is really no rush to become parents, and promptly decide to head to Coney Island to have fun. Ted, Barney, and Robin race for the finish; however, Barney trips, taking Ted down with him and allowing Robin to win the race. Future Ted tells his kids that, while Barney constantly denied it, he knew that Barney had spotted that Robin had been crying earlier, and purposefully tripped Ted and himself so Robin could win. Robin enjoys a meal with Max while Ted thanks Barney for letting Robin win. Max points out Woody Allen to Robin, who in fact turns out to be Maury Povich (the group had inexplicably seen him several times throughout the episode), although Future Ted states that Robin did see Woody Allen a couple of months later. Robin then kills a cockroach on the table with her hand, thus fulfilling all three tasks to become a real New Yorker.", "episode_9": "Barney wears a boutonniere and claims that there is an 83% chance for a man to wear a flower on their jacket and having sex.

She accompanies Barney to his apartment and feeds him soup, cleans his sinuses, and plays a violin to put him to sleep.When Barney visits the cardiologist, she requests that he wears a heart monitor for 24 hours, citing a possible arrhythmia.

She asks Barney what happened at these certain times, and Barney tells the story of the last 24 hours.At dinner the previous night, Barney became worried when Nora began talking about marriage and settling down; he claims he wants the same things.

As he takes his first bite, however, he sees Barney nearby and slowly walks away in embarrassment.", "episode_8": "Ted and the gang are invited to a gala party at the Natural History Museum thrown by George van Smoot, also known as \"The Captain\". While hobnobbing, Ted sees Zoey, with whom he is angry for writing a column criticizing his work at GNB regarding the Arcadian, describing the project as \"taking away from the have-not, giving to the haves\". Ted is especially angry due to the column's position in the paper being next to his weekly crossword.At the party, Zoey introduces Ted to her husband, the Captain (Kyle MacLachlan), a wealthy, much older man who is obsessed with boats. Ted names himself Galactic President Superstar McAwesomeville, since George claims to have named himself Captain.\nLater, Ted corners Zoey and berates her for the hypocrisy of her column and trying to ruin his career, angrily calling her a \"bored trophy wife\". At this, Zoey starts crying and tells Ted that she is unhappy in her marriage.\nTed immediately feels sorry for her, and he tries to commiserate with her by ranting against GNB and their obnoxious work culture. Zoey's tears are a ruse, however: She had been recording the entire conversation, and then promises Ted that his remarks will be given prime space in the next day's newspaper. The Captain hears about the situation and sympathizes with Ted, because he had also fallen victim of Zoey's recorder; Ted replies that even though she betrayed his trust, he respects her activism. The Captain promises to erase Ted's recording because he is impressed by him. Because of the acoustic capabilities of the museum, Zoey overhears their conversation; she breaks into real tears and promises Ted she will erase the conversation herself, resolving to play fair from now on.Meanwhile, Barney goes on the prowl in the museum, pulling off pranks using various exhibits along with Robin. Barney brags about having knocked down the blue whale exhibit as a child, which none of the gang believe. Robin takes up Barney as they engage in a series of escalating pranks across the museum exhibits.\nAfter catching Robin by surprise disguised as an Egyptian pharaoh, a security guard catches them in the act and brings them to the security office. Robin's skepticism about the blue whale incident prompts the security officer to check old records. One file, dated July 23, 1981, recounts the incident in full, but a check of the document reveals that Barney's guardian that day, Jerome Whittaker-who he believed as a child to be his \"Uncle Jerry\"-identified himself as Barney's father on the visitor form. He asks Robin not to mention the discovery to the others.Marshall tells Lily that GNB has offered him a five-year contract. Lily, however, is still firm on her belief that Marshall will resign and pursue his dream of being an environmental lawyer. Lily also realizes that whenever she had asked Marshall about whether he would quit his job at GNB, he always responded with made-up words so that he could not be held culpable as a liar. In the ensuing argument, Marshall insists on staying in the company for financial reasons, and Lily storms out; she feels he hasn't stayed true to himself and their values. While in another part of the museum, Lily visualizes an exhibit showing extinct \"College Marshall\" at their old Wesleyan dorm. She talks with College Marshall, telling him that his persona was the one she fell in love with many years ago and \"Corporate\" Marshall embodied everything he despised. However, College Marshall tells her that while Corporate Marshall may have changed in a few ways, he hasn't changed where it counts. Just then, the real Marshall appears and promises to work harder to provide a stable future for their family. Future Ted later reveals that Marshall does leave GNB in the future (with the camera pulling back to reveal an exhibit showing extinct Corporate Marshall), but the episode ends with Future Ted just saying, \"but that's another story\".", "episode_11": "Marshall and Robin realize they've never really spent much time alone and decide to go out to dinner together. The dinner turns out be awkward, to which they agree it's because they don't spend much time together outside of the group. Marshall then explains Barney's \"Mermaid Theory\": Long ago, sailors used to picture manatees as mermaids due to long periods without female contact (the vision is shown with Barney and Marshall as sailors).\nAfter hiring an unappealing female assistant two years ago, Barney had told Marshall that though Marshall views her as a \"manatee\" now, as he spent more time with her, she would eventually become a \"mermaid\" in his eyes. Barney says the \"mermaid clock\" is ticking, and over a year later, his assistant does in fact seem like a mermaid to Marshall, much to his horror.\nMarshall tells Robin he doesn't want her to turn into a mermaid out of respect for Lily, though he explains a woman can go back to being a manatee by becoming pregnant. The two eventually have a good time by getting drunk, though when they return to the apartment, Marshall begins seeing Robin as a mermaid. When she throws up all over the floor, however, Marshall once again sees her as a manatee, much to his relief.Soon after Marshall and Robin had agreed to hang out, Barney had asked Lily the same, who refused, offending Barney. However, Future Ted has trouble recalling what exactly the argument was, and only after explaining the mermaid theory does he remember the actual story. This event had in fact taken place farther in the future, while Lily was pregnant. Lily had refused because she thought Barney would picture her naked, though when Barney says he views her as a manatee now that she's pregnant, she becomes angry.\nLater, the two make up when Barney says Lily can become a mermaid again when she begins breastfeeding. Ted then walks in wearing a green dress, stating \"Now we're even!\" though Future Ted says that's a story for another time.Future Ted explains Zoey has since become a normal acquaintance among the group, although Ted and the gang are secretly terrified of Zoey's husband, \"the Captain\". Ted tells the group Zoey has invited them to an art gala, though when only Ted expresses interest, Lily cautions Ted on hanging out with Zoey alone. Lily says that there are rules about hanging out with a married woman. Don't go anywhere near candles, no sharing food and no lying to the spouse about anything.\nTed promises nothing will happen, though while the two are together, Zoey lies to her husband when he calls by saying she is \"out with friends\" instead of specifically mentioning Ted.Zoey tells Ted not to worry about it, but when he tells Lily later, she becomes worried. Lily then says if Ted can become friendly with the Captain, it can straighten things out.\nZoey invites Ted to come on their boat one evening, though it turns out to only be with the Captain. Due to the Captain's seemingly sinister undertones, Ted suspects the Captain knows he's been hanging out with Zoey and fears he will be murdered.\nWhile the Captain heads below deck to get something, Ted prepares to jump from the boat, but finds his fears were for nothing as the Captain returns with drinks. However, the boat hits a bump and Ted falls in the water. After being brought back on the boat, Ted admits his fears, though the Captain tells him he's glad Zoey has found a new friend and expresses his interest to be friends as well, to which Ted accepts.\nTed later tells Zoey he really does think of the Captain as a nice guy, but hopes he and Zoey can continue to be friends. Ted decides they shouldn't hang out if either begins to develop feelings for the other; while both deny any such notion, a ticking clock is heard in the background, indicating the mermaid clock has begun.In the end, the sailor story is extended, with sailor Marshall lamenting about not finding land yet. He then begins to envision Barney as a mermaid, to which he affirms they really need to find land.", "episode_13": "Future Ted tells his kids that Marshall and Lily are anxious and worried about their chances of having a baby. After several months of trying to conceive without success, their doctor refers them to a fertility expert. As they tell Ted the news at MacLaren's, Barney arrives and announces to Ted and Marshall's dismay that he needs a partner for a laser tag tournament.Lily goes to her appointment with the fertility expert, Dr. John Stangel (Neil Patrick Harris), only to discover that he looks exactly like Barney, save for a beard and dark brown hair, raising her immediate concern that he is in fact Barney in disguise. When Lily confronts Barney, Marshall vouches for Barney, saying that they spent the whole day together.\nTo convince her that Stangel and Barney are not the same person, Marshall attends Lily's appointment and also immediately assumes Stangel and Barney are the same person. Barney shows up, acknowledges the similarity, and leaves. Lily still thinks Dr. Stangel is Barney in disguise upon hearing him say \"Scoot up\", mistaking it for Barney's catch phrase of \"Suit up.\" After getting Barney and the doctor in the room together throughout the procedure, Lily is convinced that they are in fact two different people.When Lily's tests reveal that she is extremely fertile, Marshall is about to call his father with the good news, but stops when he considers that his sperm may be the problem. He admits only talking about good news with his father and decides to get his sperm tested before calling him again. When Marshall is unable to produce a sperm sample at the doctor's office, he returns home to produce the sample, only to find that his parents have dropped by for a surprise visit. He eventually reveals to his parents his concerns about possible infertility, to which they reassure him that they love him regardless of whether he and Lily will give them grandchildren and suggest other options, such as adoption and sperm donors.Meanwhile, Robin's new job at World Wide News has started badly, beginning with the revelation that the network's lead anchor is her old Metro News 1 colleague Sandy Rivers (Alexis Denisof). He promptly tells the entire office that they had sex and continues to harass her in front of her new co-workers with increasingly embarrassing stories from Robin's past. The group tells Robin to play along with the mockery, insisting that it will only get worse if she resists it. However, after an especially humiliating day, Ted decides to help Robin by confronting Sandy at his apartment.\nTed learns that Sandy is bald and wears a toupee; he snaps a picture, and tells Robin to use it to put him to shame. At work the following day, Sandy takes another shot at Robin. Instead of showing the office the picture of him, however, she pulls out her old Robin Sparkles denim jacket, embracing the mockery and moving on (with Future Ted telling his kids that while Robin never shook off the nickname of 'Sparkles', she went on to do great things while working for World Wide News).Having spent the entire day anticipating bad news, Marshall receives good news about his fertility from Stangel (after a failed impersonation by Barney attempting to trick Marshall into becoming his laser tag partner). While at MacLaren's, he tries to call his father about his good news, but Mr. Eriksen does not pick up the phone. At that moment, Lily pulls up in a taxi and tearfully informs Marshall that his father has been rushed to hospital after having a heart attack, and that he did not survive. Shocked and grief-stricken, Marshall embraces Lily, and begins to weep, repeating the words, \"I'm not ready for this.\"", "episode_21": "The episode starts with Barney and his father, Jerry, parting in 1983. Jerry last words before he left were \"Never top partying\" and this became Barney's motto for life.\nBack in the present, Barney is disappointed in Jerry's normal suburban lifestyle, and decides not to pursue any further contact. However, Barney is surprised by a call from Jerry, who invites Barney to go fishing with him and his son JJ. Barney declines and tells the gang he resolves to take his dad out to lead him back to his old \"party hard\" lifestyle.\nHe creates alternate identities for the group so as to impress Jerry: Marshall is a playwright in an open marriage with Lily, while Robin and Ted are dating. Robin is a professional scotch taster.The next night, the group meets Jerry at MacLaren's where, after a brief discussion on which club to head to, they decide on one called Hopeless. Jerry is reluctant to get drunk, as he is going fishing with JJ the next day, but finally agrees and begins downing several shots. Jerry and Barney begin having a great time, eventually roaming the streets of New York and pulling various pranks, such as picking a fight with a heavyset biker and yanking out a parking meter.Meanwhile, Marshall and Lily make a bet to see who can pick up five numbers from people at the club the fastest, with either winner getting to have sex in the bathroom. Lily ends up winning, though Marshall claims to have \"won the race\" of the prize.\nRobin runs into an old crush of hers at the club; before she has a chance to ask him out, Ted claims to be dating her, to keep up the ruse for Jerry.\nRobin had met the man several years before at a clothing store; Ted realizes he and Robin had been dating at the time, and promptly decides to announce to everyone in the club that he and Robin are to get married, thus ruining any chance Robin has with the man.\nRobin points out Ted had bought his red cowboy boots that day because another woman had told him he would look good in them, and tells him to get off his high horse.\nAs Marshall, Lily, Ted and Robin are heading home, Lily says that she is sorry that Robin's secret crush didn't work out. Robin replies that it is okay, and maybe it wasn't meant to be. Lily asks her why she is smiling, and she says she doesn't know. Just as Robin and Ted are entering their building, Robin's crush passes by and is talking to someone on his cell phone saying that he met \"that\" girl again and that she is engaged to Ted. Future Ted hints there would be more between them later.Barney and Jerry are eventually arrested after Jerry throws up on a police car. As they sit handcuffed on the curb, Jerry reveals that he was in fact never drunk, having only pretended to take the shots, while the various pranks really didn't happen (due to Barney's drunkenness, he couldn't tell Jerry was pretending, and it was Barney who had thrown up.)\nJerry wanted to hang out with Barney while at the same time showing him, he can't keep partying forever. However, because Jerry is also an aspiring magician, like Barney, they manage to free themselves from the handcuffs, and head back to Jerry's house (getting a ride with one of Jerry's driving students) so that he can make it on time for the fishing trip.\nOn the ride back, Barney asks Jerry how he managed to settle down and live a \"normal\" life and confides that someday he too wishes to settle down. Jerry tells him he won't reveal his secret but says he must first meet the right girl. Barney says that maybe he has already met the right girl.Although he declines at first, when Jerry produces a memento from their last day together when Barney was a kid and expresses how much it meant to him over the intervening years, Barney decides to go fishing with Jerry and his son, though later on the boat (wearing on his suit's lapel the \"Legalize It\" button Jerry had held onto all those years) he sighs and says, \"This sucks!\"", "episode_16": "When Lily mentions how lonely she is with Marshall still living with his mother in Minnesota, Barney explains the story of Desperation Day, the day before Valentine's Day. Barney claims that single women will find themselves desperate and easy to hook up with on the eve of Valentine's Day. Robin decides to prove him wrong and says she will be hanging out with her female colleagues that night, though Barney believes they will be just as desperate as any other woman.That night, Robin hangs out with her colleagues, while Barney hits on women. However, Barney then takes interest in one of Robin's colleagues, Nora (Nazanin Boniadi), who had just arrived. Nora privately tells Barney that unlike Robin and her other colleagues, she actually loves Valentine's Day. Barney hints that the fact she tries to appear romantic comes across as desperate, and instead begins explaining how to play laser tag.\nThe two return to Robin to find her friends have left, as they had gone home with two other guys. Nora soon leaves as well, to Barney's disappointment, but gloats to Robin how her colleagues had fallen for Desperation Day. Robin however points out its after midnight, and Barney had failed to hook up with a woman on Desperation Day. She also claims Barney is beginning to like Nora; though he denies it, Robin later invites Nora to play laser tag with Barney. Future Ted states it was the first time Barney had been on a date on Valentine's Day.After confessing their feelings for each other in the past episode, Ted and Zoey are happily dating though they agree to take things slow. Zoey invites Ted to help bake cookies one night; when Ted describes this is as odd to the rest of the gang, they tell him \"baking cookies\" is essentially code for staying over for the night. Ted arrives at Zoey's apartment with an overnight bag, but she sends him home, saying he was being presumptuous. Later Zoey apologizes and tells Ted she is ready to get serious and agrees to spend Valentine's day with Ted at his apartment. However, Ted feels there is added pressure, as Zoey has just separated from her husband, and begins feeling anxious. Ted also drives all the way to Minnesota to be with Marshall and avoid being with Zoey on Valentine's day.Meanwhile, Lily misses Marshall, and is especially disappointed as it is Valentine's Day; the couple has an odd tradition of watching Predator every year on February 14. After admitting to have used a stuffed pillow as a stand-in to Marshall, Lily finally heads to Marshall's home to convince him to return. Marshall doesn't wish to leave so soon, but it becomes clear Marshall's mother has become annoyed with his presence, though not admitting it to Marshall.\nMarshall has essentially reverted to his teenage self, playing his old video games and not even realizing how much Lily misses him or his mother's annoyance of him. Ted soon joins Marshall, claiming to help Marshall deal with his loss though in reality trying to avoid the pressure of committing to a relationship with Zoey.Lily finally announces that she is heading back home to New York, leaving Marshall saddened. Marshall reveals to Ted the real reason he has stayed in Minnesota is because he feels lost without his dad, and doesn't wish to return to his life. The two agree to drive back home that night, as flights have been canceled due to a storm. During the drive, Marshall has trouble seeing the road ahead when the image of his late father appears in his back seat, giving him advice on how he drove in such conditions. Encouraged by his father's words, Marshall makes it back to New York. Lily is later thrilled when Marshall comes home, and the two watch Predator together.Zoey later greets Ted at his apartment and shows him her own overnight bag. Ted jokingly calls her presumptuous, and the two kiss, thus ending their anxieties about commitment. In the end, Lily is shown having a quiet break-up with her pillow (which she had nicknamed \"Marshpillow\").", "episode_6": "Marshall and Lily visit Stuart (Matt Boren) and Claudia (Virginia Williams), who are having trouble naming their newborn baby. Marshall comes up with boy names that Lily rejects because of her past experiences with trouble-making kindergarten boys (with Honka Honka, one boy Ryan stabbing her in the thighs with a pencil, one boy Johnny eating the Goldfish, or Jeremy who splashed paint all over Lily during the art class) and Lily comes up girl names that Marshall rejects because of his experience with a hot girl back in his high school (Tara) and a stripper (named Esther).\nA future fantasy has an older Barney hitting on and subsequently marrying their daughter. Marshall, worried that it might be a girl, consults his father on how to ensure that it will be a boy (Avoid lemons. Eat pickled herring, dunk the junk in a big bowl of ice right before sex, and point the girl due north while having sex) while Lily has been searching for ways to make sure it will be a girl (eat lemons, point south during sex and heat up the lady parts to 105 degrees).\nWhen they found out, they realize that they have no control over the gender and decide to give him/her the gender-neutral name Jamie. Lily rejects the name later because of a troublemaker named Jamie.Robin wants Ted to watch her show to validate how annoying Becky really is. But Ted watches the show and finds Becky charming. Robin cannot understand why the little girl act works on all men.\nBecky, Robin's new, overly cheery co-anchor at Come On, Get Up New York! reveals that she is dating Ted. Ted claims that Becky came over to meet Robin which a batch of chocolate chip cookies and then got all scared by a few spiders on the floor. Ted smashed the spider and saw himself as all manly.\nRobin takes issue with Ted dating a girl who uses baby talk, while Ted, Barney, and Marshall defend girls using baby talk as a way for men to feel more manly and protective.Robin states that women would never fly with a man using baby talk. Barney accepts the challenge but tries and fails the baby talk play. He strikes out with every woman at the bar and gives up.\nRobin finds out that Ted finds dependent girls attractive and found Robin's independence and assertiveness off-putting. Robin asks Barney if he felt that he was needed by Robin during their relationship, but he thought her independence was awesome.\nRobin points out that there is a crazy woman in his apartment-she turns out to have come by Barney as he was indulging himself in ice cream and responding to him in a childish manner (Barney refuses to share his ice cream in a childish manner and the woman also responds like a little girl), seduced Barney.\nBarney asks for Robin's help to get rid of the woman, and the independent Robin grabs Barney's decorative sword and heads into the bedroom.Ted and Becky are in a park, and as Becky licks an ice cream cone, Ted notices her shoe is untied and bends down to tie it. He then notices a nearby father tying his daughter's shoe and breaks up with Becky.", "episode_10": "It's the day before Thanksgiving, and Ted is hosting his first Thanksgiving for the group, and tries his best to make it memorable. He makes a special turkey by stuffing it with a smaller turkey, calling it a \"turturkeykey\". Just as he is about to call it an early night, the group tells him not to leave the bar, or he will get the curse of \"The Blitz\". Future Ted explains how an old college friend, Steve Henry (Jorge Garcia), had the curse of The Blitz; whenever he would leave the room with a group, something amazing would happen, leaving Steve saddened that he had missed out on it. The curse of The Blitz originally began with Matt Blitz in the 1960s and was passed on through other people over the years to Steve. Ted scoffs at the curse and leaves.The next morning, Ted awakens to find his apartment a wreck. The gang are all present (even Steve Henry) and Ted discovers Zoey sleeping in the bathtub, who leaves soon afterward. Ted is furious that the group spent time with his mortal enemy. Lily explains that Zoey entered MacLaren's after Ted left. The group originally schemed to get back at her for everything she did to Ted, but end up having a great night with her and Steve.\nTed realizes he truly has been cursed with The Blitz. The rest tell him about the night: Marshall sent a photo of his genitals to a complete stranger (nicknamed \"Wang Guy\"), Robin danced on the door of Ted's oven (breaking it off in the process), Lily had glided on the floor using Ted's butter, and a game called \"The Gentleman\" was played, which involved flipping a top hat onto someone's head.\nSince Ted's oven is broken, the gang and Steve seek a place where they could cook the \"turkey\", but rule out Barney's place because he doesn't really have a stove (just a cardboard display), Marshall and Lily's place because of the foul stench from the sewage plant, and Steve's house because cats crowd the stove.\nLily then remembers that Zoey invited them all to her place for Thanksgiving, as her husband (The Captain) is spending Thanksgiving with his daughter. Ted is reluctant, but agrees to go to her place. Meanwhile, Barney hitches a separate cab to Zoey's, as he was tired of being stuck in the crowded cab, but then realizes he may have been cursed with The Blitz by being away from the group.\nBarney meets the group outside Zoey's apartment and he realizes that he has become The Blitz, as the group says they had run into a Thanksgiving Day parade (Steve tests this later by having Barney leave the room temporarily; he flips a coin which lands perfectly on its end, but by the time Barney returns, the coin falls flat). At Zoey's, Marshall exclaims that Wang Guy sent him a picture of his genitals back.Ted is not ready to hang out with Zoey, but Lily says that enemies can become friends. Ted decides to see if this can happen and heads back to the kitchen, only to run into Zoey, spilling cranberry sauce and ruining her sweater. Zoey & Ted start fighting, and Lily tries to stop them by referring to feuding cartoon characters, causing Ted to compare Zoey to Cinderella's evil stepmother. Unexpectedly, Zoey is profoundly hurt by this comment and orders them to leave.While heading back, Ted sees Lily stole a present from Zoey's apartment, which Zoey was planning to give to someone named Hannah. Ted, remembering an earlier comment Zoey made about the Captain's daughter and the pain his \"evil stepmother\" comment caused, surmises that Hannah is Zoey's step-daughter, and realizes that Zoey is saddened by the fact that Hannah avoids spending time with her on the holidays (which also leaves Zoey alone every time, as the Captain chooses to spend those days with his daughter).\nTed and the group head back to the apartment. Barney is too busy sulking about the curse to see they had left, and then doesn't even notice that Zoey had been walking around half-naked. Ted asks for Zoey's forgiveness, saying that he understands her feelings for Hannah, and as the group enjoys a Thanksgiving meal, Future Ted says it's how he and Zoey finally became friends.Marshall takes a picture of the group to send to Wang Guy, with Robin showing some interest in the unknown person after seeing the picture of his genitals. The curse of The Blitz strikes Barney again, even with him in the room, in which a chain reaction of toppling objects causes a top hat to fly through the air and land on Ted's \"turkey\" (creating \"The Gentleman\"), with Barney missing it all as he was momentarily distracted (Future Ted also points out that the \"turkey\" tasted \"wrong\").After the dinner, Barney & Steve head towards the elevator. Steve remembers that he forgot his jacket and turns to retrieve it. Just then, a girl from the neighboring apartment darts into the elevator, with Barney inside. As the door closes, the dress gets stuck between the doors, and rips apart. Steve just hears her scream, Barney saying \"Thank You God!!\", and Steve realizes that he has been \"Blitzed\" again.", "episode_23": "Marshall presents his case for preserving the Arcadian at a meeting of the Landmark Preservation Commission (LPC), where the fate of the Arcadian would be decided once and for all. When Ted is called up to present his opinion, Future Ted explains how difficult it was for him to come to his decision.Ever since Zoey had explained how she had grown up in the Arcadian, Ted had sided with her, hoping to keep their relationship strong. Barney remains estranged from the group, since both Marshall and Ted are in support of the Arcadian's preservation. Barney theorizes that the only reason Ted had sided with Zoey is because she has magic lady bits.\nHowever, Barney learns from his boss Arthur that not only will Ted be fired if the project doesn't go through, but Barney will also be fired for having suggested Ted as the architect in the first place.\nWhen Ted hears of this, he refuses to budge, but Robin explains that no matter what happens to the Arcadian, his relationship with Zoey will end badly: if the Arcadian is not accepted as a landmark, Zoey will feel betrayed and leave him, while if it stays, Ted will blame Zoey for spoiling his own dreams, apart from Barney's job. But strangely, nobody in the group really knows what Barney does at the GNB.\nTed still wants to keep the Arcadian and try to make it work with Zoey, but Ted later has a dream with Barney dressed up as the original architect of the Arcadian. He convinces Ted that the Arcadian must go, as being able to design a building in New York would undoubtedly help his career and future.\nTed calls Zoey to gaze upon the building one last time, though he doesn't tell her what he plans to say the next day at the LPC meeting.Ted ultimately says he does not wish for the Arcadian to be preserved.\nThis prompts Zoey to present voice recordings of Ted from \"Natural History\", saying how he was in support of the Arcadian's preservation, particularly mentioning its ornate stonework of a lion head.\nWith the LPC poised to give a decision the next morning, Ted is saddened to realize they will surely vote to preserve the Arcadian, thus causing him and Barney to lose their jobs. The gang decides that the only way forward is to buy a bar with a courtroom theme.\nHowever, Lily comes up with a plan to possibly keep Ted's relationship alive while having the Arcadian demolished.\nThey go to Arthur to explain their plan, but Future Ted says that he can't mention the specifics for legal reasons.\nThe next day, the LPC explain they originally planned to destroy the Arcadian but Ted's description of the Lion Head Stonework meant they would instead preserve the Arcadian.However, they reveal the lion head had vanished the night before (the group got two construction workers to remove it), thus prompting them to ultimately decide not to preserve the Arcadian. Ted had hoped that Zoey would remain with him if it seemed the decision to demolish the Arcadian had not come from him; however, Zoey ends up leaving him anyway.With his relationship with Zoey over, Ted calls Barney so Barney can complain about Zoey, when it's revealed that Barney kept the lion head in his room.", "episode_20": "Ted and the others realize how much he and Zoey argue, a polar opposite of Lily and Marshall's relationship, where the two always seem to be in support of each other. Ted and Lily argue throughout the episode about whose relationship is better. Ted says that Zoey challenges him to grow beyond his traditional ways of thinking and he likes that. But in reality, they don't agree on anything, not even who hangs up the phone first, or which movie to watch.\nHowever, Ted begins to feel Lily is right and is growing tired of his constant feuding with Zoey; he is also especially annoyed that Zoey had requested the Arcadian be listed as a landmark, which could scrap his entire project if accepted.\nWhen Ted argues again with Zoey about his dream to build a skyscraper in New York, he begins thinking he needs to break up with her. However, Ted realizes he has grown fond of their arguing (\"graduation goggles\", which means that you love even the bullies after high school is over and you forget all the terrible things they did to you), and instead kisses her.\nFuture Ted muses on which type of relationship is better, but promptly decides a supportive one is best, a fact his younger self would have to learn the hard way.Marshall has been growing increasingly displeased with his job at GNB, and is considering quitting to get a job with the Natural Resources Defense Council. Marshall hates the paperwork at GNB, the coffee, the dirty jokes, and even the old farts that he works for.\nLily assures him that he has her full support no matter what, despite Barney pointing out Marshall's new job would pay considerably less.\nLily's resolve is tested, however, when Marshall quits GNB and begins work at the NRDC, but only in a volunteer capacity. Marshall later offers his home to host an NRDC fundraiser, and Lily takes Ted to pick up a guest from the airport. When they arrive, however, Lily reveals she is fed up with Marshall's plans, and worried that their future may be in jeopardy due to the lack of income. She tells Ted that she is tired of being supportive all the time.\nShe promptly leaves to head to Spain, a trip she had been hoping to take with Marshall, but one that now seems impossible.\nLater, at the fundraiser, Ted attempts to tell Marshall about Lily, but she makes a surprise return and assures Marshall again that he has her support. When Ted glances skeptically at her, Lily breaks down and reveals her doubts, but Marshall thanks Lily for her support and states that he will begin looking for another job with pay.Upon hearing Marshall's decision to quit GNB, Barney is considerably shaken, prompting Robin to wonder if it is because of Barney's recent estrangement from his father. After Robin witnesses Barney tearing up his office (after Marshall turned down a lunch invitation from Barney), the two finally talk about it. Barney explains the real reason: some time ago, Marshall had pointed out some marinara sauce on Barney's suit while eating a meatball sub. Extremely irked by this comment, Barney spent months plotting his revenge, designing an exploding meatball sub to give to Marshall. Marshall had quit on the day Barney had planned to have Marshall receive the sub, denying him his chance at revenge.In the end, ten years later, Barney is shown apparently on his death bed, with his grieving friends beside him. Barney tells Marshall to eat a meatball sub as his last request; the sub promptly explodes in Marshall's face, and Barney reveals he isn't actually sick, rejoicing at having finally taken his revenge. When Ted points out some marinara sauce on Barney's clothes, Barney begins eyeing Ted in the same vengeful way he had with Marshall.", "episode_2": "Barney is with the gang at MacLaren's Pub telling another story of romantic conquest when he suddenly breaks down in tears. He explains that his mother is moving out of his childhood home and is selling it.\nTed feels him as he has also been banished from his childhood home ever since his mom Virginia (Cristine Rose) married Clint (Harry Groener). They converted his old room into a Tantric sex temple.\nBarney then tells the gang that they will be helping him move it all over the next two days. Despite their protests, they show up, meeting Barney's mother, Loretta Stinson (Frances Conroy), and his brother, James (Wayne Brady) at their house in Staten Island. James has adopted a son with his gay life partner.While the gang goes through Barney's childhood room, they find evidence of a lonely childhood, which was all covered up by Loretta's elaborate lies like when she said Bob Barker was his father. Barney was kicked off the basketball team as he was not a good player, but Loretta told him that Barney was so awesome that it was unfair to the other kids. No one showed up to his 8th birthday party and Loretta made up a letter from the Postmaster general, apologizing for losing his invitations that were sent via mail.\nBarney seems to accept these delusions at face value until he and his brother find an non-posted letter to a \"Sam Gibbs\", with a photo of the two of them, with the words \"your son\" on the back.\nWhen confronted Loretta makes up a lame story about the photo being taken in a place called Yourson North Dakota, where the boys had rescued the Mayor Sam Gibbs's dog who had wandered into the rapids. She was sending the photo to the mayor who wanted to make statues for the boys. But James finds the lie, as their old swing set is clearly visible in the background of the photo.The gang immediately heads over to the address. Barney admits that he knows that Bob Barker is not actually his father and that he's ready to face the truth. An elder colored man answers the door. James realizes that Sam (Ben Vereen) is his father, and the two embrace, crying. Barney then joins the hug, under the impression that this man is his father as well. He then proceeds to feed into the idea that he is African American, even interrupting Sam (Ben Vereen) and James' beautiful duet of Stand by Me.Back at his mother's house, Barney sits in his room with Loretta who gives him a note to the identity of his real father. While they talk, Barney puts together all the work his mother did for him as a child, tears up the note and realizes that she's all the father he'll ever need.Meanwhile, Robin tells Ted that she has been promoting him to a hot makeup artist at work named Liz, but when she describes her selling points (funny, handsome, incredible lover, endless waves of pleasure just cresting and breaking for hours & hours, passed out from orgasms), Ted is worried that she oversold him. He says that Robin should have undersell him, so he could blow her frigging mind.Over the course of the day, she sends a series of text messages to try to balance out this faux pas. Near the end of the episode, Robin receives a text from the woman which says she is still interested in meeting Ted.\nTed then realizes that Robin has oversold the woman to him as well.", "episode_22": "In the cold opening, Future Ted narrates that on the day Marshall resigned from GNB, his boss Arthur Hobbs asked to be put as his character reference when applying for a new job at an environmental organization. However, the organization rejects his application, revealing that Hobbs gave them negative feedback by recalling his supposed lack of professionalism (showing up for work at 2:30 PM, not adhering to the dress code, not wearing pants in front of female co-workers) and stories about his disdain for the environment (including clubbing a seal with an even cuter seal). Marshall returns to GNB to confront Hobbs and runs into Zoey, who offers him a job as her group's lawyer.At MacLaren's, Barney hands out invitations to the Arcadian's demolition. Zoey comes over and introduces Marshall as her lawyer, which upsets Barney because he helped Marshall land a job at GNB in the first place. Zoey knows that having an ex-GNB employee on their side would be huge for their cause.\nHe launches a prank war against Marshall by doing questionable disgusting things to anything Marshall's mouth touches and sending photographs to him. Marshall retaliates by ruining Barney's hookups at the bar over several days, for instance by pretending to be a doctor and telling Barney he had crabs with \"super-herpes\", or that his wife gave birth to a boy, or that the woman is the 250th that Barney has slept with.The pranks go too far and Carl (Joe Nieves) bans the four of them from the bar (including Lily and Robin, who were irritated by a woman lurking by their booth for a chance for her and her friends to sit there, along with presumably Ted).\nDistraught by the rift, Lily and Robin decide to have them make up using various drinks and discover that certain party drinks trigger various situations (e.g. daiquiris makes Marshall narcissistic, red wine brings out Barney's self-pitying side, while absinthe makes Robin hallucinate, gin gets Marshall violent, Burbon makes Ted weirdly good at beat boxing and martinis make exacerbate Lily's attraction to Robin).\nArmed with this knowledge, the two plan a drinking binge for Marshall and Barney by ordering drinks in such a way that they would get angry at each other first, then eventually reconcile. However, while the plan is underway, Marshall and Barney drink tequila shots and return to MacLaren's, where Barney tries to hit on a lesbian and Marshall eats chicken wings while smoking. The two forgive each other after Carl gives them beer and he lifts the ban on the gang.However, a round of champagne that Lily ordered results in Marshall and Barney blacking out and resuming their feud at Ted's apartment the next morning. Seeing their plan go to waste, Robin suggests that she and Lily drink absinthe, which puts them in a dream-like state.Meanwhile, Ted goes off to spend the weekend out of town with Zoey at Martha's Vineyard. When Lily tells him what happened between Marshall and Barney, he confronts Zoey while on the road (despite an agreement to never talk about the Arcadian) and told her that it was okay for her to disrupt his own plans, but seeing his friends turn on each other was too much.Ted proposes that if Zoey can spend one night in the decrepit hotel, she will have him on her side to save it from demolition, a proposal which Zoey accepts. Ted asks her why saving the Arcadian was so important to Zoey. She reveals that she grew up in the hotel as a child, and its destruction would see part of her identity gone with it. When they see the Cockamouse creep around the room and discover its offspring, Zoey admits defeat and they spend the night at Ted's apartment. The next morning, Ted tells Barney that he is on Zoey's side and doesn't want the Arcadian demolished.The last scene of the episode shows Lily and Robin pulling a prank on the women who stole their booth. When Barney's assistant shows the women a photograph, they scramble out of the bar in disgust. Lily and Robin immediately come back to clean up the booth.", "episode_3": "Future Ted states that during his early years as a professor, he had a simple goal: to give a lecture that would change someone's life. Ted believes he accomplished that goal, and recalls the story.The story begins when Ted is just beginning a lecture. He takes an airplane out of his pocket, but Future Ted decides to go back in time a couple days earlier, when Barney surprises Ted one day by telling him that Goliath National Bank is reconsidering Ted's design of the new GNB building that had been scrapped before. Ted is intrigued, but decides he doesn't want to work for GNB, with he and Marshall likening them to the Galactic Empire.\nBarney seems to accept this, but later is seen to be ignoring Ted. Ted realizes Barney is playing him like he would a hot girl, as Barney really does want Ted to design the building. Barney's attempts to \"woo\" Ted seem to be working, as Ted finds himself wanting to accept the job more and more. Finally, Barney tells Ted they have already accepted another offer, with Marshall backing up his claim. Ted goes to Barney and offers to do the job at half price, but Marshall reveals they hadn't accepted another offer, only pretending to do so to convince Ted even more. Shocked that Barney and Marshall had lied to him, Ted declines the offer again.Meanwhile, Robin reveals she may not have gotten over her relationship with Don (Benjamin Koldyke) as easily as everyone thought; having seen him on TV for a news show in Chicago, she ends up drunk dialing him and leaving angry messages. Lily tries to get her to delete Don's number, though at first she lies about it and leaves another message while drunk.\nRobin confronts Lily about some of her unfinished passions and asks her to delete the number of a karate Dojo. Lily had accidentally walked into a group of kids training, where to her embarrassment had been trounced by one of the kids.\nMarshall also deletes the number of a Booker for the club where his band played once 4 years ago, and Marshall is forced to agree they would probably never get back together.\nWhen they delete the numbers Robin deletes Don's number, but ends up calling him anyway, this time somber and leaving another message as she had memorized his number. Robin admits that the reason why she's having such a hard time getting over Don is because their relationship ended so quickly, it feels unfinished. Some time later, Robin attempts to leave him another message, but finds she has forgotten his number; smiling, she realizes she finally got some of the closure she wanted.While giving a lecture on Antoni Gaud\u00ed's unfinished magnum opus, the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, Ted changes his mind and rushes to Barney to accept the job; he however forces Barney to take him out to dinner first, as Barney had stated he never took a woman out before \"closing the deal\" first.\nLily and Marshall show they're still attached to their respective passions; Lily practices a kick, while Marshall sings like he had in his gig.\nIn the end Lily returns to the karate Dojo to confront the kid; now older, the boy replies, \"I knew this day would come\" and he and Lily rush towards each other to fight.", "episode_15": "With Marshall living with his mother for a while due to his father's recent death, he is forced to hear of the gang through phone calls, and is glad to hear of an interesting story developing between Ted and Zoey. Robin explains that it began when Zoey offered to hook up Ted with her cousin (Katy Perry). Future Ted is unable to remember her name, and simply refers to her as \"Honey\", due to the fact she is endearingly gullible, which prompts people to say \"Oh, honey\" to her in a chiding tone. Her landlord installed a security camera right in her shower making her believe that it is for her safety, she gave a Nigerian Prince her social security number, she had a TV audition behind the KFC, and she is going to be on Lost.\nAt MacLaren's, Ted and Honey appear to be hitting it off, although Barney is also clearly enamored of her. Ted decides to let Barney leave with Honey, later confessing to Robin that he's fallen in love with Zoey. Knowing that such love is forbidden, as Zoey is married, Ted holds an intervention for himself, with him initially deciding that he should stop being friends with Zoey. The others don't want to lose Zoey as a friend, and convince Ted to get over his feelings for her.In the present, Marshall receives a call from Barney, who tells him that something strange had happened after hooking up with Honey. The following evening, Barney ran into Zoey and revealed that Ted had not hooked up with Honey after all; hearing this, Zoey hugged Barney. Marshall realizes that Zoey is in love with Ted as well (And she tried to push him away by setting him up with Honey and was overjoyed to hear that Ted never went home with Honey), and calls Ted. Before he can tell him, though, Ted explains that he has his own story to tell.\nEarlier, Zoey had arrived at his apartment to hang out, and Ted finally told her that he couldn't hang out with her anymore, but could not say why. Lily then calls Marshall, explaining that Ted had actually said that Lily hated her. Zoey rushed over to Lily to ask why; Lily initially tried to play along, but after hearing that Zoey was going through some tough times, lied and said that the reason for them being unable to hang out was because Robin hated her. Robin lied as well and said that Marshall hated her, much to the latter's annoyance, because Robin reasoned that Zoey would never call Marshall so soon after losing his father.At this point, Honey calls Marshall, as Barney had left his cell phone in her room. Honey reveals that Barney had broken down in tears after she asked him about his dad (by saying \"Who's your Daddy?\"); Barney had tried to contact him but had not received a response yet. Remembering Lily's story of Zoey going through a tough time, Marshall pretends to be Zoey's therapist and Honey reveals that Zoey is divorcing her husband, The Captain, as well as getting her own apartment.\nAs Marshall explains the situation to his mother and brother (who have both been eavesdropping on Marshall's phone conversations throughout the episode), Zoey confronts Ted, demanding to know the real reason that he doesn't want to be friends. Ted claims that he hates her and begins rambling off all the things he likes about her, though saying them in a way to make it seem like they annoy him.\nMarshall separately calls Zoey and Ted, informing them of their feelings for each other and also telling Ted about Zoey's divorce, and the two then embrace and kiss.", "episode_19": "The gang goes to the house that Ted bought in \"Home Wreckers\". While Ted explains his plans for the house, Barney attempts to persuade Ted to add erotic and sensual objects. It is then revealed that the trip is an intervention. Barney believes it is for Ted, but it is actually for him.A few days before the intervention, the gang attempted to watch TV in Barney's apartment and they learn that Barney does not know how to use tools, so he has called a repairman to fix the TV. However, instead of the repairman, Barney is greeted at the door by Jerome Whittaker (John Lithgow), Barney's father and stated he has received his letter.\nLater, Barney related to the gang his meeting with Jerry, telling them how he is a tour manager who loves Scotch, suits, and loose women as much as he does. Though the gang is happy for Barney, they worry that Jerry will hurt him again, which Barney brushes off.\nHowever, the gang is later approached by Jerome at the bar, who reveals that he is actually a driving instructor with a normal suburban life. He drinks milk and goes to bed at 9:30 PM. During the actual meeting with Barney, Jerry attempted to impress him but failed miserably. He talked about publishing 3 books on asparagus, invented the word \"Furgling\" which means fumbling for keys. He knew that Barney wanted him to be a big ladies' man, so Jerome begged a woman at the beer counter to write him her phone number.\nBarney wants Jerome to be his wing-man, but Jerome says that he has a family now. And now, Barney is not even picking Jerome's calls, which is why he reached out to his friends.Meanwhile, the gang begins to note all of the things that each of them never learned, noticing it when Barney mentions he doesn't know how to use a screwdriver. Robin points out Ted's odd pronunciation of the word \"chameleon.\" Ted points out that Robin is unaware that the North Pole is a real place. Later, it is revealed how she does not know that reindeer are real (despite being Canadian, where reindeer are found practically everywhere) or that Jack Kennedy and John F. Kennedy are the same person.\nTed also points out Lily's bad throwing skills and that she has a terrible aim. Marshall is the only one whom the gang does not mention, and he eventually asks the gang to pick on him. He reveals that he is aware that the gang has been careful around him ever since his father died, and says that he just wants to feel normal again. The group does resume picking on Marshall, mocking his inability to wink or swallow pills, his tendency to add too much water to his oatmeal, how he always misses one belt loop and how he is too old to ask to see the cockpit on planes. Marshall thanks them, grateful to be treated like an equal again.The gang reveals that Barney's intervention is about seeing his father, who lives nearby Ted's house. Barney reluctantly agrees to have dinner with Jerome's family and meets Jerry's wife, Cheryl (Nancy Lenehan), and his son JJ. Barney acts antagonistically toward JJ, but stops when he learns that JJ stands for Jerome Junior. Upset, Barney abruptly leaves and Jerome follows him to the garage, where Barney is attempting to steal the basketball hoop attached to it. When Barney expresses his resentment that Jerry is nothing more than a \"lame suburban dad\" and that JJ got to have a normal childhood while he did not, Jerry apologizes for abandoning Barney and helps him remove the hoop while teaching him how to use a screwdriver.\nBarney and the rest of the group go back to Ted's house and takes basketball hoop with him. Barney tells Ted that he should have it for his future kids, choking up as he says, \"a kid needs a hoop,\" as his friends comfort him.", "episode_1": "Future Ted (Bob Saget) tells his kids that there are two big days in any love story: the day you meet the girl of your dreams and the day you marry her. \"A little ways down the road\", Ted (Josh Radnor) is shown sitting in a church courtyard. Marshall sits down beside him, and they share a beer. Marshall (Jason Segel) asks Ted if he's nervous, but Ted denies it, claiming he's simply worried about whether it'll rain.In the present day, Ted is sitting in MacLaren's, grading papers, again peeling the label off his beer. Barney (Neil Patrick Harris) sits down across from him, lamenting that \"the season of exposed skin is over\", and it'll be another eight months before girls begin wearing sundresses again.\nTed reveals that he's been thinking about trying to talk to the beautiful blonde girl at the bar. Barney attempts to \"solve\" his problem, by calling dibs. They begin arguing over the girl and about the legality of dibs, with Ted threatening to take Barney to court, prompting Barney to call dibs on having Marshall as his lawyer. It's revealed that Marshall and Lily (Alyson Hannigan) recently decided to start a family, and tonight is their first attempt. Marshall is getting ready to leave his office, while Lily is setting the mood at their apartment.Ted decides to ignore Barney's dibs, and talks to the girl regardless. Barney then paints a scenario where Ted and the girl get married, and at their wedding Barney reveals that he had dibs on her. Everyone is shocked, Lily faints, and the girl, upon realizing Barney had dibs, slaps Ted and proceeds to make out with Barney on the table. Ted concedes, allowing Barney to have his shot, as Robin (Cobie Smulders) enters.Since her breakup with Don (Benjamin Koldyke), Robin has not been taking care of herself. Her clothes are dirty, her hair unkempt; she is and she looks very much worse for wear. It's revealed that a few months earlier, Robin told Ted that she knows herself pretty well, and that some time over the next few months, she was going to try and sleep with him again, and that he should try and say no. He agrees, but she reminds him how difficult it may be. Two weeks later, she tries, but as she was just crying on the couch, covered in junk food and tissues, Ted finds it easy to turn her down.Back to the present, Marshall and Lily enter MacLaren's, and Ted asks if she's pregnant yet. They say no, and explain why: Marshall's dad, Marvin Eriksen Sr. (Bill Fagerbakke), sent them a bassinet, and Lily is upset that Marshall told his father they were trying to have a baby.As Marshall and Lily move to a different booth to continue fighting, Ted offers to buy Barney's dibs, for $20. Barney accepts, but as he attempts to walk over to the girl, Cindy arrives and greets the girl. Ted quickly sits back down and tries to hide himself, explaining that he and Cindy used to date, and it ended on bad terms. Ted then remembers that although he never met Cindy's roommate, from what he knows about her she could be the one, and that this girl could be the roommate.On the other side of the bar, Lily questions Marshall about who else he's told, and it's revealed that his entire office knows. Lily complains that Marvin is too involved in their lives, and it's shown that he called her to try to force Lily to adopt Marshall's last name, gave her advice on her fights with Marshall, and even advised her to put pickles on her sandwich while she was eating it.Barney tells Robin that she's down talking about the guy now flirting with the girl at the bar because she's jealous; she's lost \"it\", while the girl at the bar still has \"it.\" He tells her she's passed her \"hotness expiration date\", and she leaves.Marshall and Lily are still arguing, and Marshall asks when he can tell his father about the baby. Lily thinks they should tell him after their baby is born, which causes Marshall to reveal that he planned to have his mom and dad come live with them after their baby was born. Cindy spots Ted, and they go off to speak to one another in private.As he leaves, Lily sits down and asks Barney if her belief that Marshall calls his dad too often is unjustified. Barney tells her she shouldn't ask his opinion, because if he had his dad's number he would always be on the phone with him. Robin then enters the bar, cleaned up, wearing makeup, and wearing a sundress. Within fourteen seconds, a man comes over. She begins celebrating, having proved Barney wrong that she's \"still got it.\" She sits at the booth after sending the guy away, and starts eating again.Cindy apologizes to Ted for her cold demeanor after their break up, and asks if she can do anything for him. Ted suggests introducing him to her friend at the bar. She tells him to \"come say goodbye\" before he leaves.Lily follows Marshall out of the bar. It seems like they're about to start arguing again, when Marshall gets a call from his dad, asking him how everything went. Marshall ends the call, realizing that Lily was right; his dad is too involved in their life. He apologizes, and Lily explains why she didn't want him telling anyone; she doesn't want all this pressure to have a baby, because if something goes wrong or she can't get pregnant, she'll feel she's let Marshall (and everyone he's told) down.Back at MacLaren's, Ted is finally prepared to go speak to the girl at the bar. However, as he approaches, Cindy and the girl start to kiss.\nAt this point, it is revealed that Ted will meet his future wife at a wedding. Ted and Marshall are again shown sitting in the courtyard. Ted explains that he is nervous, because he's the best man, and has to give a wedding toast. Lily comes out, summoning the best man, Ted.In the present day, Marshall is on the street, going against Lily's wishes and telling about thirty people about their pregnancy attempts and that it's taking longer than they thought it would.", "episode_17": "At Hong Kong International Airport in 2021, Ted's flight to New York has been canceled. While arguing with an attendant at the departure lounge, he runs into Wendy the Waitress (Charlene Amoia). Future Ted describes how it happened.At MacLaren's, Ted and Zoey tell Wendy the Waitress how they ended up together. Wendy later reveals that she was only asking \"How's your meat\" and not \"How did you meet\".\nTed says Zoey was unhappy with her marriage to the Captain, and after a serious fight that ended with the Captain wanting a divorce, Zoey and Ted decided to give a relationship a try.\nZoey asks Ted to get her personal belongings from the Captain's apartment. The stuff has been left at the lobby. Just as Ted comes to get the box, the Captain encounters him and at his study, says that Zoey left him for a mustachioed man, narrating a different version of his last argument with Zoey. Ted fails to get the box.\nHe later returns to the apartment building, where the Captain claims that the doorman seduced Zoey. He threatens to harm the doorman, but Ted convinces him to let her go because they have nothing in common anyway. Before leaving the apartment with Zoey's box, he admits that he was the one for whom Zoey left the Captain.\nLater at MacLaren's, Zoey says that good things can come out of something bad.Meanwhile, Barney reports to the gang that his laser tag date on Valentine's Day with Nora did not go well, despite her giving him her calling card which he later tears up. Robin catches Barney smiling whenever he mentions Nora and gives him a napkin with Nora's phone number so he can call her.\nRobin says that Nora is going with another guy, which seems to bother Barney, but he claims to Robin that he doesn't even like Nora. Robin says that Barney is smitten with Nora, but is afraid of being in a real relationship with a woman.\nRobin eventually dares him to sleep with her to prove he does not like Nora. Barney shows up at Ted and Robin's apartment, which infuriates Robin because she had been encouraging him to pursue Nora. However, Barney reveals he had actually come to ask for Nora's phone number; pleased, Robin gives it to him and tells him to go for it.Lily is frustrated at home because Marshall is too fixated with watching a documentary about the Great Pacific Garbage Patch to even think about sex. Her dry streak has been going on for 5 weeks 3 days.\nHe creates a presentation for a new GNB environmental campaign which would cut their carbon footprint by half but would cost $12 million, but it is negatively received and Arthur Hobbs fires Meeker (Dan O'Brien), the only employee who liked the presentation. Marshall is spared as his father just died.\nMarshall comes home all dejected and is even more sad to hear that Lily threw out a set of 6 pack plastic rings in the garbage. He knows that the rings will make their way out to the ocean and trap a poor little bird in it.\nLily catches Marshall in the dumpster trying to find a set of Tallboy O-rings. Marshall tells Lily that his father's death means that he will never see Marshall other than a corporate stooge and he fears that starting a family right away could force him to work at GNB forever. Lily asks him to save the planet first then start raising a family.Marshall's obsession also angers Wendy the Waitress because his advocacy prompts MacLaren's to have her carry spent bottles to the recycling center every night, which results in her having back pains. Future Ted says Meeker was a MacLaren's patron who met Wendy the night he goes to the bar to confront Marshall over his dismissal. Wendy's bag of bottles breaks and Meeker helps Wendy pick them up.The ending scene shows that because they both hated Marshall, Wendy and Meeker did end up together, being on their second honeymoon when they encountered Ted at the airport. Ted says he is already married with two kids, and his relationship with Zoey did not end well. Ted begins the story of how he met his wife starting from the wedding, but Wendy interrupts saying they have to go. Ted immediately calls Marshall about the encounter.", "episode_14": "Everybody goes to St. Cloud, Minnesota, Marshall's hometown, to attend the recently deceased Marvin Eriksen's funeral. Marshall is devastated, while his mother Judy is keeping herself distracted by doing chores (according to Lily, she has not eaten or slept in the last two days). Ted and Barney unsuccessfully try to make Marshall laugh by showing him multiple videos of men getting hit in the groin in odd ways. Meanwhile, Robin amazes the gang, as well as other people at the funeral, by providing them with virtually everything they need out of her purse (from mobile chargers to drugs). She is the official \"vice\" girl at the funeral.Judy (Suzie Plakson) and Marshall learn that the funeral service will not be held by the Reverend, but by his son Trey (Danny Strong). The gang is surprised to learn that Trey used to bully Marshall in high school (especially since Trey is very short). Trey turns out to be extremely insensitive, though Judy agrees that Marvin Sr.'s (Bill Fagerbakke) last words should be the theme of the service.Marshall is reluctant to tell any such story as his last conversation with his father was over trivial issues (he was about to get on to a plane and commented that plane food is not very good. And then he went to the street where it was raining and called Marshall and made comments about some odd racial stereotypes like Koreans always having an umbrella. Marshall went down to meet his father and just before getting into a cab he asked Marshall to rent Crocodile Dundee III), while the stories told by his mother and older brothers are very touching and inspiring.\nAfter charging his phone (which was out of power since before Marvin's death), Marshall discovers that he has a voicemail from his father. Marshall does not know what to do and decides that he does not want to listen to it. Meanwhile, Robin runs into rough waters when she accidentally gives alcohol to Marshall's teen-aged cousin.\nLily takes the blame and faces Judy's outrage to let the latter vent all her emotions. Finally, an exhausted Judy eats and rests.The group tries to reason with Marshall, who counters by asking them what their father's last words to them would be should their fathers die. They realize that none of them would have anything special to say.\nTed's father is divorced and talked about how he is trying to have sex with the woman that Ted once went to prom with. Lily's dad is in jail for not paying taxes for the last 25 years. He asks $15,000 from Lily. Lily had got a call from him, and she pretends not to be home. Robin's father was disappointed in her for not achieving anything significant in her life.\nDuring the service, Marshall impulsively goes out to hear his father's message. It turns out that it was, in fact, a pocket dial. An outraged Marshall says how much his father meant to him and how unfair it is that his last message to him was a \"pocket dial\". However, as he continues to rant, Marvin discovers the pocket dial on the phone. He jokes about his error, before telling Marshall that he enjoyed his visit, and finally telling him \"I love you.\" - and immediately asks for his foot cream as his rash had started to act up again. Marshall takes comfort in the fact that his father's last words to him were \"I love you\".After the stories told by Judy, Marcus, and Marvin Jr., Marshall's turn to speak at the memorial service comes. He surprises the gang by deciding to keep his father's real last words to himself, instead telling everyone of how his father had told him to rent Crocodile Dundee 3.Judy thanks Lily for what she had done during the course of the wake while making one last crude joke at Lily's expense, stating that it was the last time, apparently resolving their strained relationship. Ted, Lily, and Robin call their fathers to have meaningful conversations with them.

However, when Barney reveals the site for the future building is to be situated on the current location of \"The Arcadian,\" a hotel that Ted describes as an architectural landmark, Ted refuses to go through with it. Barney is suspicious as to why Ted is so against the old building's demolition, and eventually has Ted reveal that he met a girl, Zoey (Jennifer Morrison).Zoey was as adamant as Ted about preserving the building, and had even organized a public protest of keeping it from getting demolished. Ted admits joining the protesters, leaving Barney stunned. Barney realizes Ted must not have told Zoey he was the architect of the new GNB building, and Ted admits he had told her he was a veterinarian. The gang remembers how Ted had a habit of changing his personality to mirror the girl he is dating. He has been an adrenaline junkie, a Merlin, a civil war enthusiast and so on.\nTed assures Barney he isn't against the plan because of Zoey, but Barney remains unconvinced, pointing out Ted had done crazy things before because of a girl. Later, Zoey reveals she had been arrested several times due to previous protests, and Ted, realizing how passionate she is, decides to join her in a picketing.\nBarney retaliates by having a billboard lowered in front of the building revealing Ted to be the architect of the new GNB building. Ted confronts Barney, who had hoped that Ted would agree to design the building after ruining his chances with Zoey.Barney tells Ted he can design the building however he likes, and at this, Ted agrees to design the building. Ted incorporates the Arcadian's facade into the new building's design, thus preventing its demolition, and eagerly shows it to Zoey. Zoey is thrilled, but then Ted notices a ring on Zoey's finger, and Zoey confirms she is married. Ted then realizes he had been doing this because of Zoey, at which he promptly throws his design away and leaves. Later, Zoey has her group throw eggs at Ted's apartment window.Meanwhile, Marshall and Lily continue to try to conceive a baby. Robin and Max have hooked up, and Marshall is happy for his former law school friend. However, after Lily tells Marshall that Max has a small penis, Marshall is flustered and is constantly thinking about it.\nWhile Marshall and Lily have dinner with Robin and Max, Marshall constantly makes references to it by mentioning sizes and trying to imply he still thinks Max is great. This makes it awkward for Robin and Lily, though Max doesn't seem to notice.\nWhen Max leaves momentarily, Marshall reprimands Robin and Lily for telling him about Max, and is then shocked to learn that Lily tells Robin about her sex life, too. Robin argues that Marshall probably does the same with other guys with \"locker room\" talk, though Marshall claims this never happens.\nLater, while having sex with Lily, Marshall is haunted by the thought of Lily telling Robin about it later, and Marshall ultimately storms out of the room. Marshall has Lily call Robin later, telling her the sex was amazing in a scripted speech, though Robin recognizes what Marshall is doing.In the end, as Marshall, Ted, Barney, and Max gather in a locker room, Max states he's thinking of breaking up with Robin due to her odd behavior in the bedroom. Ted and Barney know what he's talking about, though when Marshall tries to ask about it, Max just scoffs and says \"Locker room,\" and Max, Barney, and Ted leave.", "episode_7": "Ted is overjoyed that his class adores him, but it is because he gives out Halloween candy.

She reveals Ted tearing the Arcadian to design a new building, and the class skips to attend a protest.\nTed takes Lily's advice to not appear so gentle and threatens to have the entire class fail if they keep skipping. Technically they would be marked incomplete, but Ted thought that an \"F\" had a nice and scary ring to it.Marshall is bothered by inept fellow employee Randy (Will Forte) at work (Randy shreds important client documents that were meant to be couriered to the downtown office.\n); Barney urges Marshall to fire Randy, but Marshall doesn't wish to be so cruel like GNB is thought to be. Arthur once fired a man for wearing the same green tie as him and feels that GNB treats people like they are disposable. He does not want to fire people.\nRandy annoys Marshall so much that he fires him. Marshall feels guilty and convinces Arthur (Bob Odenkirk) to have Randy rehired and urges him to be more benevolent. Randy is thrilled he was fired, as he plans to use his severance to start a beer brewery.\nRandy doesn't take Marshall's \"good\" news about being rehired well, and promptly begins intentionally destroying Marshall's office to get himself fired, as quitting his job would not net him the severance. Arthur found Marshall's speech so memorable that he wont fire Randy even when Randy is wearing the same green tie as him. Arthur promises Randy that he will work for GNB till the day he dies. Randy is devastated.\nMarshall resists the urge to fire him despite the mess Randy is creating (throwing all the files around, removing the drawers from the cabinets and pouring orange juice all over Marshall). Randy proceeds to then shred every single file in Marshall's office to force him to terminate his employment.\nWith Marshall's office in disarray, Randy apologizes. He offers Marshall a bottle of his homemade beer; noting how good it tastes, Marshall fires Randy. Marshall believes that Randy deserves a chance to live his dream, since Marshall himself could not live his own dream and got stuck at a corporate job.\nFuture Ted states Randy starts a brewing company, brewing a beer called Wharmpess, which becomes a success.Robin continues to be annoyed by her new co-anchor, Becky. She is even more bothered when Becky appears in a commercial, which Robin thinks is unprofessional for a journalist. Robin had always prided herself on maintaining high integrity and journalistic standards.\nThe morning after Halloween, the gang catches Robin coming back from last night's parties, assuming she had a one-night stand.\nLily believes she had slept with Randy, due to Randy appearing to have a slight interest in her.

After hanging up, Ted argues with Robin about his ability to be an effective best man, especially in the event that Punchy gets cold feet. Robin reveals that she auditioned as a \"currency rotation specialist\" (coin-flip bimbo) in the game show Million Dollar Heads or Tails, hosted by Alex Trebek. Ted rebukes her for bailing on her New Year's Resolution to be working for the Worldwide News Network by the end of the year. Robin admits that she applied for the Network, but only an associate researcher position is available. When Marshall and Lily break the news of the pregnancy, Robin becomes aware of how her own life is stalling, and resolves to take the research position, but when they reveal the false positive, she changes her mind once more, deciding that she is content to be a \"coin-flip bimbo\".Barney, meanwhile, has received an end-of-year bonus, which he intends to spend on luxuries for himself, including a suit with diamond pinstripes. When he hears about the pregnancy, he realizes how unfulfilled his selfishness has left him, and decides to spend the money helping others. After buying the patrons of MacLaren's designer clothes, toys and condoms, and taking them to a strip club, Barney goes to see Sam Gibbs, his brother's father and a minister, to make a donation to his church. He is in the process of writing a check for $10,000 when he gets the news about the false positive, and adds a decimal point to turn it into $100, returning to his selfish ways and, indeed, buying his diamond-striped suit.Immediately after they discover the pregnancy test's results, Marshall and Lily begin to panic about how unprepared they are to raise a child, and scramble to complete remodeling of their apartment in one night before the baby arrives. They announce the news of the pregnancy to the gang, and pretend to share their excitement, but are still terrified inside. After an argument about playing music for the child, the couple see the doctor, who tells them Lily is not pregnant.Marshall and Lily meet up with the rest of the gang outside the theater and admit that they are relieved about the false positive. Since they are not ready for kids yet, Marshall says they're considering getting a dog for now. When Robin and Barney agree with Marshall, Ted explodes in anger, smashes the gingerbread house and angrily orders everybody to reconsider their decisions, forcing Marshall and Lily to go straight back home to try to conceive, ordering Robin to take the research job, and yelling to the \"criminals of New York\" about Barney's suit, effectively making him a walking target for theft. When Punchy calls him, suffering the predicted cold feet, Ted angrily orders him to get married, solving that problem as well.\nAfter everybody leaves, he decides to watch It's a Wonderful Life all by himself. In the end, Marshall and Lily continue trying to conceive, Barney makes his intended cash donation to the ministry and also donates suits for jobless people to wear to interviews, and Robin begins her first day at Worldwide News.

They go whipping, but Ted ends up cutting Marshall on the cheeks.\nThat night, Ted has a dream about his first day. However, the dream quickly becomes a nightmare (he shows up to class without his pants on and his students consider him a failed architect), causing Ted to wake in a panic and find Barney (Neil Patrick Harris) rifling through his nightstand for condoms. Barney advises Ted not to take questions on his first day in class.At the actual first day of class, Ted quickly becomes anxious and alternates between being a stern authority figure and laid-back buddy. Recalling his dream and deciding to take Barney's advice to not take any questions during the first class, Ted fails to learn from his students that he is actually in the wrong classroom. When the real professor arrives and announces that the class is actually for Economics, a humiliated Ted races across campus to his actual classroom. Exhausted and embarrassed, Ted doesn't have the energy to think about what kind of teacher he'll be, and simply starts teaching, which turns out well.

Marshall laments being left out of the occasion. Barney rushes to the arena and interrupts the New York Rangers \"Kiss Cam\" by ineffectually punching Brad in the face. After apologizing, he and Robin are still unable to admit that they are dating.Back at the apartment, after another night of sex, Robin tries to leave the room, but the doorknob detaches. Lily reveals that she sabotaged the door to force them to define their relationship. After several notes that fail to satisfy Lily (we are just hanging out, we are seeing where things go, we are Barnman and Robin, ), they decide to lie and tell Lily that they are boyfriend and girlfriend, though the lie clearly has elements of sincerity. Lily lets them out, and Barney and Robin go out to brunch.

With Barney and Robin now a couple, they hope to turn their luck around. This time they have prepared an entire flow of the room, and the stories they are going to share at each station.After an evening together, Lily and Marshall are under the impression that it was \"the best night ever\", despite Robin and Barney being obviously bored and uncomfortable. They tell Ted that Marshall got super intense about the cheese (Lily is a gourmet cook and all she allows Marshall to serve is the Gouda block of cheese). They keep shoving platters of food in their faces. They would freak out if anything did not go according to plan (the egg timer broke).

Devastated, Lily and Marshall blame each other for the failure, citing Marshall's bizarre photo montages of trivial events (Cat sitting for Lily's mom who jumped out the window, cat funeral, spilling soy sauce on the sofa while eating Chinese and flipping the cushion to hide it from Lily) and Lily's tendency to plan big outings too quickly. Lily says Marshall messed up the egg timer for the charades, but Marshall says he was also in charge of the Gouda.After a week apart from Lily and Marshall, Robin and Barney realize they miss their friends, and head over to their condo, only to find them enjoying the company of another couple (Py (K.T. Tatara) & Shea (Maura McCarthy)). Barney and Robin are crushed by the rejection.They interrupt another couple's night at Lily and Marshall's apartment, leading them outside with a trail of egg timers for Charades. In the rain, Barney and Robin ask for one more chance, which Marshall and Lily grant them, attracted by their \"bad boy... and girl\" mystique. They promise to never fight again, and share a hug.Ted has settled into the persona of a professor, often wearing a tweed jacket. He claims it attracts the ladies, but after a woman leaves his apartment in the morning without having sex, Barney calls him the \"Sexless Innkeeper.\" Barney says that the women are just looking for a place to crash for the night as they live too far away and Ted lives just above the bar. He elaborates with a poem set in a Dickensian version of Queens, where he was caught in a blizzard, walked a few blocks to an ugly woman's apartment, and feigned sleep to avoid sex. Ted is annoyed at the new nickname.As Barney and Robin leave for brunch with Lily and Marshall, Ted recites a poem of his own for Barney, telling the tale of a busty young blonde woman who was turned on by his professor persona. Barney is skeptical, but is left speechless when the young woman appears at Ted's bedroom door, inviting Ted back to bed, thus ending the reign of the Sexless Innkeeper.", "episode_3": "It all starts when Ted overhears Robin complaining to Lily about Barney. It seems Barney is having a hard time adjusting to being in a real relationship (he keeps climbing out the staircase at 4 am, He won't support her emotionally). Robin is frustrated and tells Lily that she might have to break up with Barney if things don't change.Ted relays all of this to Barney who scoffs at the idea of being more sensitive. Even so, he does start shaping up and begins to look like the ideal boyfriend. However, Robin sees this sudden change in behavior, coupled with the fact that he claims to be working late but can't be found at the office, as signs that Barney is cheating on her. Robin is determined to find the truth and presents Lily Barney's briefcase which she breaks into in search of proof. There she finds a college notebook, in it is information about Robin. Marshall admits that the notebook is from a class that Barney is taking from Ted: Robin 101.\nTed teaches him stuff like her age, her favorite hockey team, don't cry in front of her. Barney had attention deficit disorder as a kid and is easily distracted. Top 10 Robin facial expressions and their meanings: The hunger look (leading to weird laughter or falling asleep in strange places) or the rage: if you ever see that expression, just run and don't try to take a picture of it.Meanwhile, Marshall found an old barrel while cleaning his stuff out of the storage space in the apartment building. The barrel, which he referred to as Mabel, served as his night-stand until Lily claimed to be allergic to barrel resin and which made him stop using it. He plans to leave it in the \"Bermuda Triangle\": the curb outside the building where he and Ted left things they wanted to give away. Items left on the curb would disappear almost instantly. However, Marshall is disappointed when no one seems to want the barrel.Robin and Lily go through the notebook discovering a shocking amount of personal information about Robin including \"surprising erogenous zones\" (the Left knee) and how to deflect arguments with her. Although Ted did have to struggle to get through to the easily-distracted Barney, after dating Robin for a year, he is able to give Barney a wealth of information on her. If Robin says I Love You, she has already broken up with you. If she really loves you, she will say You are an Idiot.\nOther revelations include that Robin can be distracted by the topic of the Canucks' 2004 division title, proper gun cleaning (during which it is also revealed that she has an uncle whose thumbs were blown off), and emperor penguins.\nNever play the guess who game with her. Never cry, Never show a YouTube clip of an animal playing a musical instrument.\nIt's also revealed that no amount of success will be enough for her without six simple words from her dad: \"Robin, I'm proud of you eh.\".. Get her butterscotch when she is PMSing.Robin and Lily head down to Ted's classroom where Ted is holding the \"Robin 101\" classes. Robin angrily confronts the two about the violation of her privacy and how she thought Barney was cheating on her. She claims that Barney is cheating by taking classes from Ted. She also claims that half of the things Ted believes about her are wrong. She only pretended to be aroused by the Left knee as he wouldn't leave her alone.\nRobin angrily storms out.Back at the bar, Ted apologizes to Robin for divulging so much personal information that was between the two of them. Calmed down, Robin admits that she is touched that Ted remembered so much from when they were dating and she forgives him. Ted points out how hard Barney has been working at keeping Robin.Outside, Robin meets Barney where he instantly apologizes and offers to ditch the notebook, tossing it atop Mabel. He explains that he only did it because he was afraid she was going to dump him. She smiles, says \"you're an idiot\", and kisses him. Robin points out that they shouldn't leave the notebook lying around, as it contains a lot of personal information about her, but when they turn back to Mabel, they find it has disappeared. The barrel is still sitting on the curb.Earlier, when Ted is showing Barney slides of Robin, a photo of the Flatiron building is somehow mixed in with the slides. In the final scene, the same thing happens in Ted's architecture class, only this time an embarrassing photo of Robin (she is shown drinking a beer while sitting on the toilet) is mixed in with photos of buildings", "episode_5": "Future Ted explains that Robin's Canadian quirks and mannerisms were strange (slang, imperiousness to cold, and severe aggression in bar fights), which got her into trouble in the fall of 2009. After a bar fight, she is charged with assault and could be deported unless she gets American citizenship. Barney takes the opportunity to reiterate that Canada is lame and America is awesome. He encourages her to take the citizenship test and teaches her to act as obnoxiously as a typical American. America is \"Lets buy something bad for us, and then sue the people who made it\". \"Not only are Americans wrong, they belligerently stick to their stand and insult others in the process\" Robin takes on the role perfectly, but on the way back home, she walks past her Canadian bar, the Hoser Hut, and tempted by her heritage, she goes in. After some serious drinking with Canada's national women's curling team, she blacks out and ends up in a Toronto hotel room.Barney tracks her down and convinces her to come home and take the test. They stop at a Tim Hortons coffee shop, where the cashier mistakes Robin for American. Robin had American money, didn't watch the hockey game last night and no please or thank you for the coffee. Downtrodden, Robin feels neither Canadian nor American. Barney makes a speech ridiculing Canadians for letting such an amazing woman go and then is promptly beaten up by some men. After some free Canadian health care for Barney, they return home and Robin decides she wants dual citizenship.Meanwhile, Ted hears that the pizzeria in Chicago named Gazzola's is closing. He and Marshall used to drive straight from Wesleyan to the pizzeria when they were in college, even though the pizza was awful. The road trips were fueled only by jerky and Tantrum. Tantrum is a soda which according to Future Ted had \"the highest caffeine level legally available over the counter\".. it was eventually banned after extensive testing by the FDA in which some mice exploded after drinking it.\nThis trip helped cement their friendship, and Ted proposes they take one last trip. Pumped to spend some personal time with Marshall and reeling from a severe caffeine high after drinking a can of Tantrum, Ted is disappointed to find out that Lily is coming as well. Ted was dreading this since he knew that ever since he got married, Marshall had turned from an \"I\" into a \"We\".Lily needs bathroom breaks frequently and insists (instead of rock music like the Proclaimers) they listen to an audio-book about a man's relationship with his dog (narrated by Kenny Rogers). Ted is annoyed and becomes exasperated when they stop at a bed and breakfast called Crumpet Manor, which is listed in the American registry of historic B&Bs. They have catered to couples since 1881, instead of driving through the night. Ted has nothing to do at the B&B.\nAfter Lily and Marshall engage in some couple activities, Ted tricks Marshall into driving with him to Gazzola's in his bathrobe. At first Marshall is aghast that Lily will freak out when she wakes up, but soon forgets all about her as he starts enjoying the road trip. They get to Chicago & enjoy the greasy pizza, but Marshall becomes guilty over leaving Lily and they leave. Ted admits his anger at Lily tagging along and the duo stop speaking.They drive back to the bed and breakfast not speaking to each other, but the they are listening to the audio-book story. The dog owner married his wife, and the dog felt left out. The dog didn't know that the owner still loved him and perhaps he should have kept aside some playing time with him.\nThis makes Ted and Marshall realize they need each other's friendship and they reconcile. Lily hasn't even noticed that they're gone because she has been powerfully sedated, nearly comatose state of relaxation, by the hotel's spa services. After some severe stomach pains from the pizza, the three head back to New York. They are worried they may have left Lily behind, but she is shown clinging to the top of the car using the power of the highly caffeinated soda.", "episode_2": "Future Ted describes a date he went on in 2009, and the screen quickly changes to show a side-by-side shot of him preparing in 2009 and 2002. It turns out that Ted is about to go on a blind date with Jen (Lindsay Sloane), a woman he went on another blind date with in 2002.Meanwhile, the rest of the gang grapples with relationship questions. Though Barney claims to have tickets to an origin of Chewbacca exhibit, which Marshall is genuinely excited about (but the girls nerd out and refuse to accompany the guys), they instead head to the Lusty Leopard strip bar, where Marshall is uncomfortable because he considers fantasies cheating. Barney claims that Robin would be ok with him being at a strip club and would be into it herself.\nHe explains to Barney that every time he wants to fantasize, he must create an elaborate scenario where Lily must die of a terminal illness (like a fatal hiccup disorder). While they discuss this, Jasmine (Alyson Hannigan) - a stripper who looks exactly like Lily - appears on stage, exciting Barney to no end.After going to exactly the same restaurant and exchanging the same dialogue, including a pun about shellfish that Jen describes as \"really bad\", Ted and Jen realize they are repeating their blind date from seven years ago. They remember that the date was horrible, from Ted's snobbish behavior (pointed out spelling mistakes in the menu) to Jen's obsession with her cats and her ex-boyfriend. She also didn't offer to pay when the check arrives\nFrightened by the prospect of having to date everyone in New York again, they decide to retrace their steps to find the mistakes of the first date. Like Jen kept dropping hints that she was feeling cold, but Ted never offered her his jacket.Barney and Marshall return to MacLaren's and tell Robin and Lily about Lily's doppelganger. It is also revealed that the gang has seen two other doppelgangers; a butch \"Lesbian Robin\", and \"Mustache Marshall\", Hispanic lawyer (or game show host) Se\u00f1or Justicia. Lily is excited about the find, but Robin gets mad about Barney going to a strip club. Barney makes Marshall tell Lily about his death fantasies that he uses to justify thinking about other women.Learning new things about themselves on the first date, Ted and Jen head to MacLaren's, where the gang is there to help them retrace the events of the 2002 date. They repeat the same issues with Ted that Jen has already pointed out like: expect a standing ovation for picking a $19 check and the menu typo goldmine.\nJen reveals that she thought Ted was checking out a woman at the bar, when Ted and Barney were really looking at \"Mustache Marshall\". Ted and Jen head up to the roof, and after they share a kiss they suddenly realize why they never had another date: Ted never called her. Ted apologizes for his blunder and gives a version of what might have happened had they gotten together. They would have gotten married.Lily tells Marshall she's fine with him thinking about other women, at least as long as she's alive in the fantasy. She takes Marshall back to the strip club to fantasize about her doppelganger to get over his discomfort. Barney and Robin go too, where everyone recognizes him, stoking Robin's anger. She tells Barney how uncomfortable the thought of him going to a strip club makes her, but he ignores her. Lily is so enthralled by her stripper twin that she and Marshall get a private dance. Robin wants to have a serious talk about the relationship, but Barney remains oblivious.Before Ted and Jen can kiss again on the roof, he stops and realizes that their quirks (like finding typos in menus, or loving and talking about their cats) are part of who they are and that they should hold out for someone who'll not just tolerate them, but like them. Future Ted then tells his kids that when he told the shellfish pun to their mother, she laughed (almost completely sincerely).Back at the strip club, Marshall comments to Lily that Jasmine is having trouble on stage. When \"Lily\" responds with a thick accent and cigarette in hand, \"Jasmine\" falls on stage and he goes to help her as the viewers and Marshall realize that \"Jasmine\" dancing right now is Lily and \"Lily\" with a thick accent is Jasmine."}, "season_4": {"episode_2": "Future Ted begins by stating that when he first moved to New York City, it was an ugly, dirty place, but goes on to say that it changed, unfortunately, with good bars becoming banks, like Goliath National Bank, the bank Barney's company just bought (it took 2 months and cost 2000 jobs), which he advises Marshall to get a job with. Lily rebukes this suggestion, saying even though Marshall had been to a lot of bad job interviews (and with every interview his expectations from himself and from his job kept going down), he was still going to be an environmental lawyer.Later, the group goes to the bar, and are advised by Wendy the waitress (Charlene Amoia) to have the burger, a new special from the new cook. After an argument, they agree to try the burger, mainly because Robin hadn't eaten anything in two days due to a new diet. Once the burgers arrive (Robin's is late), the group all say how good the burger is, except for Marshall, who says it's just 'OK', seeing as he had the best burger in New York eight years ago.Marshall explains that he was scared and bewildered when he first moved to New York, but quickly finds the city is nicer than he thought. While taking a walk, he accidentally finds a burger joint, and has the 'best burger in New York'. He also notices an autographed picture of Regis Philbin on the wall, saying how good the burger was. Afterwards, he rushes to tell Ted about the place, but quickly forgets where it was, being new to the city. Since then, Marshall has tried every burger joint he can in an attempt to find the place, even meeting with Regis, who says he can't find where the place is either, and is also desperate to find it. He gives Barney his number so he can call him if he finds the joint.\nA customer from the next booth says he knows the place, the corner bistro. Marshall brushes him off saying that its only the highest rated burger on the Zagat guide, which Marshall has already eaten and that's not the burger. He has already tried every so-called best burger in NYC trying to find that burger. Corner Bistro, Paul's place, 21, Veggie Heaven and many more.When Robin says she knows the place, the group rushes downtown to find it (before Robin can try her burger). On the way, Barney texts Regis telling him where to find the place, causing him to leave a TV show recording. They all order the burger (Robin's is late, again), and once more they agree it's an incredible burger (Lily has a burg-asm, Barney wants to spend the evening with the burger, take it to dinner, then a movie and then to his place for fooling around). Unfortunately, Marshall says it's not the right burger (sesame freckled bun like the breast of an angel, resting on a bed of ketchup and mustard, with their flavors mingling. A pickle, playful little pickle, a slice of tomato and lettuce. A patty of ground beef so exquisite, breaking and combining in the mouth in a fugue of sweets and savories. This is not a sandwich, this is God speaking to us through food).\nMarshall becomes desperate, and Lily says he's really upset about not getting a new job. The radius of the region where he goes without pants has been increasing over the last 2 weeks. At first it was within the house, then one day he went to get the paper, day after that went downstairs to get the mail, culminating in him going to a burger joint in his underpants. As the self esteem grows smaller, the underpants radius gets bigger.\nThe group resolves to find the place for Marshall, and asks a waitress for help. She tells them \"this burger joint was modeled after another one, uptown\".Again, the group rushed to the new joint. On the way, Regis calls, and Barney tells him about the new place. In frustration, Regis mangles a post box with his bare hands. Once they arrive, Marshall is sure it's the right location, but in its place is a Goliath National Bank ATM from Barney's bank. Lily attacks Barney, and Marshall admits the reason Barney's been talking up the bank is that Marshall got a job there. While they talk, a guy nearby promoting a strip club tells them the place isn't gone, but has just moved. After paying him, thanks to the ATM, he tells them where the place is.Finally, the group reaches the joint, Marshall deems it to be the exact place, and the gang finally enjoys the burger together (Robin wants the burger inside her, Barney is worried that he might get the burger pregnant), as well as fulfilling Marshall's long search for it.", "episode_1": "Future Ted (Josh Radnor) tells his children (son (David Henrie) & daughter (Lyndsy Fonseca) that the longest pause in anyone's life is right after they propose to someone; Present Ted, during this pause, imagined all of Stella's (Sarah Chalke) possible responses (\"No\", \"Oh, God no\", \"I already agreed to marry the quarterback from your high school\", etc.), after which Stella gave her actual answer of \"Yes\". Ted and Stella spend the summer happily engaged; Barney (Neil Patrick Harris) goes through physical therapy; and Marshall (Jason Segel) copes poorly with unemployment. At McLaren's, Robin (Cobie Smulders) expresses discontent with her news-casting job, describing herself as a bogeyman with a teleprompter. In response, Barney laughs too hard at this joke.The next day, Barney gets Lily (Alyson Hannigan) to come over to his apartment and confides that he is in love with Robin. She agrees to help him if he will stop having one-night stands with bimbos. He tries to call Robin but panics and leaves a high-pitched gibberish voice mail instead, followed by another awkward, unsuccessful phone call.\nLily is perplexed since Barney has called a million girls, but Barney says they were just booty calls. On booty calls, the later it is the less words you use. At 9 pm \"Hey baby, it's Barney, are you busy tonight?\", at 12:30 am \"Barney, busy ?\", at 3 am \" ? \"Lily sets Barney up on a dinner date with Robin, where he behaves quite unlike himself: not taking advantage of opportunities to make sex jokes, ignoring their waitress's generous cleavage, and being interested in the goings-on of Robin's day.\nAfterward, Robin gets April (Alyssa Julya Smith) (their waitress) to go home with Barney by telling her that he is the second baseman for the New York Yankees. Barney tells April that on any other night, he would try to convince her that he was a Yankee, but he can't because he is in love with the girl who just left. At Barney's apartment, he tells Lily about what happened. Lily is sympathetic until April comes out of Barney's bedroom.\nHe admits that he lied about not hooking up with April but that all the other stuff he said is true. Lily leaves, disappointed. Barney turns on the TV to Metro News 1, affectionately watches a brief segment of Robin's newscast, and goes back into his bedroom with a smile on his face.Marshall asks Ted for some wedding shower gift ideas for Stella. He asks if Stella likes to cook, what her favorite color is, or if she has any hobbies; Ted doesn't know the answer to any of these questions. It is determined that Ted doesn't know Stella's eye color, so he says they are the color of the ocean after a storm, though he doesn't actually know what color that is.\nTed later makes dinner for Stella and uses peanuts as the \"secret ingredient\", which, unknown to him, Stella is deathly allergic to. After they go to the hospital, Ted and Stella ask each other their \"firsts\" (first kiss, etc.), and she replies \"Dale Harris, 2nd Grade\" multiple times.During that dialogue, Ted finds out that Stella has never seen Star Wars, his favorite movie of all time. Marshall is shocked when he learns this, saying that \"nobody\" hasn't seen Star Wars. They end up watching it and Ted concludes that if Stella dislikes it, he cannot marry her. The next night, Ted and Stella watch Star Wars, but Ted is really watching Stella to gauge her reactions. She mistakes this for foreplay and tries to kiss him, but he rebuffs her with \"great scene, great scene\". Eventually Stella asks him to leave the room for the time being, so she can watch the movie alone. When it is over, she tells Ted and Marshall she loved it.\nAfter an ecstatic Ted leaves, Stella confides to Marshall that she hated it. She can't understand how everyone can just understand Chewbacca all the time. Marshall is very concerned, but Stella is convinced that she can pretend to love Star Wars for the rest of her life with Ted, to which Marshall gives her his blessing to marry Ted.", "episode_3": "Ted is complaining about having to travel so far to see Stella in New Jersey, as she is often asleep by the time he gets there. It also means he misses some key events with the group, like Barney trying to pick up a lesbian by dressing in feminine clothing, and Robin getting promoted to the national anchor job.\nWhen he tells Stella about this, she suggests the group comes to New Jersey for a night out. At first, the group rejects this idea, making fun of New Jersey, and also reminding Ted of how much he hates the place himself (he refers to New Jersey as a shit he takes daily). He talks them into accepting, and says that soon he will not have to go back again, as Stella and her daughter will move in with him after they are married.Robin is sick of her job, as she often reports stupid stories and has to make bad, sometimes insensitive puns. After being offered a major national anchor job, she immediately accepts, and makes her farewell broadcast, with a terrible speech (written by Ted).On Saturday, Ted, Marshall, Lily and Barney head to New Jersey for a night out, but instead find that Stella's babysitter canceled, and they have to stay in. Ted reminds them that being together is what's important, but Marshall, Barney and Lily are desperate to get back home. Stella overhears their complaining, and takes them into the basement, saying it's 'the coolest bar in New Jersey', with some board games and half a ping-pong table. Barney, after making a bad joke (He likes only 2 types of fish, sucker-fish and blow-fish), asks someone to give him a fist bump, but no one agrees. He declares that he will not lower his arm until someone gives him a fist pound, but is still ignored.Robin arrives, and says she has to go back to her old job. Robin didn't get the job, she only got a chance to audition for the job, but in her excitement, Robin didn't hear everything and simply quit before she had a new job in hand. Lily and Barney manage to stop her, reminding her of how humiliating it was there, and Robin relents.\nTed is shocked to find Stella expects him to move to New Jersey when they get married. Meanwhile Stella did not want to move in with him, thinking he was joking (Ted had mentioned it a few months ago while drinking and Stella had replied sarcastically, thinking he was making a joke), as Manhattan is not a safe place to raise her daughter. She asks Ted to go to the local store to get some beer, where he continues to worry about living in New Jersey, as he feels he will never go back to the city. Marshall seems more open to the idea of living out in New Jersey. He loves the fact that everything in New Jersey has a built-in cup holder. Barney continues to make jokes, hoping for his fist bump, as he seems to be in some pain.Robin manages to sneak a call to her old studio, and asks for her job back. Since her replacement is terrified of going on air, her producer agrees, but only if she can make it to the studio in time for the broadcast in half an hour. She steals Stella's daughter's bike, and sets off.When Ted and Marshall get back, Ted confronts Stella about moving to New Jersey, and she responds that she does not want to uproot her daughter. She also states New Jersey is better than New York, a statement that upsets both Ted and Lily. They begin to argue over which is better, while Barney desperately asks someone to bump him.Robin, meanwhile, is seen performing incredible stunts in order to make it to the studio in time, even back flipping on her stolen bike over a cab that has crashed in the road, at least according to Ted's second-hand telling of the story.Lily suggests that Stella will grow to love New York, as Marshall did. Marshall reveals he hates New York, as the city is designed for people who are smaller than him, and actually loves New Jersey, with its big stores, lawns and cup holders on everything. NYC is very loud, and is the city that never sleeps. Marshall likes to sleep. NYC has tiny doorways built 150 yrs ago and Marshall has bruises all over his body from bumping into them. Ted refuses to relent, and Stella storms out.Ted goes to find her, but instead finds Stella's daughter Lucy (Darcy Rose Byrnes), who was woken up by the argument. He reads her a bedtime story to get her back to sleep. Realizing the importance of Stella's reason for staying, Ted, upon encountering her, agrees to move in, saying New Jersey wins.Robin arrives at the studio just in time, pushing her nervous replacement out of the way, and immediately going on air. After her first story again contains a bad pun, she decides she was right to quit, and leaves. Barney and Lily watch, and Lily says they helped her do that, giving him the fist bump he desired. Despite this, he quickly makes another bad joke, and asks for a high five, which he does not receive, and is still asking later at the bar. Robin reveals she did not get the job she auditioned for, but was offered another, and is going to move to Japan. Barney, shocked, lowers his hand."}}, "castle": {"season_8": {"episode_2": "Beckett is on the run with Vikram Singh, the CIA analyst who discovered the identity thefts and their purpose, and under mercenary attack, but gets pulled out by Castle's top-secret agent step-mother.

She's covered with rose petals and has sunflowers over her eyes. We then cut to a party where a woman introduces the \"Master of the Macabre,\" Richard Castle, who has just released Storm Fall, the conclusion to his bestselling Derek Storm series. He laps up the attention, posing for pictures and signing autographs. Meanwhile, back at the dead woman's apartment, the police have arrived. The lead detective, Kate Beckett, is told that the victim is Allison Tisdale, a twenty-four-year old social worker. She was shot twice in the chest before being posed and Beckett realizes that she has seen this scene before; it's straight out of a Richard Castle novel, \"Flowers For Your Grave.\"Back at the party, Castle talks to his publisher (and ex-wife), the woman who introduced him before. She wants to know why he killed off Derek Storm. He says it's because writing Derek Storm isn't fun anymore but he can still write bestsellers. His publisher claims that she was told he hasn't written anything in months and that if she doesn't get a new manuscript within the next few weeks, the company will demand the return of his advance. Castle counters that he already returned it divorcing her. At the bar, his daughter, Alexis, is doing homework while his mother, Martha, orders a drink. Castle tells her to stop discussing his work with his publisher before she goes to flirt with an older gentleman. He then tells his daughter that he should be committed for allowing her to move in with them. When she complains that he shouldn't talk like that in front of her, Castle tells her she should go out and have some fun so she can have stories she can't tell her children. He goes on to talk about why he killed Derek, how bored he is with him and with the same old people and questions at the parties. He says that just once, he wants someone to come up and say something new. Detective Beckett then comes up and says she needs to ask him a few questions.At the police station, Beckett interrogates Castle, citing his rap sheet (he once stole a police horse while nude). The charges were dropped because of his friendship with the Mayor. He tries to charm his way out, but Beckett doesn't respond. She shows him a picture of Allison Tisdale; Castle doesn't recognize her. She then shows him pictures of Martin Fisk, a lawyer who is also dead. Castle doesn't recognize him either. She then shows him pictures of the two crime scenes. Castle recognizes the scene as being from \"Flowers For Your Grave\" and Beckett says that Martin Fisk's body was found in a scene out of his book \"Hell Hath No Fury.\" Castle says that Beckett must be a pretty big fan of his, commenting that only hard-core fans read those books. Beckett, flustered, asks if those fans ever write him any disturbing letters, saying that sometimes killers try to contact the object of their obsession. Castle mentions he already knows this as being familiar with psychopaths is an occupational hazard. He gives her permission to go through his fan mail before asking if he can have copies of the pictures, because having a copycat will make the other authors in his poker group jealous.At home, Martha is singing and dancing to piano accompaniment while Alexis is in the kitchen doing homework wearing earplugs. Alexis asks him if he's in trouble, but Castle assures her that the police only want his help on a case. They discuss the two murders before they go to bed. In the morning, at the station, Beckett comes in with a box full of Castle's books. She gives them to two other detectives, Ryan and Esposito, to read so they will recognize any other copycat murder scenes. The books belong to Beckett and Ryan and Esposito tease for being such a fan. She later tells Esposito that she reads them because she's curious about how people can do these things to each other. Castle arrives, offering his help in the investigation. They go through his fan mail together in an interrogation room where Castle flirts a little with Beckett. She asks if he's there to annoy her. He says he wants to know why those people were murdered like that. That there is always a story that makes everything make sense. He points out that people like Bennett do not usually become cops. He reasons that something must have happened to someone she cared about and guesses that the case was never solved. Beckett, upset about how close his observations were, is silent and sad before finding a letter in which someone has drawn a picture that looks exactly like Allison Tisdale's murder.Back at her desk, Beckett says that the lab got prints off of the letter but they don't know whose because the system is backlogged and it will take a week to find out. Castle promptly calls the Mayor and says that they will get their prints in an hour. As Beckett begins to chew him out for jumping the line, they get a call that there's been another murder. A girl, Kendra Pitney, is floating face-down in a pool in a prom dress with a knife in her back. They pull her out of the water and Castle, ignoring Beckett's orders to stay put, goes to talk to the Lanie, the Medical Examiner. She reveals that the girl was killed elsewhere and posed before Beckett drags Castle away to tell him that she expects him to obey her orders. He points out that if the killer was following his books, the dress should be blue. He asks if they've found a connection between the victims or a motive, but Beckett says that since they're dealing with a serial killer, it doesn't matter. She then gets a call that the fingerprints belong to a Kyle Cabot.They pull up to his apartment and break down the door. Inside, they find newspaper articles about the killings along with drawings, letters, and Castle's books. In another room, the walls are covered with book covers, photos, and articles about Castle, which he finds to be creepy (he has once again ignored Beckett's order to stay put). Esposito finds Allison's blouse and the handgun that probably killed her. Kyle Cabot is found in a closet beating his head against the wall. In an interrogation room, he refuses to speak and Beckett says that he has Pervasive Developmental Disorder and that his caseworker was Allison Tisdale. Castle is not sure that Kyle is the killer as it makes for a poor story. Later that night, Beckett goes over the case while Castle plays poker with three author buddies. He is preoccupied thinking about the case, discussing it with the others as if it is a story he's working on. They, too, are dissatisfied with the ending, saying that the \"story\" needs a character that works to prove Kyle is innocent.In the morning, Beckett catches Castle going through the files on her desk. He apologizes before giving her a gift and leaving. She starts to go about her day before becoming suspicious and realizing that he took the files related to the case. She finds him at the library and arrests him. As he's being led away, he calls back that the rose petals Allison was covered with were different than the ones in his book and that she should make a note of it since it means Kyle Cabot is innocent. Back at the station, Martha and Alexis are there to take him home. Captain Montgomery has agreed to drop the charges as long as Castle promises not to interfere in the case. Castle still insists that Kyle is innocent, though. This gets to Beckett and she goes back over the case, eventually coming to the same conclusion as Castle. He discusses the case with Martha and Alexis on the way home. He reasons that since Allison was the only one who knew anything about Kyle, she must have been the one the real killer wanted dead.Castle goes to see Allison's father, arriving at the same time as Beckett. Allison's father says that she had no enemies, was not wealthy, but stood to inherit part of her father's estate when he died. Outside, Castle informs Beckett that Tisdale is dying; he was wearing make-up, was sickly thin, and was wearing a toupee. They go to interview Harrison Tisdale, Allison's brother. He says that she wanted to see the best in people and even tried to get Kyle Cabot a job at his company. Beckett gets him to admit that his father is dying and asks him where he was on the day of his sister's murder. He says he was out of the country for all three murders and shows them his passport. Back at the station, Ryan says that Harrison purchased three tickets out of the country that match up with the dates of the murders. Castle suggests that Harrison bought a second passport. Beckett orders Ryan and Esposito to keep an eye on Harrison and goes to get a search warrant for Harrison's home and office. Meanwhile, Harrison has gone home to shred the evidence.When the police arrive, they tell Becket that Harrison's business is going under; that's his motive for murder. Before going in, she handcuffs Castle to the car to make sure he stays put this time. As soon as she's gone, he pulls a handcuff key out of his pocket only to drop it on the ground. Harrison puts the remaining evidence in a garbage bag and runs down the fire escape. Meanwhile, Castle sees Harrison coming down the fire escape, finally gets free, and calls Beckett to tell her about Harrison before running after him himself. Beckett runs after both of them, but by the time she catches up, Harrison has taken Castle hostage. Castle guesses that when Harrison asked his father for money, he refused, so he took revenge on his father by taking away Allison, the only thing he had ever loved. Castle then decks him and takes his gun. Beckett cuffs him and takes him away. When everything is over, Castle offers to take her out but she turns him down and walks away. He goes home and works on his new manuscript. The next day, Beckett gets called into Captain Montgomery's office.

Nobody in the Castle household is happy about this development, including Alexis, who finds her mother to be a disruptive influence in her life, and Castle's mother, Martha, who sees in Meredith a younger and very unflattering mirror image. When Castle complains about Meredith to Beckett, she is highly unsympathetic when he describes her as his \"deep-fried Twinkie\" (something that's great once in a while, but you wouldn't want to have on a daily basis) and points out that he can't help but have sex with her because \"The thing with crazy people is, the sex is terrific!\"", "episode_10": "When the plastic surgeon Dr. Joshua Leeds is found dead asphyxiated by plastic bag and tortured by broken fingers, Castle, Beckett and her team investigate the case.
